Let's see. I need to figure out how to solve this Baba Is You level based on the current observation. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I can move and push things, right? My goal is usually to reach a ""win"" object, but I should check if any rules have changed that.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ""win"" rule located 7 steps to the right and 3 steps up. But there are walls blocking the path. Let me visualize the map. There's a wall cluster 2 steps to the right and various steps up, down. Also, there's a key 2 steps up. Maybe I need to pick up the key to unlock something? But how?

The ""key"" rule is at 6 steps right and 1 step down. Wait, but how do I get there? The active rule is ""baba is you,"" so I can move as Baba. Let's see the positions:

- Current position isn't specified, but the rules and objects are spread around. Let me check the positions again. The ""win"" rule is 7 right and 3 up. So maybe the starting point is somewhere nearby? Also, there's a door 2 steps left and 2 steps down, and a ""door"" rule at 5 right and 3 down. So if I can make the door passable by changing its rule, maybe that's a path.

But first, I need to get to the key. The key is 2 steps up. Are there walls blocking that path? Let me see the walls around. To the right, there are walls at 2 steps right and 3 up, 2 steps right and 2 up, etc. So maybe the path up is blocked by walls. But if I can move the ""is"" rule, which is at 6 right and 3 up, perhaps I can change a rule to create a path.

Wait, the rule ""is"" is movable because it's not a ""STOP"" object. So if I move the ""is"" text block, I can change existing rules by combining them. For example, if I move ""is"" next to ""baba"" and ""win,"" I could make ""baba is win,"" which would make Baba the win object. But that's probably not the immediate solution.

Alternatively, the key is at 6 right and 1 down. To get there, I need to move right and down. But there's a wall at 2 right and 1 down. Wait, the wall at 2 right and 1 down is a physical wall, so I can't go through it. Unless I can change its property. The ""wall"" rule is at 3 left and 2 up. So if I can move that ""wall"" rule to another position, maybe I can remove the wall.

But how do I get the ""wall"" rule to the wall's position? Let's see. The ""wall"" rule is 3 steps left and 2 steps up from the starting point. If I move that rule to where the actual wall is (2 right and 1 down), then the wall's property would change. But I need to pick up the ""wall"" rule. Since ""baba is you,"" I can push objects. So maybe I can move towards the ""wall"" rule and push it to the wall's position.

Wait, the ""wall"" rule is 3 left and 2 up. Let me calculate the direction. If I'm at the starting position, moving left 3 steps and up 2 steps gets me to the ""wall"" rule. But there might be obstacles. Alternatively, maybe the starting position is near the bottom left? The door is 2 left and 2 down, which suggests that the starting point might be somewhere else. This is getting a bit confusing without seeing the actual grid.

Alternatively, let's think about the key. If I can get the key, maybe I can use it to unlock the door. The door is at 2 left and 2 down, and the ""key"" rule is at 6 right and 1 down. To reach the key, I need to move right and down. But the path might be blocked. Let me check the walls around the key's area. There's a wall at 2 right and 1 down, so that's blocking the way. If I can remove that wall by changing its rule, maybe I can get past.

The ""wall"" rule is at 3 left and 2 up. If I can move that ""wall"" rule to the position of the actual wall (2 right and 1 down), then that wall would become something else. For example, if I move the ""wall"" rule to the wall's position and make it ""stop"" or ""push,"" but ""stop"" is already a rule at 1 left and 2 up. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a ""rule"" that makes the wall passable. But I need to have the ""is"" rule to do that. The ""is"" rule is at 6 right and 3 up. Let's see, if I can move the ""is"" rule next to the ""wall"" rule and the ""baba"" or another subject, I can create a new rule. For example, moving ""is"" next to ""wall"" and ""stop"" would make ""wall is stop,"" making walls immovable, which they already are. Not helpful.

Wait, the current active rule is ""baba is you."" So I can move Baba and any object that's not stopped. The ""rule"" objects are movable unless they're part of a ""stop"" rule. The ""is"" rule is movable, as per the active rules. So perhaps the strategy is to move the ""is"" rule to combine with other rules to change the game.

The goal is to reach the ""win"" rule at 7 right and 3 up. But the path is blocked by walls. If I can make Baba a ""win"" by saying ""baba is win,"" that would immediately make the goal to be where Baba is. But to do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" and ""win.""

The ""baba"" rule is at 3 left and 3 down, and the ""win"" rule is at 7 right and 3 up. The ""is"" rule is at 6 right and 3 up. So if I can move the ""is"" rule from 6 right, 3 up to somewhere between ""baba"" and ""win,"" then I can create the ""baba is win"" rule.

But how to get there? Let's see the positions. The ""is"" is currently 6 right and 3 up. The ""win"" is 7 right and 3 up. So if I move the ""is"" one step right to 7 right and 3 up, then place it next to ""win,"" but ""baba"" is at 3 left and 3 down. That's far away.

Alternatively, maybe the current position of Baba is near the ""is"" rule. Let's assume Baba is somewhere in the area. If I can move towards the ""is"" rule, then push it towards the ""baba"" and ""win"" rules. But the path might be blocked by walls.

Alternatively, maybe the key is necessary. If I can get the key, then unlock the door. The door is at 2 left and 2 down. To unlock it, I need to be holding the key. So perhaps the steps are: move to the key, pick it up (if possible), then go to the door and unlock it. But how do you pick up a key in Baba Is You? You need a rule like ""key is push"" or ""key is you,"" but the current rule is ""key is you""? Wait, no. The current rules are only ""baba is you."" The other rules are ""win,"" ""stop,"" ""wall,"" ""is,"" etc., but they are all in the rule blocks.

Wait, the ""key"" rule is a text block that says ""key IS [something]"". Looking at the objects, the ""key"" rule is at 6 right and 1 down. The actual key object is at 2 up. So perhaps the key's rule is separate. To pick up the key, maybe I need to have a rule that allows me to take it. Since ""baba is you,"" I can move, but the key is an object. If the key is not stopped, I can push it. But the key's rule is ""rule `key` 6 steps to the right and 1 step down,"" which means the key's property is defined by that rule. But the current active rules don't specify anything about the key except its position. So unless there's a rule like ""key is push,"" I can't move the key. But since there's no such rule, I can't push the key directly. Wait, but maybe I can create a rule that makes the key pushable.

If I can move the ""is"" rule next to ""key"" and ""push"" or ""you,"" then I can create ""key is push"" or ""key is you."" But ""you"" is already a rule at 1 left and 3 down. So if I make ""key is you,"" then the key becomes controllable. But where is the ""you"" rule? It's at 1 left and 3 down. So maybe moving the ""is"" rule to that area.

But this is getting complicated. Let's recap the steps:

1. Current active rule: Baba is You. So I can move Baba and any object that's not stopped.
2. Goal is to reach the ""win"" rule at 7 right, 3 up, but blocked by walls.
3. Key is at 2 up, possibly needed to unlock a door.
4. Door is at 2 left, 2 down. Maybe the door is locked, requiring the key.
5. To unlock the door, there might be a rule like ""door is lock,"" which would require the key. But I need to check if such a rule exists.

Looking at the objects, there's a ""door"" rule at 5 right and 3 down. The actual door is at 2 left and 2 down. So the door's rule is separate. If the door's rule is ""door is lock,"" then having the key would let me unlock it. But how to change that rule.

Alternatively, maybe the door can be pushed if it's not stopped. The ""stop"" rule is at 1 left and 2 up. So unless the door is defined as stop, I can push it. But the door's rule is ""door is [something]"". If the rule is ""door is push,"" then I can move it, but if it's ""door is stop,"" then I can't. Currently, the door's rule is at 5 right and 3 down, which might be a separate rule. Not sure.

Alternatively, the solution might be to make Baba a win by creating ""baba is win."" To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" and ""win."" The ""baba"" rule is at 3 left and 3 down, and ""win"" is at 7 right and 3 up. The ""is"" rule is at 6 right and 3 up. So if I can move the ""is"" one step to the left to 5 right and 3 up, then next step to 4 right and 3 up, etc., until it's between ""baba"" and ""win."" But the path might be blocked by walls.

Looking at the walls: there's a wall at 2 right and 3 up, 2 right and 2 up, 2 right and 1 up, 2 right and 1 down. So the area to the right is blocked. The ""is"" rule is at 6 right, 3 up. So moving left from there would be towards lower right positions. To get to the ""baba"" rule at 3 left and 3 down, that's a long way left and down. But there are walls in the way. For example, at 2 right and 3 up, which is blocking the path up. So moving left from 6 right, 3 up, the next step left would be 5 right, 3 up. Is there a wall there? Not sure. The walls are at specific positions. The wall objects are at various positions, but the rules are separate.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the key to unlock something. If I can get the key, then maybe I can place it near the door to unlock it. The door is at 2 left, 2 down. The key is at 2 up. So the path from key to door is down and left. But there are walls in the way. Let's see: from key at 2 up, to get down to door at 2 left, 2 down, I need to move down twice and left once. But there's a wall at 2 right and 1 down, which is blocking the way right. Unless I can remove that wall by changing its rule.

The wall at 2 right, 1 down is a physical wall. Its rule is at 3 left, 2 up (the ""wall"" rule). So if I can move the ""wall"" rule to the position of the actual wall (2 right, 1 down), then that wall's property would change. For example, if the ""wall"" rule is moved there, and combined with ""is"" to make ""wall is stop,"" but that's what it already is. Hmm.

Alternatively, moving the ""wall"" rule to another position. If I can move the ""wall"" rule away, then the physical wall might disappear. But how? Since ""baba is you,"" I can move objects unless they're stopped. The ""wall"" rule is not stopped, so I can move it. If I move the ""wall"" rule from 3 left, 2 up to, say, 2 right, 1 down (where the actual wall is), then the text block ""wall"" would be there, defining that position as a wall. But that's the same as before. Unless I move it to a different position and combine it with another rule.

For example, moving the ""wall"" rule next to ""stop"" and ""is"" to create ""wall is stop,"" which it already is. Not helpful. Alternatively, moving it to create ""wall is push"" so that walls can be pushed. But then I could push the physical walls out of the way.

But how to do that. Let's see: the ""is"" rule is at 6 right, 3 up. If I can move the ""is"" rule next to ""wall"" and ""push,"" then create ""wall is push."" But where is the ""push"" rule? I don't see a ""push"" rule in the current objects. The rules present are ""is,"" ""win,"" ""wall,"" ""stop,"" ""baba,"" ""you,"" ""key,"" and ""door.""

So unless I can create a ""push"" rule by combining existing ones, but I don't see a ""push"" text block. So maybe that's not possible.

Alternatively, maybe the solution is to make the door passable by changing its rule. The door's rule is at 5 right, 3 down. If I can move that rule to a different position and combine it with ""is"" and another property, like ""open"" or ""push."" But again, without a ""push"" or ""open"" rule, it's tricky.

Wait, the key is present. If I can make the key a ""you"" then I can control it. But the key is an object. If I make ""key is you,"" then the key becomes controllable. But how? The ""you"" rule is at 1 left, 3 down. So if I can move the ""is"" rule next to ""key"" and ""you,"" then create ""key is you.""

But the ""key"" rule is at 6 right, 1 down. The ""you"" rule is at 1 left, 3 down. So the distance is significant. Let's see, moving from the current ""is"" position at 6 right, 3 up, to reach the ""key"" rule at 6 right, 1 down, I need to move down two steps. But are there walls in the way? The position 6 right, 2 up is a wall? Looking at the objects, there's a wall at 2 steps right and 2 up. Not sure about 6 right. Maybe it's open.

Assuming I can move the ""is"" rule down to 6 right, 1 down (next to the ""key"" rule), then move it left to 5 right, 1 down, etc., until it's next to the ""you"" rule at 1 left, 3 down. That seems a long way, but perhaps possible.

Alternatively, maybe the key isn't necessary, and the real solution is to make Baba the win by creating the rule ""baba is win."" To do that, I need to bring the ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" and ""win.""

The ""baba"" rule is at 3 left, 3 down. The ""win"" rule is at 7 right, 3 up. The ""is"" rule is at 6 right, 3 up. So moving the ""is"" rule from 6 right, 3 up to, say, 5 right, 3 up, then 4 right, 3 up, etc., leftward, until it's next to ""baba."" But the path is blocked by walls. For example, at 2 right, 3 up there's a wall. So moving left from 6 right, the path would be open until 5 right, 3 up, then 4 right, 3 up, etc., assuming no walls in between.

Alternatively, maybe there's a different approach. The ""rule `is` 1 step to the right and 1 step down"" is another ""is"" rule. So there are multiple ""is"" rules. Maybe using that to create multiple rules.

For example, moving one ""is"" rule to create ""baba is win"" and another ""is"" rule to create ""you is win,"" but not sure.

Alternatively, since the door is at 2 left, 2 down, and there's a ""door"" rule at 5 right, 3 down, maybe changing the door's rule to ""door is key"" would require a key to pass through. But how to do that. If I can make ""door is key,"" then stepping on the door would require a key, which I have. But I need to create that rule.

To create ""door is key,"" I need to move the ""is"" rule next to ""door"" and ""key."" The ""door"" rule is at 5 right, 3 down, and the ""key"" rule is at 6 right, 1 down. The ""is"" rule is at 6 right, 3 up. So moving the ""is"" rule down to 6 right, 2 down, then left to 5 right, 2 down, next to the ""","

Let's try to figure out how to solve this Baba Is You level. The goal is usually to reach the WIN object, but the rules here are ""baba is you,"" so I start as Baba. First, I need to look at the active rules and the objects on the map.

The active rules are only ""baba is you,"" which means I can move around, push things that aren't STOP, and manipulate the rules by moving the text blocks labeled 'is', 'win', 'wall', etc.

Looking at the objects, there's a key 2 steps up. I see walls everywhere, especially to the right. The 'is' rule block is 6 steps to the right and 3 up. The 'win' is one step further right. Also, there are rules defining wall, stop, key, and door.

My plan: Get the key first to possibly unlock the door. But to do that, I need to reach the key which is 2 steps up. However, the path is blocked by walls on the right. The wall rules are defined by the 'rule wall' block at 3 steps left and 2 up. If I can change that rule, maybe I can walk through walls.

But how? I can move the 'is' block to create new rules. The 'is' block is at 6 right, 3 up. If I move that 'is' block next to the 'wall' rule, I could make ""wall is stop"" or something else. Wait, but currently, the 'wall' rule is at 3 left, 2 up. So maybe I need to bring the 'is' next to the 'wall' rule to change its property.

Alternatively, the 'key' is 2 steps up. Let me check the path. From my starting position (assuming I'm at 0,0), moving up two steps would get me to the key. But the path right is blocked by walls. Let me see the map structure.

Looking at the objects listed:

- The walls are positioned such that moving right three steps from the start would hit walls. The 'is' rule is far to the right (6 steps right, 3 up). The key is 2 steps up. So maybe I need to move vertically first to reach the key.

But the walls are a problem. The 'stop' rule is at 1 left and 2 up. So if I approach from the left, there's a STOP there. Hmm. Alternatively, if I can change the 'wall' rule to something else, like making walls pushable or not stop.

Wait, the existing rules are 'baba is you', and other rules are things like 'wall is wall' (from the 'rule wall' at 3 left, 2 up). So the current rule is wall is still wall. If I can move the 'is' block to make 'wall is stop', that would make walls impassable. But maybe I need to create a new rule that lets me pass through walls.

Alternatively, maybe I can make myself a key by moving the 'is' block next to 'baba' and 'key'. Let me think. The rule 'baba is you' is active. If I can make 'baba is key', then I would become a key, which can maybe open doors. But the door is 2 steps left and 2 steps down. However, the door's rule is 'rule door' at 5 right, 3 down. Hmm.

First, let's try to get the key. To reach the key at 2 steps up, I need to move up twice. But the path to the right is blocked by walls. Wait, the walls are to the right of the starting position. So moving up two steps from the start would position me at (0,2), and the key is there. But the walls are at 2 steps right and 3 up, etc. So if I move up, am I blocked by walls above?

Looking at the walls listed, the ones above me (since key is 2 up) are at 2 steps right and 2 up, 1 step up, and 3 steps up. So if I move up once, from (0,0) to (0,1), then up again to (0,2), which is where the key is. But are there walls blocking that path? The walls listed are at 2 steps right in various positions. So horizontally, moving left or right from the key's position (0,2) would hit walls. But vertically, moving up from (0,0) to (0,1) and then to (0,2) should be free, except if there's a wall in between.

Wait, the key is at 2 steps up, so maybe the path is clear. Let me check the objects again. The key is listed as ""key 2 step up"". So if I'm at the starting position, moving up two steps lands me on the key. Are there any walls in between? The walls to the right are at 2 steps right and 3 up, etc., so vertically above, there are no walls in the direct path. So perhaps I can just move up twice to get the key.

But wait, the initial active rules only have ""baba is you"". So I can move up. Let me try that. Move up once to (0,1), then up again to (0,2) and pick up the key. Then, with the key, maybe I can unlock the door. The door is at 2 steps left and 2 steps down from my current position (after getting the key). But I need to see where the door is located. The door is at ""door 2 step to the left and 2 steps down"". So from (0,2), moving left two steps would be (-2,2), then down two steps to (-2,0). But there's a wall at 2 steps right and 3 steps down, but that's to the right. Wait, the door's position is 2 left and 2 down from where? Maybe the door's coordinates are relative to the key's position. Hmm, this is getting confusing. Maybe I need to visualize the grid.

Alternatively, perhaps after getting the key, I can move to the door. But the door is likely behind a STOP or WALL. The 'door' rule is at 5 steps right and 3 steps down. So maybe the door is an object that can only be opened if you have a key. But in the current rules, the door's behavior isn't defined. The active rules only have ""baba is you"". So unless there's a rule like ""door is win"" or ""key is open"", the door might not be passable.

Wait, the initial active rules don't include anything about the door. The 'rule door' is at 5 right, 3 down. So unless I create a rule that makes the door passable or defines what opening it does, I might need to manipulate those rules.

Alternatively, after getting the key, maybe I can move to the door's position and use the key there. But how? Unless the key can be placed on the door. In Baba Is You, sometimes placing a key on a door makes it open. But that requires the game to have a rule like ""key is open"" or ""door needs key"".

Since the current rules don't have that, I might need to create such a rule. For that, I need to move the 'is' block to combine with 'key' and 'door'. The 'is' block is at 6 right, 3 up. So moving that 'is' block to the area where the key and door are could help.

But first, let's try to get the key. If moving up twice is possible, then that's the first step. So the action would be 'up', then 'up' again. Let me confirm that there are no walls blocking that path. From the starting position, moving up two steps: the walls are at 2 steps right and various positions. So vertically, the path should be clear. So moving up twice to get the key.

Once I have the key, then I need to figure out how to reach the door. The door is at 2 left and 2 down from where? Let's assume I'm at the key's position (0,2). Moving left two steps would be (-2,2), then down two steps to (-2,0). But there's a wall at 2 steps right and 3 steps down (from the start position, that's (2, -3)), which is to the right, not blocking my path. However, the 'stop' rule is at 1 left and 2 up, which is at (-1,2). So if I move left from (0,2) to (-1,2), which is the 'stop' rule's position. Then moving further left to (-2,2) would hit a wall? Wait, the walls listed include ""wall 2 steps to the right and 3 step up"" which is (2,3), but I'm moving left. Are there walls to the left?

Looking at the objects, the walls are mostly on the right. There's a wall at 3 steps left and 2 up, which is (-3,2). But between (0,2) and (-2,2), are there walls? The objects listed don't mention walls in the left area except for the one at (-3,2). So moving left from (0,2) to (-2,2) should be possible unless there's a wall there. Since it's not listed, I can assume the path is clear. Then moving down from (-2,2) to (-2,0) would reach the door's position. But the door is at 2 steps left and 2 steps down from the key? Maybe I need to check the door's exact position.

Wait, the door is described as ""door 2 step to the left and 2 steps down"". If the key is at my current position (0,2), then moving left 2 steps to (-2,2) and down 2 steps to (-2,0) would place me at the door. But the door's actual position might be different based on the level layout. Alternatively, the door's position is relative to the starting point. The description says ""door 2 step to the left and 2 steps down"" from the starting point. So the door is at (-2, -2). To get there from the key's position (0,2), I need to move left 2 and down 4. But that's a longer path.

This is getting a bit complicated. Maybe the key isn't necessary to reach the WIN condition. The active rules have ""baba is you"", but the WIN is at 7 steps right and 3 up. That's far to the right, blocked by walls. So perhaps the solution involves changing the rules to allow passing through walls or making Baba a different object that can reach WIN.

Another approach: The 'is' block is at 6 right, 3 up. If I can move that 'is' block to create a new rule. For example, moving 'is' next to 'baba' and 'win' to make ""baba is win"", which would make me the win condition. Then I just need to reach that 'baba' rule block. Or maybe make ""win is you"", so I can push the win block.

Alternatively, the 'rule win' is at 7 right, 3 up. If I can change 'win' to 'you', then I would become win. To do that, I need to move the 'is' block to the 'win' rule and combine it with 'you'. The 'you' rule is at 1 left, 3 down. That's a bit far. Alternatively, find the 'you' rule elsewhere.

Looking at the objects, there's a 'rule you' at 1 step to the left and 3 steps down. So if I can move the 'is' block from (6,3) to be next to 'win' (7,3) and 'you' (1,-3), but that's a distance. Maybe I can first move the 'is' block to the 'win' area. Let's see.

The 'is' block is at 6 right, 3 up. To get to the 'win' rule at 7 right, 3 up, I need to move the 'is' block one step to the right. But can I move it? The 'is' block is a text block, so if I'm Baba (you), and there's no rule preventing moving it, I can push it. However, are there any STOP properties in the way?

The objects around the 'is' block: to the right is the 'win' rule at 7 right, 3 up. To the left is at 5 right, 3 up (probably another object). The path to move the 'is' block right would require being adjacent to it. Since I'm starting at, say, (0,0), I need to navigate to (6,3) to move the 'is' block.

But the path from (0,0) to (6,3) is blocked by walls on the right. The walls are at 2 steps right and varying positions. So moving right from (0,0) would hit a wall at 2 right, 0 down. Wait, the walls listed include ""wall 2 steps to the right"" (assuming that's at (2,0)), ""wall 2 steps to the right and 1 step up"" at (2,1), etc. So moving right from (0,0) to (2,0) is a wall, so I can't go that way.

Therefore, to reach the 'is' block at (6,3), I need another path. Maybe moving up first. From (0,0), move up to (0,1), then up to (0,2) to get the key, then perhaps move left or right around the walls.

Alternatively, is there a way to make walls passable? If I can change the 'wall is wall' rule to 'wall is push' or 'wall is nothing', then I could move through them. The 'rule wall' is at 3 left, 2 up. So if I can move the 'is' block next to that 'rule wall' and change its property. For example, moving 'is' to make ""wall is stop"" into ""wall is push"". But how?

To do that, I need to be adjacent to both the 'wall' rule and the 'is' block. The 'wall' rule is at (-3,2) (3 left, 2 up), and the 'is' block is at (6,3). Those are far apart. So unless I can move the 'is' block to near the 'wall' rule, which seems difficult due to the walls, this might not be feasible.

Another idea: Use the key to unlock something. If I have the key, maybe I can place it on the door. The door's rule is at (5,3) (5 right, 3 down). So if I can move the key to the door's position, perhaps that creates a rule like ""door is unlock"". But in the current rules, that's not defined. So maybe I need to create a new rule combining 'key' and 'door' with 'is'.

The 'is' block is at (6,3). If I can move it next to 'key' (6 right, 1 down) and 'door' (5 right, 3 down), maybe create ""key is door"" or ""door is key"". But that would require positioning the 'is' between them. Let's see the positions:

- 'key' is at 6 right, 1 down (assuming ""6 steps to the right and 1 step down"" from the starting point, which is (0,0), so (6,-1)).
- 'door' is at 5 right, 3 down (5, -3).
- 'is' is at (6,3).

To move the 'is' block between 'key' and 'door', I need to navigate there. From (0,0), getting to (6,3) is blocked by walls on the right. So perhaps this isn't possible.

Alternative plan: Make Baba a WIN by creating ""baba is win"". To do that, I need the 'is' block next to 'baba' and 'win'. The 'baba' rule is at 3 left, 3 down (-3,-3), and 'win' is at 7 right, 3 up (7,3). The 'is' block is at (6,3). So moving the 'is' block from (6,3) to between 'baba' (-3,-3) and 'win' (7,3) is impractical due to distance and walls.

Alternatively, use the 'key' to modify a rule. If I have the key, maybe I can push a rule block. But I'm not sure if having the key allows me to do anything extra unless there's a rule like ""key is push"".

Another angle: The 'rule you' is at 1 left, 3 down (-1,-3). If I can make ""baba is you"" into ""baba is win"" and ""you is win"", but I need the 'is' block.

This is getting quite complex. Let's recap:

- I'm Baba, can move up, down, left, right.
- Key is at (0,2), accessible by moving up twice.
- After getting the key, need to reach the door or the WIN.

Possible steps:

1. Move up twice to get the key.
2. Move left and down to the door's position.
3. Use the key to open the door, possibly by creating a ""door is open"" rule.

But to create that rule, I need the 'is' block. The 'is' is at (6,3). To reach it, I need to navigate around the walls. Maybe after getting the key, I can move to the area of the 'is' block.

Alternative route after getting the key:

From (0,2) with the key, move left to (-1,2) (which is the 'stop' rule at (-1,2)), but STOP means I can't move into it. So I can't go past that. Instead, maybe move down to (0,1), then right around the walls.

Wait, the walls on the right are at (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), etc. So moving right from (0,1) would hit the wall at (2,1). So perhaps move up further? But the key is at (0,2), and above that are walls at (2,3) and others.

Alternatively, move left past the 'stop' rule. Since the 'stop' rule is at (-1,2), moving left from (0,2) to (-1,2) is blocked by STOP. So I can't go there. Hmm.

This is tricky. Maybe the solution is to change the 'wall' rule to make walls passable. For that, I need to move","

I need to figure out how to solve this Baba Is You level. The active rule is only ""baba is you,"" so right now I'm Baba, and I can move around unless something is a STOP. Let me look at the objects on the map.

There's a key two steps up, which probably I need to get to open a door. But there are walls blocking the path. The walls are all to the right, so maybe I need to manipulate the rules to bypass them. The rules for wall, stop, and door are in various positions. Let's see:

- Rule `wall` is 3 steps left and 2 steps up. If I can move that text block, maybe I can change what a wall is. But I can only move objects that aren't STOP. The rule `stop` is 1 step left and 2 steps up. So, I can't move the STOP rule directly. Hmm.

- There's a rule `is` at 6 steps right and 3 steps up. The `is` text block is crucial because that's how rules are formed. If I can move that, maybe I can create new rules. But I need to reach it. The path to the `is` rule is blocked by walls on the right. Maybe I need to become something that can move through walls. Since ""baba is you,"" right now I can push non-SHIFT objects, but not STOP. Wait, no—SHIFT allows you to move other objects, but only if you are defined as can move them. If I'm just ""baba is you,"" I can't push STOP objects. So the walls are STOP, meaning I can't go through them. The key is two steps up, but there's a wall there. Oh, wait, the key is two steps up. Let me check the map again.

Looking at the objects: key is 2 step up. So if I move up twice from my current position, I can get the key. But there's a wall two steps to the right and 2 steps up. Wait, the walls are all on the right side. Maybe the key is above some walls. Let me visualize the layout. The player starts somewhere, and the key is two steps up, but there's a wall blocking that path? Or is the key in a position that's accessible if I can move the walls.

Alternatively, maybe I need to change the rule for 'wall' to something else. If I can move the `wall` rule (which is 3 left, 2 up), I could change what a wall is. For example, if I make 'baba is wall', then the walls would become me, and I could walk through them. But to do that, I need to move the `wall` rule text block. However, moving that block would require me to be able to move it. Since right now, I'm Baba, and the only rule is 'baba is you', I can move objects that are not STOP. The `wall` rule is not a STOP, right? The `stop` rule is separate. So maybe I can push the `wall` rule text block.

Wait, but how do I move it? The direction. Let's see, the `wall` rule is 3 steps left and 2 steps up from me. So if I move left three times and up two times, I can get to it. But the path might be blocked. Let's check the obstacles. The walls are two steps to the right in various positions. So maybe I need to navigate around them. For example, to reach the `wall` rule at 3 left and 2 up, I need to go left three, then up two. But there are walls on the right, so maybe moving left is possible. Let me check the wall positions.

Looking at the walls:

- Wall 2 steps right and 3 up.

- Wall 2 right and 2 up.

- Wall 2 right and 1 up.

- Wall 2 right.

So the right side has a vertical line of walls starting two steps right. But the player is probably somewhere else. Let me assume the player is centered. So moving left from the player's position would avoid the right walls. Then, moving left three steps would reach the `wall` rule at 3 left, 2 up. Then, once there, I can pick up the `wall` rule and move it somewhere else to change its definition.

Alternatively, there's a `key` at 2 step up. If I can get that key, maybe I can use it on a door. The door is 2 steps left and 2 steps down. But how to get there? There's a wall to the right, but if I can become the key, maybe the door is unlockable. Wait, but the door's rule is at 5 steps right and 3 steps down. The rule says 'door is door', which might mean it's a door. To unlock it, I might need the key. So if I have the key, maybe I can place it near the door. But doors are typically unlocked by putting the key on them, but in Baba Is You, it might depend on the rules. If the rule is 'key is unlock door', then having the key would let me unlock. But the current rules don't mention that. So maybe I need to create such a rule.

Alternatively, if I can make 'key is you', then I could pick up the key and carry it. But right now, I'm Baba, so I can move objects unless they are STOP. The key is an object, not necessarily STOP. So maybe I can move the key. Wait, the key is at 2 step up. If I move up twice, I can get to the key. But there's a wall two steps to the right and 2 steps up. Wait, does that block my path? If I'm moving up, the walls are on the right, so moving up two steps would take me to the key's position. But the wall is two steps right of where I am, so if I'm moving up, the wall is diagonally right and up. Does that block my path? In Baba Is You, when moving in a direction, you can only move into a cell if there's no object that is STOP in that direction. So if I move up, the cell above me must not be a STOP. The key is two steps up, but the wall is two steps right and two steps up. So the cell directly above me (two steps up) is the key's position. If the key is not a STOP, then I can move into it. Wait, the key is an object, but unless there's a rule that says key is stop, I can move over it. So maybe I can move up twice to get the key.

Once I have the key, I need to get to the door. The door is two steps left and two steps down. To get there, I have to navigate through the walls. But the walls are on the right. If I go left from the key, maybe I can get to the door. However, there's a rule `is` at 6 steps right and 3 steps up, which is quite far. Maybe a better approach is to change the rules.

Alternatively, if I can make 'baba is win', then touching Baba would make me win. But that requires changing the 'win' rule. The 'win' rule is at 7 steps right and 3 steps up. To move that, I need to go right seven steps and up three, but there are walls along the right. So that's probably blocked.

Another idea: the rule `is` is at 6 steps right and 3 steps up. If I can move that 'is' rule, I can create new rules. For example, move 'is' next to 'baba' and 'win' to make 'baba is win'. But again, getting to that 'is' is blocked by walls on the right. Maybe I need to first remove the wall rule.

Wait, the current rules are 'baba is you'. The 'wall' rule is defined as 'rule wall' being at 3 left, 2 up. So that means 'wall is [something]'. But the actual rule for 'wall' is formed by the text block. So the text block 'rule wall' at that position creates the rule 'wall is [something else]'. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the rules. Each text block on the map forms a rule. For example, a text block saying 'BABA IS YOU' is a rule. So the 'rule wall' at 3 left, 2 up would be the text 'wall', and its position defines the subject. Wait, no. In Baba Is You, the rules are formed by text blocks arranged as ""[Subject] IS [Property]"". So if there's a text block that says 'WALL IS STOP', then that's a rule. But in the current observation, the objects include 'rule `wall` 3 step to the left and 2 step up', which I think means that there's a text block 'wall' located at that position. Similarly, 'rule `is` 6 steps to the right...' is a text block 'is' at that position.

Wait, perhaps the way the rules are formed is that each text block is a word, and when they are adjacent horizontally, they form a rule. For example, if there's a 'BABA' text block next to an 'IS' text block next to a 'YOU' text block, that forms the rule 'BABA IS YOU'. So in the current level, the active rule is only 'baba is you' because that's the only horizontal trio of text blocks forming such a rule. The other text blocks like 'wall', 'is', 'win', etc., are separate and need to be combined to form new rules.

But the user's observation lists the active rules as just 'baba is you'. So the other text blocks are separate and not forming active rules yet.

So to create a new rule, I need to move text blocks next to each other to form ""[Subject] IS [Property]"". For example, moving the 'is' text block next to 'baba' and 'win' to make 'baba is win'.

But the problem is accessing those text blocks. The 'is' text block is at 6 steps right and 3 steps up. That's quite far, blocked by walls. The 'key' is at 2 steps up, which is closer. The 'door' is at 2 steps left and 2 steps down. The 'rule door' is at 5 steps right and 3 steps down.

So maybe the strategy is:

1. Get the key by moving up twice. But need to check if the path is clear. The key is two steps up. If moving up twice doesn't hit a wall, then do that.

Looking at the walls: there's a wall at 2 right and 2 up. So if I'm moving up from my current position, the cell directly above me is two steps up. If that cell is the key, and there's no wall in between, then I can move up. Wait, the wall is two steps right and two steps up. So my current position is, say, at (0,0). The wall is at (2,2). The key is at (0,2). So moving up from (0,0) to (0,1), then to (0,2) which is the key. There's no wall in between, so that's possible. So I can move up twice to get the key.

2. Once I have the key, I need to get to the door. The door is at 2 steps left and 2 steps down from my current position after getting the key. So after picking up the key, move left twice and down twice. But there's a wall at 2 steps right and 2 steps down. Wait, the door is at 2 left and 2 down. So from (0,2) after getting the key, moving left twice would take me to (-2,2), then down twice to (-2,0). There's a wall at 2 right and 2 down, which is (2, -2), which is in the opposite direction. So no walls blocking that path. So maybe that's possible.

But then, how does the key help? The door's rule is 'door is door', which might mean it's a door that's always there. In some levels, you need to push the door with the key, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the key needs to be placed on the door. In Baba Is You, sometimes you have to put a key on a door to unlock it. So if I can move the key next to the door, that might work. The door is at 2 left and 2 down. So from my position with the key at (-2,2), moving left twice and down twice would take me to (-2,0), which is next to the door. Then, if the rule is 'key is unlock door', placing the key on the door would open it. But right now, there's no such rule. So I need to create that rule.

To create 'key is unlock door', I need to have the text blocks 'key', 'is', 'unlock', 'door' arranged appropriately. But looking at the available text blocks, there's a 'key' rule at 6 steps right and 1 step down, and a 'door' rule at 5 steps right and 3 steps down. The 'is' rule is at 6 right and 3 up, and another 'is' at 1 right and 1 down.

This seems complicated. Maybe another approach: become the door. If I can make 'baba is door', then touching the door would make me win. But how? To do that, I need to create the rule 'baba is door'. To do that, I need to move the 'is' text block next to 'baba' and 'door'.

The 'baba' rule is at 3 steps left and 3 steps down. The 'is' rule is at 2 left and 3 steps down. The 'door' rule is at 5 right and 3 steps down. So if I can move the 'is' from (2 left, 3 down) to between 'baba' and 'door', that would create 'baba is door'. But moving that 'is' requires getting there. The 'is' is 2 left and 3 down. From my current position (assuming after getting the key at (0,2)), moving left three times and down three times would reach ( -3, 5), which is probably blocked by walls. Alternatively, the player's starting position might be different. This is getting confusing without a visual map.

Alternatively, focus on moving the 'is' text block that's at 6 steps right and 3 steps up. That 'is' is part of the existing rule 'baba is you' if it's next to 'baba' and 'you'. Wait, the active rule is 'baba is you', which must be formed by the text blocks 'baba', 'is', 'you' adjacent horizontally. Looking at the objects, there's a 'rule `baba`' at 3 left and 3 down, 'rule `is`' at 2 left and 3 down, and 'rule `you`' at 1 left and 3 down. So those three are adjacent horizontally, forming 'baba is you'. That's the active rule.

The other 'is' text block is at 6 right and 3 up. If I can move that 'is' next to other text blocks, I can create new rules. For example, moving it next to 'win' to make 'win is [something]'.

But accessing that 'is' is blocked by walls on the right. So maybe I need to first remove the wall rule. The wall rule is at 3 left and 2 up. The text block there is 'wall', so the rule is 'wall is [something]'. But what's it currently? Since the active rules only show 'baba is you', the 'wall' rule must be part of an incomplete rule. Wait, no. Each text block by itself isn't a rule. Rules are formed by three adjacent text blocks: subject, is, property. So the 'wall' text block at 3 left and 2 up is just a standalone word, not part of an active rule. Similarly, the 'stop' text block at 1 left and 2 up is also standalone.

So to create a new rule like 'wall is stop', I need to have the text blocks 'wall', 'is', 'stop' adjacent. The existing 'wall' is at 3 left 2 up, 'is' is at 6 right 3 up (far away), and 'stop' is at 1 left 2 up. It's not possible to arrange them adjacently without moving.

This is getting too complicated. Let me try to outline possible steps:

1. Move up twice to get the key. Check if the path is clear. Since the wall at 2 right and 2 up is diagonally across, moving up from my position (assuming I'm at 0,0) to (0,1) then to (0,2) where the key is. No walls in between, so this should work.

2. After getting the key, move left twice and down twice to reach the door at 2 left and 2 down. Path seems clear.

3. Now, with the key, need to interact with the door. If the door's rule allows being pushed with the key, or if placing the key on it unlocks it. In some levels, having the key in your inventory lets you push the door, but here maybe not. Alternatively, create a rule that the key can unlock the door.

To create 'key is unlock door', I need to have the text blocks 'key', 'is', 'unlock', 'door' arranged. But 'unlock' isn't present on the map. The available text blocks are 'baba', 'is', 'you', 'win', 'wall', 'stop', 'key', 'door'. There's no 'unlock' text block. So that's not possible.

Alternative idea: make the door a pushable object. If the rule 'door is you', then I can push it. But to do that, I need to create 'door is you'. To do that, move the 'is' text block next to 'door' and 'you'.

The 'door' rule is at 5 right and 3 down. The 'you' rule is at 1 left and 3 down. The 'is' rule is at 6 right and 3 up and another at 1 right and 1 down. It's a bit far, but maybe possible.

Alternatively, make 'key is you', so I can carry the key and use it to interact with the door. But to do that, create 'key is you' by moving 'is' next to 'key' and 'you'.

The 'key' is at 6 right and 1 down. The 'you' is at 1 left and 3 down. The 'is' is at 1 right and 1 down. So","

Let's try to figure out how to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. The active rule right now is ""baba is you,"" which means I can move around as Baba. The goal is usually to reach a ""win"" object, but those rules can be changed.

First, I need to look at the objects on the map. The key is 2 steps up. There's a wall blocking the path to the key, and probably to the win condition. The ""win"" rule is way to the right, 7 steps to the right and 3 steps up. That might be behind some walls. The door is 2 steps to the left and 2 steps down, but I don't have the key yet. 

Looking at the rules available: there are several ""is"" rules scattered around. The main ones that stand out are the ""rule `is`"" at 6 steps right and 3 up, 1 step right and 1 down, and 2 steps left and 3 down. If I can move these ""is"" rules, I can create new rules by placing them next to other objects. 

For example, if I can get the ""is"" rule to the key's location, maybe I can make ""key is win"" or something like that. But the key is behind a wall. Let me check the walls. There's a wall 2 steps to the right and 1 step up. Wait, how am I positioned right now? The observation doesn't specify my current position, but maybe I'm starting at the default position. Let's assume I'm near the bottom left since there's a ""rule `baba`"" 3 steps left and 3 down. So maybe I need to move right and up to reach those rules.

One strategy is to move the ""is"" rule to the key's location. The key is 2 steps up. If I can get to the key first, but the path is blocked by walls. Alternatively, maybe change the ""stop"" property. There's a ""rule `stop`"" 1 step left and 2 up. If I can make ""stop is push"" or something, but that might not help immediately. 

Another idea: Since I'm Baba (baba is you), I can move the text blocks if they're not STOP. The ""is"" rules can be moved because they don't have a STOP property active. So the goal is to move an ""is"" block next to another object to create a new rule. For example, moving the ""is"" at 6 right, 3 up next to the ""key"" at 2 up. But how to get there?

First, I need to navigate to the ""is"" rule at 6 right, 3 up. Let's see the path. The walls are 2 steps right and 3 up, so that might be a wall blocking the way. Wait, the wall is 2 steps right and 3 up. So from my starting position (probably at 0,0), moving up 3 steps would hit a wall. Hmm, so maybe I need to go around. The ""is"" rule is 6 steps right and 3 up. But the walls are 2 steps right and 3 up. So maybe I need to go right past the wall? Wait, but walls are STOP, so I can't move through them. 

Alternatively, maybe I can use the existing rules to change the behavior of the walls. For example, if I can make the wall not a STOP, then I could move through it. But the current active rules have ""baba is you"" and the other rules like ""rule `wall` 3 step to the left and 2 step up"" which probably makes that wall a WALL. 

Wait, the active rules are only ""baba is you"" right now. The other rules are text blocks on the map that aren't active unless manipulated. So to create a new rule, I need to move an ""is"" text block next to another object. For example, moving the ""is"" at 6 right, 3 up next to the ""win"" at 7 right, 3 up would make ""win is you"" or something. But I need to get there. 

Alternatively, moving the ""is"" at 1 right, 1 down next to the ""key"" at 6 right, 1 down. That could make ""key is win"" if I can get them adjacent. But how to reach those positions? 

Let me try to outline a possible path. Starting from where I am (assuming near the bottom left where the ""rule `baba`"" is), I need to move right and down to reach the ""is"" at 2 left, 3 down. Wait, the ""rule `baba`"" is at 3 left and 3 down. So maybe I'm at (0,0), and that rule is at (-3, -3). So to reach the ""rule `is`"" at 2 left and 3 down, I need to move left 2 and down 3. But moving left would hit walls? Or perhaps there's a path. 

Alternatively, maybe the key is at 2 up. If I can get to the key, then use it on the door. But the door is 2 left and 2 down. So after getting the key, move left and down. But the door is behind a wall? The wall is 2 right and 2 down. Wait, the wall is 2 steps to the right and 2 steps down from where? Maybe from the key's position. 

This is getting a bit confusing without knowing the exact map layout. Let me try to visualize it. 

Assuming the player is at a starting position, let's say the bottom left corner. The ""rule `baba`"" is 3 steps left and 3 down, which would place it at (-3, -3) relative to the player. The ""is"" rules are at various positions. The key is at 2 up, so relative to the player, that's (0, 2). But there are walls blocking the path. 

The wall at 2 steps right and 3 up is blocking the way up. So to reach the key at 2 up, I need to go around. Maybe through the right side. There's a wall at 2 right and 3 up, but perhaps moving right past it. Wait, but walls are STOP, so I can't move through them. 

Alternatively, maybe I can change the ""wall"" rule. The ""rule `wall`"" is at 3 left and 2 up. If I can move that ""wall"" text block next to another object, but it's 3 left and 2 up. Maybe moving it to create a new rule. 

Alternatively, use the ""is"" rule at 6 right and 3 up. If I can get there, placing it next to the ""win"" at 7 right and 3 up would make ""win is you"". That would make the win condition something I can move into. But how to reach that ""is"" rule? 

The path to 6 right and 3 up is blocked by a wall at 2 right and 3 up. So maybe I need to go around by moving right past the wall. But since the wall is STOP, I can't. Unless I can change the wall's property. 

Wait, the current active rules only have ""baba is you"". The other rules are text blocks on the map. So if I can move the ""wall"" text block (which is a rule) somewhere else. For example, moving the ""rule `wall`"" at 3 left and 2 up next to another object. If I move it next to ""baba"", it would make ""baba is wall"", which would make me a wall, which is STOP. That's bad. 

Alternatively, move the ""is"" rule at 6 right, 3 up next to the ""win"" rule. To do that, I need to move the ""is"" block to the position between the ""win"" and another object. Let's see: the ""win"" is at 7 right, 3 up. The ""is"" is at 6 right, 3 up. So if I move the ""is"" one step right, it would be adjacent to the ""win"", creating ""win is [something]"". But what's next to the ""is"" after moving? Maybe nothing. 

Alternatively, move the ""is"" block to the key's location. The key is at 2 up. The ""is"" block is at 6 right, 3 up. So moving left 4 and down 1. But that's a long way. 

This is tricky. Maybe another approach: Since I'm Baba, I can push objects that are not STOP. The ""stop"" rule is at 1 left and 2 up. So any object with STOP property can't be moved. But the walls are defined by the ""rule `wall`"" at 3 left and 2 up. So as long as that rule exists, the walls are STOP. 

If I can remove the ""rule `wall`"" or change it, that might help. For example, moving the ""wall"" rule next to a different property. Like, moving ""rule `wall`"" to be next to ""is"", making ""is is wall"" which would change the definition of IS. But that's probably not useful. 

Alternatively, move the ""stop"" rule somewhere else. The ""rule `stop`"" is at 1 left and 2 up. If I can move it away, then the walls might no longer be STOP. But how? To move the ""stop"" rule, I need to be able to move it. Since it's a text block, and if it's not defined as STOP, I can move it. But the current active rules have ""baba is you"" and others are just text blocks. The ""stop"" rule is part of the existing rules. Wait, no—the active rules are only ""baba is you"". The other rules are text blocks on the map, but they don't become active unless you create a rule with them. 

So the walls are created by the ""rule `wall`"" text block at 3 left and 2 up. So as long as that exists, wherever that text block is placed, it defines a wall. But the walls mentioned in the objects list are separate. For example, ""wall 2 steps to the right and 3 step up"" is an object that is a wall, but its property is determined by the rules. 

This is getting complicated. Maybe the key is to get the key and use it on the door. The door is at 2 left and 2 down. So if I can reach the key at 2 up, collect it, then move left and down to the door. But the path to the key is blocked by walls. 

Looking at the objects: the key is at 2 step up. There's a wall 2 steps to the right and 1 step up. So to get to the key, which is directly above, maybe I need to move left around the walls. Wait, the walls are on the right. If I move left from my starting position, maybe I can avoid them. 

Assuming I'm at the bottom left where the ""rule `baba`"" is, moving right would take me towards the walls. Moving left would be towards the ""rule `is`"" at 2 left and 3 down. But how to reach the key at 2 up. 

Alternatively, maybe the key is accessible by moving up 2 steps, but there's a wall at 2 right and 3 up. So if I can move left past that wall. Wait, the wall is 2 steps right and 3 up. So if I'm at position (0,0), the wall is at (2,3). To reach the key at (0,2), I need to go up 2, but the path is blocked by the wall at (2,3). So unless I can move the wall or change its property. 

If I can change the wall's property from being a STOP to something else. The ""rule `wall`"" is at 3 left and 2 up. So that's at (-3,2) relative to me. If I can move that ""rule `wall`"" text block to a different position, maybe next to the wall object, changing its property. For example, moving the ""wall"" rule next to a different object so that the wall becomes a different property. 

This is getting too vague. Let's try to outline specific steps. 

Step 1: Move to the key. But blocked by walls. 

Alternative Step 1: Find a way to remove the wall's STOP property. 

To do that, I need to modify the ""rule `wall`"" text block. For example, move it next to a different property. If I can move the ""rule `wall`"" to be next to ""is"", then the new rule would be ""is is wall"", which might not make sense. Or next to ""baba"", making ""baba is wall"", which would make me a wall (STOP). Not good. 

Alternatively, move the ""rule `wall`"" next to ""stop"", creating ""stop is wall"", but that's already the case. 

Hmm. Maybe another approach: Use the ""is"" rule at 6 right, 3 up to create a new rule. If I can move that ""is"" block next to ""baba"", making ""baba is [something]"". For example, if I move the ""is"" to be next to ""key"", then ""key is you"", making the key controllable. But the key is at 2 up. The ""is"" is at 6 right, 3 up. So moving the ""is"" left 4 and down 1. That's a long way. 

Alternatively, move the ""is"" at 1 right, 1 down next to the ""key"" at 6 right, 1 down. To do that, I need to move the ""is"" block 5 steps left. But again, there are walls blocking the path. 

This is really challenging. Maybe I should try to move towards the ""is"" rule at 1 right, 1 down. That's closer. If I can get there, then maybe I can create a new rule. 

Assuming I'm at the starting position (near the ""rule `baba`"" at 3 left, 3 down), moving right and down towards the ""is"" at 1 right, 1 down. Let's see: from (0,0), to reach (1, -1), I need to move right once and down once. But are there walls in the way? The walls listed are at various positions. The wall at 2 right and 3 up is up high, not in the way. The wall at 2 right and 1 step up is also to the right. So moving right once should be possible if there's no wall there. 

Once I reach the ""is"" at 1 right, 1 down, I can then move it next to another object. For example, the ""key"" is at 6 right, 1 down. So moving the ""is"" block left 5 steps to be next to the key. But that's a long move. 

Alternatively, move the ""is"" block to the door's location. The door is at 2 left and 2 down. But that's further away. 

Wait, maybe the key is at 2 up. So if I can get the ""is"" block to the key's location, then create ""key is win"". For example, moving the ""is"" at 6 right, 3 up to be next to the key at 2 up. That would require moving left 4 steps and down 1 step. But again, there's a wall at 2 right and 3 up, which is in the way if I'm moving up. 

This is really tricky. Maybe I need to focus on moving the ""is"" block that's closest. The one at 1 right, 1 down. Let's try that. 

Action: Move right once to get to the position next to the ""is"" block. Then move down to be adjacent to it. Once I have the ""is"" block, I can move it elsewhere. 

But how to specify the exact direction. The observation says the ""is"" is 1 step to the right and 1 step down from where? Assuming I'm at the starting position (0,0), the ""is"" is at (1, -1). So moving right (east) once, then down (south) once to be adjacent. 

Once I'm next to the ""is"" block, I can move it. Since I'm Baba (you), and the ""is"" block isn't STOP, I can push it. So action: push the ""is"" block one step in any direction. For example, moving it left to be next to the ""key"" at 6 right, 1 down. Wait, no, the key is at 2 up, which is (0,2). The ""is"" is at (1,-1). Moving it left would take it to (0,-1), still not near the key. 

Alternatively, move the ""is"" block up to (1,0). Then, maybe from there, move it towards the key. But this requires multiple steps, and the agent only gets one action per turn. 

Alternatively, use the ""is"" block to create a new rule immediately. For example, if I can move the ""is"" block next to the ""key"" in one move. But the distance is too great. 

Maybe the key is at 2 steps up from the player. If I can move up twice, avoiding the walls. The wall at 2 right and 3 up is up high, but the player's path to the key at 2 up is blocked by walls on the right. So moving left to get past the walls. 

For example, if the player is at (0,0), the key is at (0,2). There's a wall at (2,3), but that's not in the way. The walls listed are at various positions, but the immediate path up from (0,0) is clear except for the wall at 2 right and 3 up, which is further up. So maybe the player can move up twice to reach the key. 

But wait, looking at the objects list: there's a wall 2 steps to the right and 3 step up. So if the player moves up twice to (0,2), which is where the key is, but then there's a wall at (2,3), which is not in the way. So maybe the path to the key is clear. 

Wait, the key is at 2 step up. So from (0,0) to (0,2). Are there any walls in between? The walls listed are:

- wall 2 steps to the right and 3 step up

- wall 2 steps to the right and 2 step up

- wall 2 steps to the right and 1 step up

- wall 2 steps to the right

Let's try to figure out how to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. The active rule right now is ""baba is you,"" which means whatever I do, I can manipulate the rules by moving the text blocks. The goal is usually to reach the ""win"" condition, but that might change.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key located 2 steps up. Then there are walls all around, particularly to the right. There are also rules like ""is,"" ""win,"" ""wall,"" and ""stop"" scattered around. The door is 2 steps to the left and 2 steps down. 

First, I need to get the key. The key is 2 steps up. But there's a wall 2 steps to the right and 1 step up, which might block my path. Wait, the key is 2 steps up from where I am. But if I try to go up, I might hit the walls. Let me check the positions again. The walls are arranged such that moving right several steps is blocked. Maybe I need to move the ""is"" rule to create a new rule.

The ""is"" rule is 6 steps to the right and 3 steps up. If I can move that ""is"" to combine with other text blocks, maybe I can change something. For example, if I can make ""baba is key"" or ""key is push,"" that might help. But moving the ""is"" requires that the object I'm moving isn't stopped. Since ""is"" itself isn't stopped, I can probably move it.

Alternatively, the ""win"" rule is 7 steps to the right and 3 steps up. If I can make the door a win, that might be easier. But to do that, I'd need to change the ""win"" rule. Let's see, there's a ""door"" rule at 5 steps to the right and 3 steps down. If I can move ""win"" next to ""door"" and ""is,"" then ""door is win"" might become a rule. But how do I get there?

Wait, maybe the first step is to get past the walls. The key is 2 steps up, but there's a wall there. If I have the key, maybe I can unlock something. But I don't have the key yet. Alternatively, if I can push a wall by making ""wall is push,"" then I could move it aside. But the current rules don't have that.

Another approach: since ""baba is you,"" I can move any text block that's not stopped. The ""stop"" rule is at 1 step left and 2 steps up. So I can move the ""is"" blocks. Let's focus on moving the ""is"" at 6 steps right and 3 steps up. If I can bring that ""is"" next to ""baba"" and ""you,"" maybe I can change the rule. But where is the ""you"" rule?

Looking at the objects, there's a ""rule you"" at 1 step left and 3 steps down. So if I can move the ""is"" near ""baba"" and ""you,"" maybe I can create a new rule like ""baba is you"" (which is already there) or ""you is win"" or something. Wait, the ""you"" is already part of the existing rule ""baba is you."" Hmm.

Alternatively, if I can make ""key is you,"" then picking up the key would make me the key, and maybe the key can open the door. But how? The door is a ""stop"" if it's defined as such. There's a ""rule door"" at 5 steps right and 3 steps down. So if I can change ""door is stop"" to ""door is push"" or ""door is win,"" that would help.

Let me map out the positions. The current rules:

- baba is you (active)
- wall is at various positions
- stop is at 1 step left, 2 step up
- key is at 2 step up
- door is at 2 step left, 2 steps down

Possible text blocks on the map:

- rule `is` at 6 right, 3 up
- rule `win` at 7 right, 3 up
- rule `wall` at 3 left, 2 up
- rule `stop` at 1 left, 2 up
- rule `key` at 6 right, 1 down
- rule `baba` at 3 left, 3 down
- rule `is` at 2 left, 3 down
- rule `you` at 1 left, 3 down
- rule `door` at 5 right, 3 down

So the key is 2 steps up. To get there, I need to move up, but there's a wall 2 steps to the right and 2 steps up. Wait, the key is 2 steps up. Let me visualize:

Player's position isn't specified, but the walls are mostly to the right. Maybe the player is somewhere in the middle. Let's assume the player is near the bottom-left.

To get the key at 2 step up, I need to move up. But the path might be blocked by walls. Alternatively, if I can change a wall to a push, then maybe move it aside.

But first, let's think about the ""is"" rules. If I can move the ""is"" at 6 right, 3 up to near the ""key"" at 6 right, 1 down. Wait, that's a big distance. Maybe moving the ""is"" to nearby areas to combine with other rules.

Alternatively, the ""rule `is`"" at 1 step right and 1 step down. That's closer. If I can move that ""is"" to combine with ""door"" and ""win,"" maybe making ""door is win.""

But how to move the ""is"" blocks. To move a text block, I need to be adjacent to it and move in a direction, but the text block must not be stopped. The ""stop"" rule is at 1 left, 2 up, so objects there can't be moved.

The ""is"" at 6 right, 3 up: that's far to the right. Maybe I need to move towards that first. But the player's position isn't clear. Maybe the player is near the lower-left area, given the ""rule baba"" at 3 left, 3 down.

Wait, the ""rule baba"" is 3 steps left and 3 steps down from somewhere. If the player is at that position, then moving down 3 steps would reach the ""rule baba."" But the active rule is ""baba is you,"" so the player is probably at the ""baba"" tile.

Assuming the player is on the ""baba"" tile at 3 left, 3 down, then moving right would take them towards the walls. To get to the ""is"" at 2 left, 3 down, they need to move left. Wait, the ""rule is"" is at 2 left, 3 down, which is one step left from the player's assumed position.

If the player is on the ""baba"" tile (3 left, 3 down), moving left once would reach the ""is"" rule at 2 left, 3 down. Then, maybe move that ""is"" to combine with ""door"" and ""win.""

But the ""door"" rule is at 5 right, 3 down. That's quite far. Alternatively, the ""win"" rule is at 7 right, 3 up. Maybe combining ""win"" with ""door"" and ""is"" to make ""door is win.""

To do that, the player would need to move the ""is"" block next to ""door"" and ""win."" But moving from 2 left, 3 down to 5 right, 3 down is a long way, likely blocked by walls.

Alternatively, use the ""is"" at 6 right, 3 up. If the player can move up to that area, they could combine it with other rules. But again, path blocked by walls.

Wait, there's a ""rule is"" at 1 step right and 1 step down. If the player can get there, they could move that ""is"" block. Let's see: from the player's position (assuming 3 left, 3 down), moving right once gets to 2 left, 3 down, which is the ""rule is"" at 2 left, 3 down. Then moving right again to 1 left, 3 down, which is the ""rule you"" tile. But moving right from 2 left to 1 left would require passing through the ""rule you"" tile. If ""you"" is part of the active rule ""baba is you,"" then moving there is allowed because the player is Baba and can move over ""you.""

Once at the ""rule is"" at 2 left, 3 down, the player can pick it up and move it. Then, move it to the ""door"" rule at 5 right, 3 down. But that's a long distance. Alternatively, move the ""is"" next to the ""win"" rule at 7 right, 3 up. But again, path blocked.

Another idea: the ""key"" is 2 steps up. If the player can move up 2 steps, they can pick up the key. But there's a wall at 2 steps right and 2 steps up. So maybe they need to remove or change the wall's property.

The wall's rule is at 3 step left and 2 step up. If the player can move that ""wall is"" rule, they could change what a wall does. For example, making ""wall is push"" or ""wall is nothing."" But to move the ""wall"" rule, the player needs to be adjacent to it and move it. The ""wall"" rule is at 3 left, 2 up. From the player's position (3 left, 3 down), moving up two steps would reach 3 left, 1 down, then up to 3 left, 2 up, which is the ""wall"" rule. Then, move that rule to somewhere else.

If the player moves the ""wall is"" rule next to another rule, like ""stop is"" or ""you is,"" they could create a new rule. For example, moving ""wall is"" next to ""stop"" to make ""stop is wall,"" which would make stop blocks act as walls. Not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, moving the ""wall is"" rule to combine with ""baba"" to make ""baba is wall,"" but that would make the player a wall, which is probably not good.

Alternatively, the key is at 2 step up. If the player can make ""key is you,"" then picking up the key would make them the key. Then, if there's a rule that key can open the door, but the door is currently a ""stop."" If the player can change the door's rule to ""door is key,"" then stepping on the door as the key would win.

So steps could be:

1. Move to the key's position (2 step up) by navigating around walls. But blocked by walls. So need to change a wall's rule.

2. Alternatively, pick up the ""is"" rule and create a new rule like ""key is you.""

To do that, the player needs to get to the ""is"" rule. The closest ""is"" is at 2 left, 3 down. From the player's position (assuming 3 left, 3 down), moving left once reaches 2 left, 3 down, which is the ""is"" rule. Then pick it up and move it to the ""key"" rule at 6 right, 1 down. But that's a long way. Alternatively, move the ""is"" to near the ""key"" rule.

Alternatively, use the ""is"" at 6 right, 3 up. If the player can move right and up to reach there, but there are walls in the way.

Another approach: The ""rule you"" is at 1 left, 3 down. If the player can move the ""is"" next to ""you"" and ""door,"" creating ""door is you,"" then stepping on the door would make them win. But how?

Alternatively, make ""you is door,"" so the player (being you) becomes the door, and reaching the door would win.

But to do that, need to create ""you is door"" rule. The ""you"" is at 1 left, 3 down, and ""door"" is at 5 right, 3 down. The ""is"" is at 2 left, 3 down. So moving the ""is"" from 2 left, 3 down to between ""you"" and ""door.""

From the player's position (3 left, 3 down), move left to 2 left, 3 down (the ""is""), then left again to 1 left, 3 down (the ""you""). Then move the ""is"" to the right towards the ""door."" But there's a wall at 2 steps right and 3 down, so movement might be blocked.

This is getting complicated. Let's try to outline a step-by-step plan.

First, locate the player's position. Since the active rule is ""baba is you,"" and there's a ""rule baba"" at 3 left, 3 down, it's likely the player is on that tile.

So player's position: 3 left, 3 down.

Objective: Reach the door at 2 left, 2 steps down, which is a ""stop"" unless rules change.

Possible actions:

1. Move to the ""is"" rule at 2 left, 3 down (one step left from player's position).

2. Pick up that ""is"" rule and move it to near ""door"" and ""you"" to create ""door is you"" or ""you is door.""

For example:

- Move left to 2 left, 3 down (the ""is"").
- Then move right towards the ""you"" at 1 left, 3 down. But moving right from 2 left to 1 left is one step right.
- Place the ""is"" next to ""you"" and ""door."" But the ""door"" is at 5 right, 3 down, which is far away.

Alternatively, move the ""is"" to the ""door"" rule's location. But the path is blocked by walls.

Alternative idea: Use the ""key"" to unlock the door. If the door's rule can be changed to ""door is push"" or ""door is key,"" then the player can move it or open it.

To make ""door is key,"" need to create that rule. The ""key"" is at 6 right, 1 down. The ""door"" is at 5 right, 3 down. The ""is"" is at 6 right, 3 up. It's a bit far, but maybe possible.

Alternatively, move the ""is"" from 2 left, 3 down to near the ""key"" and ""door."" Let's see:

From player's position (3 left, 3 down):

- Move left to 2 left, 3 down (pick up ""is"").
- Move right to 1 left, 3 down (""you"" rule).
- Move right again to 0 left, 3 down (assuming that's possible, but there might be walls).
- Continue moving right until reaching the ""key"" at 6 right, 1 down. This seems impossible due to walls.

Alternative route:

- From 2 left, 3 down, move up to 2 left, 2 down.
- Then right to 3 left, 2 down (but there's a wall at 2 steps right and 2 steps up from the original position? Need to check the map again.

Looking back at the objects:

- wall 2 steps to the right and 3 step up (from player's position at 3 left, 3 down, that would be at 3 left -2 =1 left, 3 down +3=6 down? Wait, directions might be confusing. Let me clarify the coordinate system.

Assuming that ""steps to the right"" increases the x-coordinate, and ""steps up"" increases the y-coordinate. So the player's position is probably at (0,0), and other objects are positioned relative to that.

So:

- wall 2 steps to the right and 3 steps up: (2,3)
- rule `is` 6 steps to the right and 3 step up: (6,3)
- rule `win` 7 steps to the right and 3 step up: (7,3)
- rule `wall` 3 step to the left and 2 step up: (-3,2)
- rule `stop` 1 step to the left and 2 step up: (-1,2)
- key 2 step up: (0,2)
- wall 2 steps to the right and 2 step up: (2,2)
- wall 2 steps to the right and 1 step up: (2,1)
- wall 2 steps to the right: (2,0)
- rule `is` 1 step to the right and 1 step down: (1,-1)
- wall 2 steps to the right and 1 step down: (2,-1)
- rule `key` 6 steps to the right and 1 step down: (6,-1)
- door 2 step to the left and 2 steps down: (-2,-2)
- wall 2 steps to the right and 2 steps down: (2,-2)
- rule `baba` 3 step to the left and 3 steps down: (-3,-3)
- rule `is` 2 step to the left and 3 steps down: (-2,-3)
- rule `you` 1 step to the left and 3 steps down: (-1,-3)
- wall 2 steps to the right and 3 steps down: (2,-3)
- rule `door` 5 steps to the right and 3 steps down: (5,-3)

Now, the player's position is likely at the ""baba"" rule, which is at (-3,-3). So the player is at (-3,-3).

Active rule: baba is you, so the player can move and manipulate rules.

First, the key is at (0,2). To get there, the player needs to move up from (-3,-3) to (0,2). But the path is blocked by walls. Let's see:

From (-3,-3), moving right three steps to (0,-3), then up to (0,2). But along the way:

- At (0,-3), there's a wall (wall 2 steps to the right and 3 steps down from the original observation, which would be (2,-3), but maybe I'm getting confused. Wait, the walls are at various positions. Let's recheck:

The walls listed are:

- wall 2 steps to the right and 3 step up: (2,3)
- wall 2 steps to the right and 2 step up: (2,2)","

The problem is another Baba Is You level where I need to manipulate the rules. The active rule right now is ""baba is you,"" meaning I can move around as Baba. The goal is usually to reach the ""win"" object, but that might change.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key located 2 steps up. There are several walls blocking paths. To the left, there's a door at 2 steps left and 2 steps down. The ""win"" rule is 7 steps to the right and 3 steps up. But the path there is blocked by walls. 

I need to figure out how to reach the ""win"" object. Since the current rule is ""baba is you,"" I can move around. The key might be necessary to unlock the door. But where is the door? Let me check again: the door is at 2 steps left and 2 steps down. To get there, I might have to navigate around the walls.

Wait, there's a ""key"" at 2 steps up. To reach that key, I need to move up two steps. But looking at the map, there are walls to the right at those positions. For example, wall 2 steps to the right and 3 steps up, then another wall at 2 steps to the right and 2 steps up. So moving up directly might be blocked. Hmm, maybe I need to rearrange the rules to bypass the walls.

The ""is"" rule is at 6 steps to the right and 3 steps up. If I can move that ""is"" block, maybe I can create a new rule. But ""is"" rules are movable unless something makes them stop. Wait, there's a ""stop"" rule 1 step to the left and 2 step up. That might prevent moving some objects. But ""is"" is a rule, so maybe I can move it. Let me check the positions again.

The ""is"" block is 6 steps right and 3 up. If I move it, perhaps to create a rule like ""key is win,"" but I need the ""win"" rule. The ""win"" rule is already at 7 steps right and 3 up. Maybe I can combine these. Alternatively, if I can make ""baba"" have the ""key"" property, but that requires moving the ""key"" rule.

Another idea: The ""rule `baba`"" is at 3 steps left and 3 steps down. If I can move that ""baba"" rule and combine it with an ""is"" rule to make ""baba is win,"" then I would become the win condition. But how to get there? The path is blocked by walls. Maybe using the key to unlock the door first.

Wait, the door is at 2 left and 2 down. To reach the door, I need to move left twice and down twice. But the path might be blocked. Let me visualize the map. Starting from Baba's position (assuming standard starting point, but since the exact position isn't given, I have to go by the relative positions of objects).

Alternatively, maybe the key is more important. If I can pick up the key, then use it on the door. But how to pick up the key? In Baba Is You, you can push objects if they are not ""stop."" The key here is a regular object. The walls are ""stop,"" so I can move past them unless they're in the way. Wait, the rules are ""baba is you,"" so I can push objects that are not ""stop."" But the walls are defined as ""wall is stop"" (from the rule `wall` 3 step to the left and 2 step up). So the walls are stop, meaning I can't push past them. Therefore, to get to the key at 2 steps up, I need a path unblocked by walls.

Looking at the map, moving up two steps would require going through walls at 2 steps right and 3 up, 2 right and 2 up, etc. That's blocked. So maybe I need to rearrange the rules to make a path. For example, if I can change the ""wall"" rule to something else, like ""wall is push"" or ""wall is nothing,"" then I could move through them. But how?

The ""rule `wall`"" is at 3 steps left and 2 steps up. If I can move that ""wall"" rule and change its property. Let's see: there's an ""is"" rule at 6 steps right and 3 up. If I move that ""is"" to the position of the ""wall"" rule, then I can create a new rule. For example, move ""is"" to the ""wall"" rule's position, then create ""wall is [something]"". But I need the ""you"" or ""win"" rules nearby.

Alternatively, there's a ""rule `you`"" at 1 step left and 3 steps down. Maybe I can combine ""baba"" with ""is"" and ""you"" to make ""baba is you,"" but that's already the case. Wait, the current active rule is ""baba is you,"" so that's set.

Another angle: The door is a ""door"" object. To open it, you usually need a key. The key is at 2 steps up. So if I can get the key, then move to the door and use it. But how to reach the key? The path is blocked by walls. Unless I can make the walls not stop. Since walls are defined as ""wall is stop,"" if I can change that rule, then the walls wouldn't block me.

The ""rule `wall`"" is at 3 steps left and 2 steps up. If I can move that rule and change its property. For example, move the ""is"" rule to the ""wall"" rule's position, then make ""wall is push"" or something. But I need to have the ""is"" block available. The ""is"" block is at 6 steps right and 3 up. So I need to move that ""is"" block to the location of the ""wall"" rule.

But how to move the ""is"" block? Since ""is"" is a rule, and I'm Baba (you), I can push it unless it's stopped. The ""stop"" rule is at 1 step left and 2 step up. So to move the ""is"" block from 6 right, 3 up to 3 left, 2 up, I need a path. Let me calculate the direction. From 6 right, 3 up to 3 left, 2 up: that's moving left 9 steps and down 1 step. But the way is blocked by walls. For example, there's a wall at 2 steps right and 3 up, which is near the starting position. So it's probably impossible to move the ""is"" block that far left.

Hmm, maybe there's another way. What if I create a new rule that makes Baba able to move through walls? Like ""baba is push"" or ""baba is not stop."" But to do that, I need to manipulate existing rules. For example, take the ""is"" block and combine it with ""baba"" and ""not stop.""

The ""rule `baba`"" is at 3 steps left and 3 steps down. The ""is"" block is at 6 right, 3 up. The ""not stop"" isn't a rule here, but maybe I can create ""baba is push"" by moving the ""is"" next to ""baba"" and ""push."" But there's no ""push"" rule here. Alternatively, use ""win"" or ""key"" properties.

Wait, there's a ""rule `you`"" at 1 left, 3 down. If I can make ""baba is you"" into ""baba is win,"" then I would be the win condition. To do that, I need to move the ""is"" block next to ""baba"" and ""win."" The ""win"" rule is at 7 right, 3 up. The ""baba"" rule is at 3 left, 3 down. That's a big distance. Maybe not feasible.

Another idea: The door is at 2 left, 2 down. To get there, I need to move left twice and down twice. But the path might be blocked. Let's see. From Baba's position (unknown), but assuming standard, maybe the starting point is somewhere in the middle. The key is at 2 steps up, so maybe moving up first. But walls block that.

Wait, the ""key"" is at 2 steps up. If I can reach it, then take the key and use it on the door. But how? To get to the key, perhaps I need to move left and up. Let me check the positions again.

Alternatively, maybe the solution is to push the ""key"" rule to the door. The ""key"" rule is at 6 steps right, 1 step down. The door is at 2 left, 2 down. If I can move the ""key"" rule to the door's position, then maybe the door becomes key, which isn't helpful. Or maybe create ""door is key,"" allowing me to open it with Baba. But I need to have the ""key"" object nearby.

This is getting complicated. Let's recap the possible moves:

1. Move towards the key at 2 steps up, but blocked by walls.
2. Move the ""is"" rule to modify wall's property, making them passable.
3. Create a new rule that makes Baba able to move through walls or interact with the door.
4. Use the key to unlock the door by moving the key rule next to the door.

Option 2 seems promising. To change ""wall is stop"" to something else. The ""wall"" rule is at 3 left, 2 up. The ""is"" rule is at 6 right, 3 up. To move the ""is"" rule to the ""wall"" rule's position, I need a path. But the distance is too great, and walls are in the way.

Option 4: Get the key and move it to the door. The key is at 6 right, 1 down. The door is at 2 left, 2 down. To move the key, I need to push it if it's not stopped. The key's rule is at 6 right, 1 down. Since there's no rule making the key stop, I can push it. But the direction? From where?

Assuming I'm at the starting position, maybe to the right of the key. To push the key to the door, I need to move it left and down. But the door is to the left and down from the key's position. If I can push the key towards the door, then place it there. But how to do that step by step.

Alternatively, create a rule that makes key pushable or something. But not sure.

Wait, the ""rule `key`"" is at 6 right, 1 down. If I can move that rule next to the door, then maybe ""door is key"" would make the door passable when you have the key. But I need to first get the key object, which is separate from the rule.

This is tricky. Maybe the solution is to first get the key, then use it on the door. To get the key, I need to move up 2 steps, but the path is blocked by walls. Unless I can rearrange the rules to make the walls not stop.

Another angle: The ""rule `stop`"" is at 1 left, 2 up. Maybe I can move that rule to somewhere else, allowing me to move other objects. But how?

Alternatively, create a rule that makes ""baba"" immune to stop. For example, ""baba is not stop."" To do that, I need to use the ""is"" rule with ""baba"" and ""not stop."" But there's no ""not stop"" rule here. Unless I can negate the ""stop"" rule.

Wait, in Baba Is You, you can sometimes create negations by placing ""not"" before a property. But the available rules don't include ""not."" So maybe that's not possible here.

Alternatively, use the existing ""stop"" rule against itself. For example, ""stop is stop"" doesn't help. Hmm.

Maybe the key is a distraction. The real goal is to reach the ""win"" rule at 7 right, 3 up. To get there, I need to push past walls. If I can change the walls to be passable, that would work. But how?

The ""wall"" rule is at 3 left, 2 up. If I can move that rule to a different position and change its property. For example, move ""is"" to where ""wall"" is, then make ""wall is push"" or ""wall is you."" But again, the distance is an issue.

Wait, maybe there's a way to create a new rule that makes ""baba"" able to move through walls by redefining ""stop."" If I can make ""stop is you,"" then since Baba is you, stops would be you, meaning I can't push them, but maybe you can move through them. Not sure.

Alternatively, ""baba is win"" would make you the win condition, so you can just stand on the win rule. But how to create that rule. The ""win"" rule is at 7 right, 3 up. The ""baba"" rule is at 3 left, 3 down. The ""is"" rule is at 6 right, 3 up. So to create ""baba is win,"" I need to move ""is"" next to ""baba"" and ""win."" But the distance is too far.

This seems impossible. Maybe the intended solution is to push the ""win"" rule to where you are. For example, if you can move the ""win"" rule to your position, then you win. But ""win"" is a rule, and you can move it if it's not stopped. The ""win"" rule is at 7 right, 3 up. There's a wall at 2 right, 3 up, so you can't push past that.

Wait, the ""win"" rule is on the same horizontal line as the rightmost walls. So moving it left would require pushing through walls. But walls are stop, so you can't push them. So that's blocked.

Another possibility: The door at 2 left, 2 down. If you can make the door passable by redefining it. For example, ""door is you,"" so stepping on it would make you the you, which you already are. Not helpful. Or ""door is win,"" so stepping on it would win. But to create that rule, you need to move ""is"" next to ""door"" and ""win.""

The ""door"" rule is at 5 right, 3 down. The ""win"" rule is at 7 right, 3 up. The ""is"" rule is at 6 right, 3 up. So maybe move ""is"" down to the door's position and make ""door is win."" But how to get ""is"" there.

This is really challenging. Let me try to outline the steps:

1. Move to the ""is"" rule at 6 right, 3 up.
2. Push it towards the ""door"" rule at 5 right, 3 down.
3. Once ""is"" is next to ""door,"" create ""door is win.""
4. Then, move to the door, and since it's now win, stepping on it would win.

But to do this, I need to navigate to the ""is"" rule, which is 6 steps right and 3 up from wherever I am. Assuming I'm starting near the bottom left, this would require moving right and up, but the path is blocked by walls.

Alternatively, use the key to unlock the door. To do that, get the key at 2 up, push it to the door, and then the door can be opened. But again, reaching the key is blocked.

Wait, maybe the key is at 2 steps up. If I can move up two steps despite the walls, perhaps by changing the wall rules. For example, if I make ""wall is you,"" then since Baba is you, the walls would be you, and you can move through them. But how to create that rule.

The ""wall"" rule is at 3 left, 2 up. If I can move the ""is"" rule to there and make ""wall is you."" To do that, move ""is"" from 6 right, 3 up to 3 left, 2 up. That's a move left 9 and down 1. Impossible due to walls.

This is really stuck. Maybe the solution is to move the ""rule `you`"" at 1 left, 3 down and combine it with ""baba"" and ""is"" to make ""baba is you,"" but that's already the case.

Wait, the active rule is ""baba is you,"" so maybe I need to change the win condition. The ""win"" rule is at 7 right, 3 up. If I can make ""baba is win,"" then I would be the win. To do that, move ""is"" next to ""baba"" and ""win."" The ""baba"" rule is at 3 left, 3 down. The ""win"" rule is at 7 right, 3 up. The ""is"" rule is at 6 right, 3 up. So from ""is"" at 6 right, 3 up, move left to 5 right, then 4, etc., until next to ""baba"" at 3 left, 3 down. That's a huge distance. Not feasible.

Another angle: The door at 2 left, 2 down. If I can make the door passable by redefining it. For example, ""door is push"" or ""door is you."" If I make ""door is you,"" then stepping on it would make you the you, which you already are. Not helpful. If I make ""door is win,"" then stepping on it would win. But to do that, need to move ""is"" next to ""door"" and ""win.""

The ""door"" rule is at 5 right, 3 down. The ""win"" rule is at 7 right, 3 up. The ""is"" rule is at 6 right, 3 up. So move ""is"" down to 5 right, 3 down (door's position), then create ""door is win."" But how to move ""is"" there.

Alternatively, move ""is"" from 6 right, 3 up to 5 right, 3 down (one step down), but there's a wall at 2 right, 3 up, which is in the way. Not sure.

I think the key here is to realize that you need to pick up the key and use it on the door. To get the key, you might need to move the ""is"" rule to create a rule that allows you to move through walls. But without being able to reach the ""is"" rule, it's hard.

Wait, perhaps there's a different approach. Since the key is at 2 steps","

Let's see. I need to figure out how to solve this Baba Is You level. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I can move around, right? But there's a ""win"" rule somewhere, which is typically the goal. Looking at the objects, there's a ""key"" two steps up. Maybe I need to get that key to unlock a door?

First, I need to check where all the walls are. There are walls forming a sort of barrier to the right. The ""win"" rule is seven steps to the right and three steps up. That's probably the exit, but those walls are blocking the path. There's also a door to the left, two steps down, but I don't have the key yet. The key is two steps up, so maybe I should go get that first.

Wait, how do I move the key? The key is an object, and since ""baba is you,"" I can push other objects unless they're ""stop."" Let me check if any of the walls are marked ""stop."" Yes, there's a ""stop"" rule one step to the left and two steps up. That means I can't push past those walls. So moving the key might require rearranging the rules.

Looking at the rules, there's a ""rule `is`"" six steps to the right and three steps up. If I can move that ""is"" rule, maybe I can change another rule. For example, if I can move ""baba is you"" to make ""baba is win"" or something. But first, I need to reach the ""is"" rules to manipulate them.

The key is two steps up. From my current position (assuming I'm at the starting point, which isn't specified, but based on the walls, maybe the player is near the bottom left), moving up two steps would get me to the key. But the path is blocked by walls to the right. Wait, the walls two steps to the right and three steps up are there, but maybe there's a way around by moving left or down.

Wait, the key is two steps up directly. If I can move up twice. Let me visualize the layout. The key is two steps up. So from where I am, moving up once gets me to the first wall, but maybe there's a way to move left or right around it. But the walls are two steps to the right and three steps up. Hmm, maybe the key is in a different position. Let's parse the objects again.

The key is 2 step up. Wall 2 steps right and 3 step up. So the key is directly above me, but there's a wall two steps to the right and three up. Wait, maybe my position is somewhere central. Let me try to sketch this mentally.

Assuming the player is somewhere in the middle. To the left are some rules: ""baba is you,"" ""is,"" ""you,"" etc., three steps to the left and three steps down. The key is two steps up. So moving up two steps from my current position would reach the key. But the path is blocked by walls two steps to the right. So maybe I need to move left to avoid the walls.

Alternatively, maybe I can push the key past the walls. But the walls are stoppable. Since ""baba is you,"" I can move objects unless they're stop. The walls are defined by the ""wall is stop"" rule. Wait, the active rules include ""baba is you,"" but there's a ""rule `wall` 3 step to the left and 2 step up."" So that wall is defined by a rule, meaning it's not necessarily an immovable wall. Wait, no, the ""wall"" objects are on the map, and the rules define their properties. The ""wall is stop"" rule would make walls act as stoppers. So if I can change that rule, maybe walls aren't stop anymore.

But right now, the active rules are just ""baba is you."" The other rules are ""wall is stop"" and ""stop"" is a rule. So the walls are stoppable. Therefore, I can't push them. So moving the key towards the door might require moving past these walls, but I can't push them. So maybe I need to rearrange the rules to make walls not stop.

Looking at the rules, there's a ""rule `wall` 3 step to the left and 2 step up."" If I can move that ""wall"" rule and replace it with something else, maybe I can remove the ""wall is stop"" property. Alternatively, create a rule that says ""wall is push"" or something.

But first, I need to get to the ""is"" rules. The ""rule `is`"" is six steps to the right and three steps up. That's quite far. Maybe there's a closer ""is"" rule. There's another ""rule `is`"" at 1 step right and 1 step down. That's closer. If I can move that ""is"" rule, maybe I can create a new rule.

Wait, but how do I pick up the ""is"" rule? Since ""baba is you,"" I can move any object that isn't stop. The ""is"" rule itself is an object. Are there any rules that make ""is"" stop? No, the only stop rules are the ""stop"" object and the ""wall is stop"" rule. So ""is"" rules can be moved.

So maybe the plan is: move the ""is"" rule from 1 step right and 1 step down to somewhere else to create a new rule. For example, move it to combine with ""baba"" to make ""baba is win"" or something. But I need to reach that ""is"" rule first.

Alternatively, the key is two steps up. If I can move the key to the door, which is two steps left and two steps down. But to do that, I need to avoid the walls. The path to the door is blocked by walls to the right. So maybe I need to make the walls not stop by changing their rules.

Another approach: Since ""baba is you,"" I can become other objects by changing the rules. For example, if I create ""baba is key,"" then I could pick up the key. But how? I need to create that rule by moving text blocks.

Looking at the available rules: there's a ""rule `key`"" at 6 steps right and 1 step down. If I can move that ""key"" rule and combine it with a ""baba"" rule. The ""rule `baba`"" is three steps left and three steps down. So maybe move the ""baba"" rule closer and combine it with ""is"" and ""key"" to make ""baba is key.""

But to do that, I need to move those rules. Let's see. The ""baba"" rule is three steps left and three steps down from the current position (assuming I'm at the starting point near the ""baba is you"" rule). So moving left three steps and down three steps to reach the ""baba"" rule. Then move the ""is"" rule from 1 step right and 1 step down, and the ""key"" rule from 6 steps right and 1 step down. That seems complicated.

Alternatively, maybe the key is there to unlock the door. So get the key, then use it on the door. But the door is two steps left and two steps down. To get to the door, I need to move left and down, but there are walls in the way. The wall two steps to the right and three steps up is blocking the upper path. Maybe I need to rearrange the rules to remove those walls.

Wait, the ""wall is stop"" rule is at 3 steps left and 2 steps up. If I can move that rule, maybe I can delete it or change it. But to move that rule, I need to be able to pick it up. Since it's a rule object, and there's no ""stop"" on it, I can move it.

So the plan could be: move the ""wall is stop"" rule out of the way, thereby making walls not stop. Then proceed past them. But how to do that? Let's see. The ""wall is stop"" rule is at 3 steps left and 2 steps up. If I can move that rule to a different location, maybe delete it by moving it off the grid, or replace it with another rule.

Alternatively, create a new rule that says ""stop is nothing"" or something. But that's more complex.

Alternatively, use the ""is"" rule to create a new rule. For example, take the ""is"" rule at 6 steps right and 3 steps up, move it to combine with ""wall"" and ""no"" or something. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the key is two steps up. Let's prioritize getting the key. To reach the key, I need to move up two steps. But there's a wall two steps to the right and three steps up. So if I move left from my current position, maybe I can go around. But how?

Alternatively, if I can make the walls not stop, then I can push them. But to do that, I need to rearrange the ""wall is stop"" rule.

So step by step:

1. Move to the ""wall is stop"" rule at 3 steps left and 2 steps up.
2. Pick it up (since it's a rule and not stop) and move it away.
3. Now, walls are no longer stop, so I can push them out of the way.
4. Then proceed to the key, take it, and use it on the door.

But how do I move the ""wall is stop"" rule? Let's think about my current position. Assume I'm at the position where ""baba is you"" is located. Let's say that's at (0,0). Then:

- ""wall is stop"" is at (-3, 2) (3 steps left, 2 steps up).
- The key is at (0, 2) (2 steps up).
- The door is at (-2, -2) (2 steps left, 2 steps down).

To reach the ""wall is stop"" rule at (-3, 2), I need to move left three times and up two times. But the path might be blocked. Let's see the walls:

- There's a wall at (2, 3) (2 steps right, 3 steps up).
- Other walls to the right block the upper path.

So moving left to (-3, 2) might be possible if there are no walls in the way. Let's check the objects:

Looking at the objects list, the walls are at specific positions. For example:

- wall 2 steps to the right and 3 step up: (2,3)
- wall 2 steps to the right and 2 step up: (2,2)
- wall 2 steps to the right and 1 step up: (2,1)
- wall 2 steps to the right: (2,0)
- wall 2 steps to the right and 1 step down: (2,-1)
- etc.

So moving left from (0,0) to (-3,2) would pass through positions that might have other rules or objects. The ""rule `baba`"" is at (-3, -3), ""rule `is`"" at (-2, -3), ""rule `you`"" at (-1, -3). So those are rules, not walls. The ""stop"" rule is at (-1, 2). The ""wall is stop"" rule is at (-3, 2).

So moving left three steps from (0,0) to (-3,0), then up two steps to (-3,2). Along the way, are there any walls? The walls are all to the right (positive x direction), so moving left shouldn't encounter walls. Therefore, it's possible to reach (-3,2).

Once there, pick up the ""wall is stop"" rule and move it somewhere. For example, move it down to (-3, -3), which is where the ""baba"" rule is. But that might not help. Alternatively, move it off the grid, but the game probably has boundaries.

Alternatively, create a new rule that says ""stop is"" something else. For example, move the ""is"" rule from (6,3) to combine with ""stop"" and ""nothing"". But that's complicated.

Alternatively, use the ""is"" rule from (1, -1) to create a new rule. For example, move ""is"" to (-3,2) where the ""wall is stop"" rule is, and then arrange them as ""wall is not stop"" or something. But I need to see how the rules are structured.

The existing ""wall is stop"" rule is at (-3,2). If I can replace ""stop"" with something else using the ""is"" rule. So, take the ""is"" rule from (1,-1), move it to (-3,2), and then attach it to ""wall"" and a new property. For example, ""wall is push"" or ""wall is you"".

But this requires moving multiple objects. First, move the ""is"" rule from (1,-1) to (-3,2). Then, take the ""wall"" rule from somewhere (like the ""rule `wall`"" at (-3,2) itself?) and combine them.

This is getting a bit complicated. Maybe a simpler approach: get the key first.

To get the key at (0,2), I need to move up two steps. But the path is blocked by walls to the right. However, if I can make the walls not stop, then I can move around them. So first, remove the ""wall is stop"" rule.

So step by step:

1. Move to the ""wall is stop"" rule at (-3,2).
2. Pick it up (since it's a rule and not stop) and move it to a different position, say, drop it at (-3, -3) where the ""baba"" rule is.
3. Now, the rule ""wall is stop"" is no longer active, so walls are not stoppable. I can push them.
4. Move up two steps to get the key at (0,2).
5. Then, move left to the door at (-2,-2), using the key to unlock it.

Alternatively, after removing the ""wall is stop"" rule, I can push the walls aside to reach the key. But since the key is directly up, maybe I can just move up past the walls because they're no longer stop.

Wait, if walls are no longer stop, then moving into them would just push them, right? So from (0,0), move up to (0,1), which is a wall at (2,1). But if walls are not stop, I can push them. So push the wall at (2,1) out of the way by moving left or right. But that might require positioning.

This is getting too vague. Let's try to outline specific actions.

First, navigate to the ""wall is stop"" rule at (-3,2). To do that from (0,0):

- Move left 3 times: left, left, left.
- Move up 2 times: up, up.

Now, at (-3,2), pick up the ""wall is stop"" rule. Since it's a rule, and there's no ""stop"" on it, I can move it. Let's move it down to (-3, -3), which is where the ""baba"" rule is. So:

- Down 5 times: down, down, down, down, down.

Now, the ""wall is stop"" rule is moved off the relevant area, so walls are no longer stop. Now, I can move through them.

Next, go get the key at (0,2). From (-3,-3), move right 3 times and up 2 times:

- Right, right, right.
- Up, up.

Now at (0,2), which is the key's position. Pick up the key (since ""baba is you"" and key is an object).

Now, move to the door at (-2,-2). From (0,2):

- Left 2 times.
- Down 2 times.

But the path might have walls. However, since walls are no longer stop, I can push them out of the way. For example, if there's a wall at (2,3), but I'm moving left, so that's not in the path. The door is at (-2,-2), so moving left 2 and down 2 should be clear.

At the door, which is a ""rule `door`"" at (-2,-2), but the actual door object is at (-2,-2). To unlock it, I need to have the key. Since I have the key, maybe the rule ""door is lock"" exists, and by having the key, I can change that. Alternatively, the door could be a ""win"" condition if I can make ""door is win"".

But the active rule is still ""baba is you"". The ""win"" rule is at (7,3). So maybe after reaching the door, I need to change the rule to make interacting with the door a win.

Alternatively, the door's rule is ""door is win"" somewhere. Looking at the objects, there's a ""rule `door`"" at (5,3). So if I can move that ""door"" rule and combine it with ""win"" and ""is"", I can make ""door is win"".

So steps after getting the key:

1. Go to the ""rule `door`"" at (5,3).
2. Pick it up and move it to combine with ""win"" rule at (7,3) and ""is"" rule at (6,3).

But this requires moving multiple objects. Alternatively, create a new rule ""door is win"" by moving ""is"" from (6,3) to between ""door"" and ""win"".

So from (0,2) with the key, move to (5,3):

- Right 5 times.
- Down 1 time.

At (5,3), which is the ""door"" rule. Pick it up and move left to (6,3), which is the ""is"" rule. Place the ""door"" rule next to ""is"" and ""win"" to form ""door is win"".

Once that's done, the door would be the win condition. Then, go to the door at (-2,-2) and touch it to win.

But this is quite involved. Let's try to break it down into actions.

First, remove the ""wall is stop"" rule:

1. Move left 3, up 2 to reach (-3,2).
2. Pick up ""wall is stop"" and move down 5 to (-3,-3).

Then get the key:

3. Move right 3, up 2 to (0,2).
4. Pick up key.

Then create ""door is win"":

5. Move right 5, down 1 to (5,3) (door rule).
6. Move left to (4,3), place door rule.
7. Move left to (6","

I need to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. The active rule right now is ""baba is you,"" which means I can move Baba. The goal is usually to reach the ""win"" object, but I should check if there are any other rules that might change that.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key two steps up. Maybe I need to get the key to unlock a door? There's a door located two steps to the left and two steps down. But how do I get there? The path is blocked by walls. Also, there's a ""rule `win`"" seven steps to the right and three steps up. That might be the target, but accessing it seems tricky.

First, let me note all the positions:

- The player (Baba) is at the starting position, probably where the initial ""baba is you"" rule is. Let me assume that's the center, but the exact position isn't specified. The walls are arranged in a pattern. To the right, there are walls forming a barrier three steps up, two up, one up, and then the floor. Down, there's a rule `is` blocking movement to the right, and a wall below that. To the left, there's a wall and a ""stop"" rule near the top, which might make those areas impassable unless I change the rules.

The key is two steps up. If I can move up there, maybe I can pick up the key and use it on the door. But how do I get past the walls blocking the path? The walls to the right are three in a column. Maybe I can create a new rule to turn those walls into something I can walk through. For example, if I can move the ""rule `wall`"" that's three steps left and two steps up, maybe I can rearrange the rules to change the behavior of walls.

Wait, the rules are on the map as objects. The ""rule `is`"" blocks are movable unless they're under a ""stop"" property. The ""stop"" rule is one step left and two steps up. So anything under ""stop"" can't be moved. But the ""rule `wall`"" three steps left and two steps up might be movable. If I can move that rule, maybe I can replace it with something else. For example, if I make ""baba is win,"" then touching the win object would make me win. But I need to do that by moving the text blocks.

Alternatively, the door is two steps left and two steps down. There's a ""rule `door`"" five steps to the right and three steps down. If I can change ""door is stop"" to something else, like ""door is push"" or ""door is you,"" maybe I can interact with it differently. But first, I need to get to that door.

The key is two steps up. Let me check if there's a way to reach it. The path to the key is blocked by walls two steps to the right and two, one, and three steps up. Wait, maybe I can use the ""rule `is`"" that's six steps to the right and three steps up. If I can move that ""is"" block somewhere else, maybe I can create a new rule. For example, moving ""is"" next to ""key"" and ""baba"" to make ""baba is key,"" but I don't know if that helps. Alternatively, moving ""is"" to create ""key is you,"" so I can push the key.

But first, I need to move the ""rule `is`"" blocks. Let's see. The player (Baba) is at the starting position. Let's assume I'm positioned somewhere central. To move up to the key, I need to navigate past the walls on the right. The walls are two steps to the right and three, two, one steps up. So if I move left, maybe there's a path. There's a ""stop"" rule one step left and two steps up, which is part of the immovable objects. So moving left past that might be blocked.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the ""rule `is`"" that's one step right and one step down. If I can move that ""is"" block up to where the key is, maybe I can create a new rule. For example, moving ""is"" next to ""key"" and ""you"" to make ""key is you,"" allowing me to pick up the key. But how do I move the ""is"" block?

To move a text block, I need to be adjacent to it and not be stopped by any ""stop"" properties. The ""rule `is`"" at 6 steps right and 3 up is probably far away. Maybe I should look for closer movable objects. The ""rule `is`"" at 1 step right and 1 down is closer. If I can get to that position, I can move it.

So, possible steps:

1. Move right to get to the ""rule `is`"" block at 1 step right and 1 down.
2. Use that ""is"" block to create a new rule. For example, move it to the key's position (2 steps up) and combine it with ""key"" and ""win"" or ""you"".
3. If I can make ""key is you,"" then I can pick up the key by touching it.
4. Then, take the key to the door and use it to unlock it, changing ""door is stop"" to something else.

But how do I navigate to the key? The path to the key is blocked by walls on the right. The walls are at 2 steps right and 3, 2, 1 up. So to get to the key at 2 steps up, which is directly above the starting position, I need to move up, but the wall at 2 steps right and 2 up is in the way. Unless I can remove that wall's rule.

The ""rule `wall`"" is at 3 steps left and 2 steps up. If I can move that rule, I could change the definition of wall. For example, moving it to become ""wall is push"" or something, making walls passable. But to do that, I need to move the ""rule `wall`"" block.

But how do I reach that ""rule `wall`"" block? It's 3 steps left and 2 steps up. From the starting position, moving left three steps and up two would get there, but there's a ""stop"" rule at 1 step left and 2 steps up, which is part of the immovable objects. So moving left past that is blocked.

This is tricky. Maybe another approach. Since ""baba is you,"" I can push objects that aren't stopped. The ""rule `is`"" blocks aren't stopped unless they're under a ""stop"" rule. The ""stop"" rule is at 1 step left and 2 steps up. So the ""rule `is`"" at 6 steps right and 3 up is movable. But that's far away.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule by combining existing ones. For example, move the ""rule `is`"" from 6 steps right and 3 up next to ""baba"" and ""win"" to make ""baba is win,"" making Baba itself the win condition. But that would require moving the ""is"" block, which is six steps away. That's a lot of moves, and I might not have enough steps.

Wait, the other ""is"" block at 1 step right and 1 down is closer. If I can move that ""is"" block to be next to ""baba"" and ""win,"" that would create ""baba is win."" Let's see:

Current position of ""rule `is`"": 1 step right, 1 down. The ""win"" rule is 7 steps right and 3 up. That's a long distance. Maybe not feasible.

Alternatively, move the ""is"" block to next to ""key"" and ""you"" to make ""key is you."" Then, I can push the key. Let's see where the key is: 2 steps up. The ""rule `is`"" at 1 step right, 1 down. If I move down to the key's position, but the path is blocked by walls on the right.

Wait, maybe I can move left past the stop rule. The ""stop"" is at 1 step left and 2 steps up. If I can move left from the starting position, but there's a wall at 2 steps right and 3 up. Wait, maybe the player's starting position is somewhere in the middle. Let me try to visualize the map.

Assuming the player is at position (0,0). Then:

- Wall at (2,3)
- rule `is` at (6,3)
- rule `win` at (7,3)
- rule `wall` at (-3,2) (3 steps left, 2 up)
- rule `stop` at (-1,2) (1 step left, 2 up)
- key at (0,2)
- walls at (2,2), (2,1), (2,0)
- rule `is` at (1, -1)
- wall at (2, -1)
- rule `key` at (6, -1)
- door at (-2, -2)
- walls at (2, -2)
- rule `baba` at (-3, -3)
- rule `is` at (-2, -3)
- rule `you` at (-1, -3)
- wall at (2, -3)
- rule `door` at (5, -3)

This is a rough mental map. The player (Baba) is at (0,0). To get to the key at (0,2), there's a wall at (2,2), (2,1), (2,0). So moving right is blocked. Moving left, past (-1,2) which is a stop, so can't go there. Up, to (0,2), but the path is blocked by walls on the right. Alternatively, maybe move the ""rule `wall`"" at (-3,2) to change the definition of walls. If I can make walls pushable or remove them.

To move the ""rule `wall`"" at (-3,2), I need to be adjacent to it. The player is at (0,0). The distance is 3 left and 2 up. That's too far to push unless there's a way to move closer.

Alternatively, use another ""is"" block to create a new rule. For example, use the ""rule `is`"" at (6,3) which is 6 right and 3 up. That's even farther.

Wait, there's a ""rule `is`"" at (1, -1). If I can get to that position, maybe I can move it. From (0,0), moving right 1 and down 1 gets to (1,-1), which is the ""rule `is`"". Then, from there, perhaps move it to adjacent objects.

If I move the ""rule `is`"" from (1,-1) to (0,-1), which is next to the key at (0,2)? No, that's not adjacent. Maybe move it up to (1,0) to create a new rule.

Alternatively, move the ""is"" block to (0,2) next to the key. For example, move the ""is"" from (1,-1) to (0,-1), then up to (0,0), then to (0,1), then to (0,2). Then combine it with ""key"" and ""you"" to make ""key is you"". That way, I can push the key.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Move right once to (1,0) to get to the ""rule `is`"" at (1,-1). Wait, no, the ""rule `is`"" is at (1,-1), which is one step right and one step down from the starting position (0,0). So to reach it, move right then down.

Wait, movement is step by step. From (0,0):

- Move right to (1,0)
- Move down to (1,-1) to pick up the ""rule `is`"" block.

Once I have the ""rule `is`"" block, I can move it around.

Next, move the ""is"" block to the key's location (0,2). The path would be:

From (1,-1):

- Move left to (0,-1)
- Move up to (0,0)
- Move up again to (0,1)
- Move up again to (0,2)

Now, at (0,2) with the ""rule `is`"" block. The key is at (0,2). So place the ""is"" next to the key and create a rule ""key is you"". To do that, move the ""is"" block to be adjacent to ""key"" and ""you"". But where is ""you"" located?

Looking at the objects, there's a ""rule `you`"" at (-1, -3). That's three steps left and three steps down. Too far.

Alternatively, create ""you"" as a new rule. Since the active rule is ""baba is you"", maybe I can make Baba into something else. But I need to create a new rule.

Alternatively, use the ""rule `is`"" block at (0,2) next to the key and maybe the player (Baba) to make ""key is you"". Wait, the player is at (0,2) with the ""is"" block. So if I place the ""is"" block next to ""key"" and ""Baba"", it would create ""key is you"" because Baba is the player and ""you"" is the subject.

So, steps:

1. Move right to (1,0), then down to (1,-1) to get the ""rule `is`"".
2. Move left to (0,-1), up to (0,0), up to (0,1), up to (0,2) with the ""is"" block.
3. Now, at (0,2) with ""is"", next to the key. Since I'm Baba (baba is you), placing the ""is"" block next to key and me would create ""key is you"".
4. Then, I can push the key by moving towards it, as it's now ""you"".

Once I have the key, go to the door at (-2, -2). To get there, need to navigate through the map. There's a wall at (2,-2), but the door is at (-2,-2). The path might require moving around the walls.

Alternatively, change the door's rule. The ""rule `door`"" is at (5,-3). If I can move that to make ""door is win"", then touching the door would make me win. But that's a long way.

Alternatively, use the key on the door. If the door is a lock, maybe the key opens it. But in Baba Is You, usually, you need to push the key to the door and then the door might become passable if the rule is ""door is win"" or similar.

This is getting complicated. Let's focus on getting the key first.

After making ""key is you"", I can move the key by pushing it. Since I'm you (because ""baba is you"" and ""key is you""), I can move the key. The key is at (0,2). To get to the door at (-2,-2), I need to move left and down.

But the path is blocked by walls. For example, from (0,2), moving left would go to (-1,2), but there's a ""stop"" rule at (-1,2), so that's blocked. Alternatively, move down to (0,1), then left to (-1,1), but again, walls and stops might be in the way.

Alternatively, use the ""rule `is`"" blocks to create new rules that allow movement through walls. For example, create ""wall is push"" so I can push walls out of the way. To do that, find a ""rule `wall`"" and move it.

The ""rule `wall`"" is at (-3,2). To reach there, I need to move left three steps and up two, but the ""stop"" at (-1,2) blocks the path. Unless I can remove the ""stop"" rule.

The ""rule `stop`"" is at (-1,2). To move it, I need to be adjacent and not stopped. If I can create a rule that removes the ""stop"" property, like ""stop is nothing"" or something. But I don't have a ""nothing"" rule.

Alternatively, push the ""rule `stop`"" block. Since it's a ""stop"" rule, and unless it's under another stop, can I move it? The ""rule `stop`"" at (-1,2) is a stop, so anything trying to move into it or adjacent might be blocked. But since I'm Baba and ""baba is you"", and ""you"" can push objects unless they're stopped. Wait, ""stop"" is a property that makes objects immovable. So the ""rule `stop`"" itself is a text block that, if present, makes the object it's applied to immovable.

So the ""rule `stop`"" at (-1,2) is applying the stop property to whatever it's next to. Looking at the objects, there's a wall at (-3,2) which is three steps left and two up. Wait, maybe the ""rule `stop`"" is applied to the wall at (-3,2). Because the wall is at (-3,2), and the ""rule `stop`"" is at (-1,2). That's two steps apart, so they're not adjacent. So maybe the ""rule `stop`"" isn't applied to any object, making it a separate rule.

If that's the case, then the ""rule `stop`"" can be moved. Since it's not applying any stop property, it's just a text block saying ""stop"". To move it, I need to be adjacent to it. From the starting position, moving left to (-1,2) is blocked by the ""stop"" rule. Wait, but if the ""rule `stop`"" is at (-1,2), then moving into that tile would be stopped. So I can't get to (-1,2) to pick up the ""rule `stop`"" block.

This is really challenging. Maybe another approach: use the ""rule `is`"" block at (6,3) which is six steps right and three up. That's the farthest one, but perhaps I can move it somewhere useful.

To reach (6,3), I'd need to move right six times and up three, but the path is blocked by walls on the right. Unless I can change the walls to be pushable.

Alternatively, create a rule that makes ""rule is win"", allowing me to win by touching a rule block. But that seems unlikely.

Wait, the active rule is ""baba","

Let's see. I need to figure out how to proceed in this Baba Is You level. The current rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I can move Baba. The goal is usually to reach a ""win"" object, but maybe I can change that. Let me look at the objects on the map.

First, there's a key located 2 steps up. Maybe I need to get that key to unlock a door? Then there's a door 2 steps to the left and 2 steps down. But right now, the door is probably acting as a ""stop"" because the active rules don't mention it being passable. Wait, looking at the active rules, the only rules are ""baba is you."" All other rules are text blocks on the map that I can potentially rearrange.

So, the key is 2 steps up. Let me check where Baba is located. The observation doesn't explicitly state Baba's position, but since the active rule is ""baba is you,"" I must be on a Baba tile. Let's assume I'm starting at the position of the ""baba"" rule tile, which is 3 steps to the left and 3 steps down from some reference point. Wait, maybe the map's layout needs to be visualized.

Looking at the objects:

- The ""rule `is`"" is at 6 steps right, 3 up. That's probably near the top right corner.
- The ""win"" rule is to the right of that, at 7 steps right, 3 up. So the top right has the ""is"", ""win"", and ""wall"" rules.
- There's a key at 2 steps up. Maybe that's near the top middle?
- Walls are forming a path. There are walls to the right at various positions, creating a barrier.
- The door is 2 steps left and 2 down, which might be in the lower left area.
- The ""rule `baba`"", ""rule `is`"", and ""rule `you`"" are at 3 left, 3 down; 2 left, 3 down; and 1 left, 3 down. So those are on the lower left side.

To reach the ""win"" object, which is at 7 steps right, 3 up, I need to get past the walls. But currently, moving right is blocked by walls. The key at 2 steps up might be a way to unlock the door. However, the door is a ""stop"" unless its rule is changed. The door has a ""rule `door`"" at 5 steps right, 3 down. So if I can change ""door is stop"" to something else, like ""door is pass"" or ""door is you"", maybe I can go through it.

But first, I need to get the key. The key is 2 steps up. If I move up twice, I can pick up the key. Let me check if the path is clear. Looking at the objects above: wall 2 steps right and 3 up, then rule `is` at 6 right, 3 up. So moving up from my current position (assuming I'm near the lower left), moving up twice would take me to the key's position. But wait, the key is 2 steps up. So if I'm at the same horizontal level, moving up twice would get me there. However, there's a wall 2 steps to the right and 2 steps up. Wait, no—the walls are at various positions. Let's clarify:

The walls listed are:

- 2 right, 3 up
- 2 right, 2 up
- 2 right, 1 up
- 2 right (assuming that's 2 right, 0 down)
- 2 right, 1 down
- 2 right, 2 down
- 2 right, 3 down

So the right side is blocked by walls from up to down. The left side has rules for baba, is, and you. The key is at 2 steps up. So maybe the path to the key is blocked by walls on the right, but perhaps there's a gap on the left.

Assuming I'm starting at the position of the ""baba"" rule (3 left, 3 down), to get to the key at 2 up, I need to move up twice. But there's a wall at 3 step left and 2 step up (rule `wall` 3 step to the left and 2 step up). Wait, that's a rule that says ""wall is..."" So if there's a wall tile at 3 left, 2 up, moving left from my starting position (3 left, 3 down) to 3 left, 2 up would hit that wall. But perhaps I can move up first.

Wait, maybe my position is not specified, so I need to infer. Let's try to map out the grid.

Let's assume the reference point is the position of the ""rule `baba`"" at 3 steps left and 3 steps down. So if I'm at that position (3 left, 3 down), then:

- Moving up 2 steps would bring me to (3 left, 1 down).
- The key is at 2 step up, which would be (3 left, 1 down)? Wait, the key's position is ""2 step up,"" so from my current position (3 left, 3 down), moving up 2 steps would place me at (3 left, 1 down). But there's a wall at 2 steps right and 1 step up. Wait, the walls are at various positions relative to the reference point.

This is getting a bit confusing without a visual map. Let's try to list all objects relative to the reference point (assuming the ""rule `baba`"" is at 0,0 for simplicity):

- rule `baba` is at (3 left, 3 down) → (-3, 3)
- rule `is` at (2 left, 3 down) → (-2, 3)
- rule `you` at (1 left, 3 down) → (-1, 3)
- wall at (2 right, 3 up) → (2, -3)
- rule `win` at (7 right, 3 up) → (7, -3)
- rule `is` at (6 right, 3 up) → (6, -3)
- key at (2 up) → (0, -2)
- wall at (2 right, 2 up) → (2, -2)
- wall at (2 right, 1 up) → (2, -1)
- wall at (2 right) → (2, 0)
- rule `is` at (1 right, 1 down) → (1, 1)
- wall at (2 right, 1 down) → (2, 1)
- rule `key` at (6 right, 1 down) → (6, 1)
- door at (2 left, 2 down) → (-2, 2)
- wall at (2 right, 2 down) → (2, 2)
- rule `door` at (5 right, 3 down) → (5, -3)

This is a rough mapping. Now, if I'm at the ""baba"" rule position (-3,3), which is also my starting position since ""baba is you"", I need to move.

The key is at (0, -2), which is 3 steps left and 2 steps down from my current position. But there's a wall at (2, -2) (2 right, 2 up from reference), which might block the path. Wait, the key is at (0, -2), so directly below the reference point. To get there, I need to move left 3 steps and down 2 steps. However, the path might be blocked by walls on the right.

Looking at the walls:

- Right side has walls from up to down: at (2, -3), (2, -2), (2, -1), (2, 0), (2, 2). So the right side is fully blocked except maybe at (2,1) which is a wall but maybe a different position.

The left side has rules at (-3,3), (-2,3), (-1,3). The door is at (-2,2). So perhaps the path to the key is through the left side.

From my starting position (-3,3), moving left to (-4,3) isn't possible because there's no info on that. Alternatively, moving down to (-3,2), then left to (-4,2), etc., but need to avoid walls.

Alternatively, moving down to (-3,2), then left to (-4,2), then down to (-4,1), etc. But without knowing the layout beyond the given objects, it's tricky.

Alternatively, maybe the key is reachable by moving up first. The key is at (0, -2), which is two steps down from the reference point. If I can move down from (-3,3) to (-3,2), then (-3,1), then left to (-4,1), etc., but there's a wall at (2, -2) which is the top right.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is at 2 steps up from my current position. If I'm at (-3,3), moving up two steps would be (-3,1), but the key is at (0,-2), which is not in the same vertical line. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the directions.

The problem is that the directions are relative. For example, ""wall 2 steps to the right and 3 step up"" means from the reference point (assuming it's the position of the ""baba"" rule), the wall is 2 right and 3 up.

This is getting complicated. Let me try to sketch a possible grid:

Assuming the reference point (Baba's rule) is at (0,0):

- Up is negative Y, Down is positive Y.
- Right is positive X, Left is negative X.

So:

- rule `baba` is at (-3, 3)
- rule `is` at (-2, 3)
- rule `you` at (-1, 3)
- wall at (2, -3)
- rule `win` at (7, -3)
- rule `is` at (6, -3)
- key at (0, -2)
- wall at (2, -2)
- wall at (2, -1)
- wall at (2, 0)
- rule `is` at (1, 1)
- wall at (2, 1)
- rule `key` at (6, 1)
- door at (-2, 2)
- wall at (2, 2)
- rule `door` at (5, -3)

Now, my position is at (-3,3) because that's where the ""baba"" rule is, and since ""baba is you"", I can move there.

To get to the key at (0,-2), I need to move from (-3,3) to (0,-2). The path would be:

1. Move down from (-3,3) to (-3,2), (-3,1), (-3,0), (-3,-1), (-3,-2). But check if there are walls along the way.

Looking at the walls:

- At (2, -3), (2, -2), (2, -1), (2, 0), (2, 2) on the right side.
- On the left side, walls are not mentioned except for the ones creating the structure.

If I move straight down from (-3,3), I would pass through (-3,2), (-3,1), etc., which don't have walls mentioned, so that's probably clear.

Once I reach (-3,-2), that's the key's position. Then pick up the key. But how do I pick up the key? In Baba Is You, to pick up a key, you need to be on the same tile as the key and then move away, but sometimes you have to push it. Alternatively, if the key is on a separate tile, you might need to move onto it.

Assuming the key is on a separate tile, I need to move to (0,-2). Wait, no— the key's position is ""2 step up"" from the reference point. If the reference point is (0,0), then ""2 step up"" is (0, -2). So from my current position (-3,3), moving right 3 steps and down 5 steps to get to (0,-2). That's a long way around the right side, which is blocked by walls. Alternatively, moving left along the bottom.

But moving left from (-3,3) to (-4,3), etc., but there's no info on what's beyond the existing objects. It's possible that moving left along the bottom is clear.

So possible steps:

1. Move down from (-3,3) to (-3,2), (-3,1), (-3,0), (-3,-1), (-3,-2) to reach the key. But need to confirm there are no walls in between.

The walls on the right side are at (2, -3) to (2,2), but on the left, the path from (-3,3) down to (-3,-2) seems clear as no walls are mentioned there.

So moving down five steps to (-3,-2) to get the key.

Once I have the key, I can go to the door at (-2,2). The door is a ""stop"" unless its rule is changed. The rule for door is at (5,-3): ""rule `door` 5 steps to the right and 3 steps down"" from the reference point, which is (5, -3). To change the door's property, I need to move the ""door"" text block and combine it with a ""stop"" or ""pass"" text block.

But to do that, I need to reach the rule `door` at (5,-3). From my position at (0,-2) after getting the key, moving right to (5,-3) would require moving right 5 steps and up 1 step. Along the way, there are walls at (2,-3), (2,-2), etc. So that path is blocked.

Alternative approach: Maybe instead of getting the key first, change the door's rule. But to do that, I need to rearrange text blocks. The ""rule `door`"" is at (5,-3). To change ""door is stop"" to something else, I need to move the ""door"" text block and combine it with another property.

For example, if I can make ""door is you"" or ""door is win"", then I can walk through the door or win by touching it.

But to do that, I need to move the ""door"" text block. Let's see where the ""is"" text blocks are. There's a rule `is` at (6,-3) (near the win rule), another at (1,1), and others at (-3,3), (-2,3), (-1,3).

So perhaps I can move the ""door"" rule from (5,-3) to combine with an ""is"" rule and a property. For example, if I move the ""door"" text block to next to an ""is"" and a ""win"" text block, making ""door is win"".

But to move the ""door"" text block, I need to be adjacent to it and push it, since it's not a ""stop"" unless defined. Currently, the only rule is ""baba is you"", so I can move any text blocks that are not ""stop"". Looking at the objects:

- The ""rule `is`"" blocks: can I move them? Since ""is"" is a property, unless there's a ""stop"" rule for ""is"", I can move them. Similarly for other rules.

So the plan is:

1. Move to the ""rule `door`"" at (5,-3) to manipulate it.
2. Combine it with an ""is"" rule and a property like ""win"" to make ""door is win"".

But to get there, from my starting position (-3,3), moving right 8 steps and down 6 steps would be too long and blocked by walls.

Alternative path: After getting the key, use the key to unlock something. But the key is at (0,-2), and the door is at (-2,2). Maybe the key is for a different door not mentioned here.

Alternatively, perhaps the key at (6,1) (rule `key` 6 steps to the right and 1 step down) is the one needed. But that's on the right side, blocked by walls.

This is getting too complicated. Let me think differently. The main goal is to reach ""win"", which is at (7,-3). The path is blocked by walls on the right. If I can change ""wall is stop"" to something else, like ""wall is push"" or ""wall is you"", then I could move through or push walls.

But to change that, I need to find the ""wall"" rule. The rule `wall` is at (3,-2) (3 steps left and 2 steps up from reference point, which is (-3,3) + (-3, -2) = (-6,1)? Wait, no. The rule `wall` is 3 steps left and 2 steps up from the reference point (which is the ""baba"" rule at (-3,3)). So that would be (-3 -3, 3 +2) = (-6,5). But that's probably not relevant.

Wait, the rule `wall` is listed as ""rule `wall` 3 step to the left and 2 step up"". So from the reference point (0,0), that's (-3, 2). So at position (-3,2), there's a ""wall"" rule tile. To change the ""wall"" property, I need to move that text block.

If I can move the ""wall"" rule to say ""rock is wall"" or change its property, but I don't have a ""rock"" tile here.

Alternatively, the active rule is ""baba is you"". If I can make ""wall is you"", then I can move through walls. But to do that, I need to move the ""wall"" rule and combine it with an ""is you"" rule.

Looking at the objects, there's a ""rule `you`"" at (1,-3) (1 step left and 3 steps down from reference point, which is (-1, -3) relative to (0,0)? No, need to recalculate.

The ""rule `you`"" is 1 step to the left and 3 steps down from the reference point (which is the ""baba"" rule at (-3,3)). So that would be (-3 -1, 3 -3) = (-4,0).

So to make ""wall is you"", I need to take the ""wall"" rule at (-","

Let's take a look at this Baba Is You level. The goal is usually to reach the ""WIN"" object, which I see right at the far end to the right. But first, I need to figure out how to get there without being blocked by walls or other obstacles.

The active rule right now is ""BABA IS YOU,"" which means whatever I move, I can manipulate the rules. The key object is up near the top, two steps up. There's also a door on the left side, two steps down. But doors are usually ""STOP"" unless there's a rule saying otherwise. The rule ""door IS door"" is down at the bottom, so maybe that doesn't change anything. Wait, there's a ""rule `door` 5 steps to the right and 3 steps down."" Hmm, not sure how that plays in.

First step: I need to get to the key. The key is two steps up, but there are walls blocking the path. The walls are to the right, so maybe I can move left to reach the key. But the rule ""stop"" is one step to the left and two steps up. If I move left past the stop, would that be possible? Wait, the ""stop"" rule is on a wall, so walls are defined as stop. But since I'm Baba and I can change rules, maybe I can make the wall not a stop. Let me check the current rules again. There's ""rule `wall` 3 step to the left and 2 step up."" So that wall has the ""wall IS wall"" rule, making it a stop. But if I can move that rule elsewhere, then maybe I can walk through it.

So, the plan is: move the ""wall"" rule (the one at 3 step left and 2 step up) to somewhere else, so the wall isn't a stop anymore. Then I can walk over it. But to move a rule, I have to be adjacent to it and then push it. Since I'm BABA, and the rules are text blocks, I can pick them up if they're not stopped. The ""stop"" rule is at 1 step left and 2 step up. So the wall's rule is three steps left and two up. The direction from me to that wall's rule would be left and up. I need to move left and up to reach it. But there's a wall two steps to the right and three steps up. Wait, maybe my position isn't clear. Let me visualize the map.

Assuming the player is at the starting position, which isn't explicitly stated, but looking at the objects, maybe the player is somewhere in the middle. The key is two steps up, but there are walls to the right blocking the path. To get to the key, I need to go left. The ""stop"" rule is one step left and two steps up, which is a wall. If I can remove that ""stop"" property, maybe by moving the ""wall"" rule or the ""stop"" rule.

Alternatively, maybe create a new rule that allows me to pass through walls. For example, if I can make ""BABA IS WIN"" or something, but that might not help. Or maybe ""WALL IS PUSH"" so I can move them out of the way. But how?

Another approach: The ""rule `is`"" blocks are movable. There's a rule ""is"" at 6 steps right and 3 up, which is part of the ""win"" rule. If I can get to that ""is"" block and move it, maybe I can change the ""win"" condition. But the ""win"" is at 7 steps right, so if I can make ""baba is win,"" then touching the win object would make me win. But to do that, I need to rearrange the ""baba is you"" rule. Wait, the current rule is ""baba is you,"" so if I can move that ""you"" part to another object, like making ""baba is win,"" then I could win by touching it. But how to do that?

The ""you"" rule is at 1 step left and 3 steps down. So if I can move the ""you"" block next to ""baba"" and ""is,"" then I can change the rule to ""baba is win."" Let me see the positions:

- The ""baba"" rule is at 3 steps left and 3 steps down.
- The ""is"" rule is at 2 steps left and 3 steps down.
- The ""you"" rule is at 1 step left and 3 steps down.

So they are all in a row to the left. If I can move the ""you"" block up next to the ""baba is"" part, then combine them into ""baba is you [moved] to win."" Wait, but the ""win"" rule is at 7 steps right and 3 steps up. That's quite far. Maybe this approach isn't feasible.

Alternatively, maybe use the ""key"" to unlock the door. The door is two steps to the left and two steps down. But doors are normally stop unless there's a rule saying door is not stop. The existing rule for door is at 5 steps right and 3 steps down, which is ""door IS door,"" so no change there. If I can make ""door IS KEY"" or something, but I don't have a key yet. The key is at 6 steps right and 1 step down. So moving the key to near the door might help, but I need to get there first.

Wait, the key is two steps up. So if I can reach the key by moving up, but the path is blocked by walls. The walls to the right are two steps right and 1, 2, 3 steps up. So to get to the key at two steps up, which is between those walls, maybe I need to move left past the stop wall. But the ""stop"" rule is at 1 step left and 2 step up, which is a wall. So if I can remove that ""stop"" property, then the wall becomes passable.

To remove the ""stop"" property, I need to move the ""stop"" rule. The ""stop"" rule is at 1 step left and 2 step up. If I can move that rule away, then the wall at that position would no longer be a stop. So I need to move the ""stop"" rule. To do that, I have to be adjacent to it and push it. Since I'm Baba (you), I can move. Let's see where the ""stop"" rule is. It's 1 step left and 2 steps up from my current position. Assuming my position is the origin, moving left and up twice gets me to the ""stop"" rule. If I can move that rule, say, one step down, then the wall at 1 left, 2 up would no longer be a stop. Then I can walk through it.

So the steps would be:

1. Move to the position of the ""stop"" rule (1 left, 2 up).
2. Push the ""stop"" rule down one step.
3. Then move left through the now non-stop wall to reach the key.
4. Pick up the key.
5. Use the key on the door, but the door is on the left side. Alternatively, maybe the key isn't needed if we can change rules instead.

But how to move the ""stop"" rule? Let's think about movement. From the current position (unknown, but let's assume I'm at the starting point near the bottom right, given the walls to the right), to get to the ""stop"" rule at 1 left and 2 up, I need to move left once and up twice. But the path might be blocked. Wait, the walls to the right are at 2 steps right and 1, 2, 3 steps up. So moving left from the starting position would avoid those walls. Let's say I move left once, then up twice to reach the ""stop"" rule. Once there, I can push it down. Then the wall at that position is no longer stop, allowing me to pass.

After that, moving left past that wall to the key at 2 steps up. Then pick up the key. Then, perhaps move to the door on the left side (2 steps left and 2 steps down). But the door is a stop unless we change its rule. Alternatively, maybe create a ""baba is key"" rule to pick up the door, but that's not straightforward.

Alternatively, after freeing the path to the key, get the key and bring it to the door. If the door requires a key, then placing the key next to the door might open it. But in Baba Is You, doors usually need a key unless a rule says otherwise. Since there's no ""key is door"" rule, maybe the key isn't needed. Hmm.

Another angle: The ""win"" rule is at 7 steps right and 3 steps up. To reach it, I need to go right, but there are walls blocking the path. The rule ""is"" is at 6 steps right and 3 steps up, part of the ""win"" rule. If I can rearrange the ""win"" rule to be under my control, like ""baba is win,"" then touching the win object would make me win. To do that, I need to move the ""you"" rule from the bottom to the ""baba is"" part.

The ""you"" rule is at 1 step left and 3 steps down. So I need to move that ""you"" block to the ""baba is"" area. Let's see the positions:

- ""baba"" rule: 3 left, 3 down
- ""is"" rule: 2 left, 3 down
- ""you"" rule: 1 left, 3 down

So they are all in a row to the left. To move the ""you"" rule up next to the ""baba is"" part, I need to move it right and up. But the path might be blocked. The walls to the right are at 2 steps right and 1, 2, 3 steps up. So moving right from the ""you"" rule's position (1 left, 3 down) would require going through those walls. Unless we've removed the stop property from those walls.

If I can first remove the stop property from the walls on the right, then maybe I can move the ""you"" rule. But that requires accessing those walls' rules, which are at 3 step left and 2 step up (wall rule) and 1 step left and 2 step up (stop rule). This is getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the simplest solution is to move the ""stop"" rule away, then go left to get the key, then use the key to open the door on the left, and then proceed left to the win object. But how?

Let me outline the possible steps again:

1. Move to the ""stop"" rule (1 left, 2 up) and push it down to remove the stop property from the wall.
2. Move left past the now passable wall to the key at 2 steps up.
3. Pick up the key (if possible) and bring it to the door on the left (2 steps left, 2 steps down).
4. Place the key next to the door, which might open it if there's a rule like ""key is unlock door,"" but there isn't one. So maybe the door just needs to be pushed.
5. Once the door is open or pushed aside, move left to the win object.

But I'm not sure if the key is necessary for the door. Alternatively, maybe after getting the key, I can create a new rule like ""key is door"" to make the key open the door. But to do that, I need to be near the door and the key.

Alternatively, after obtaining the key, move to the door and create the rule ""key is door"" by placing the key next to the door and the ""is"" rule. But the ""is"" rule is at 6 steps right and 3 steps up, which is far from the door.

This is getting a bit tangled. Let's focus on the immediate steps. The most critical obstacle is the ""stop"" rule blocking the path to the key. Removing that should allow progress.

So, to move the ""stop"" rule:

- Move left once to get to the position adjacent to the ""stop"" rule (1 left, 2 up).
- Then push the ""stop"" rule down one step. Since the ""stop"" rule is a text block, and unless it's stopped, I can move it. The ""stop"" rule is on a wall, but if the wall's stop property is from the ""wall IS wall"" rule at 3 left, 2 up, then moving the ""stop"" rule away would leave the wall as just a wall, not a stop. So pushing the ""stop"" rule down would make the wall passable.

Once that's done, I can move left through the wall to reach the key at 2 steps up. Then, pick up the key and move to the door on the left. But how to open the door? Maybe by pushing it, since doors are usually stop unless a rule allowsotherwise. If I can push the door left past the key, then I can access the area beyond.

Alternatively, maybe creating a new rule like ""baba is push"" to push objects, but the default is that you can push objects unless they're stop. Since the door is stop, I need to change that. If I can make ""door IS NOT STOP,"" then I can push it. But to do that, I need to modify the ""stop"" rule or create a new rule.

Another approach: After obtaining the key, move to the door and create a rule ""key IS door"" to unlock it. But I'm not sure if that's valid. In Baba Is You, you can create rules by placing text blocks next to each other. So if I have the key and the door, and an ""is"" block, I can say ""key IS door,"" which might make the key work on the door. Then, placing the key near the door would open it.

But the ""is"" block is at 6 steps right and 3 steps up, which is far from the door. So I would need to move that ""is"" block to near the door. That would take several steps.

This is getting quite involved. Maybe the easiest way is to first remove the ""stop"" property from the wall, then get the key, then use the key to open the door by creating a rule, then proceed left to the win.

So step-by-step:

1. Move from starting position (assuming bottom right?) to the ""stop"" rule at 1 left, 2 up.
   - To get there: left once, up twice.
2. Push the ""stop"" rule down one step. This removes the stop property from the wall at 1 left, 2 up.
3. Move left past that wall to the key at 2 steps up.
   - From the ""stop"" rule's new position (1 left, 3 up), move left to reach the key at 2 up.
4. Pick up the key (if possible by moving onto it).
5. Move to the door at 2 left, 2 down.
6. Find an ""is"" block to create the ""key IS door"" rule.
   - The nearest ""is"" block is at 6 right, 3 up. Need to move it down and left.
7. Once ""key IS door"" is created, placing the key near the door should open it.
8. Push the door left past the key to access the area beyond.
9. Finally, move left to the ""win"" object at 7 right, 3 up.

But this requires moving multiple rules, which might be complex. Alternatively, after step 3, with the key, move to the door and create the rule ""key IS door"" using the nearby ""is"" block. Then, the door might become pushable or unlockable.

However, in Baba Is You, rules are created by placing text blocks adjacent. So if I have the key, door, and an ""is"" block, placing them as ""key IS door"" would create that rule. Then, perhaps the door's stop property can be removed, allowing it to be pushed.

But I'm not entirely sure. Another possibility is that once ""key IS door"" is active, touching the door with the key would allow passage. But I need to test that.

Given the time constraints, the immediate action needed is to remove the ""stop"" rule to access the key. So the first valid action would be to move towards the ""stop"" rule and push it.

So, the chosen action is to move left and up towards the ""stop"" rule. The specific movement would be to go one step left and then two steps up to reach it. But how to express that in the action format?

The available actions are idle, up, down, left, right. But the problem is navigating to the correct position to push the ""stop"" rule.

Wait, the action must be one of the five: idle, up, down, left, right. So the agent can only move one step in one direction per action. Therefore, the agent needs to sequence multiple moves.

For example, first move left once, then up twice, then push the ""stop"" rule down. But each action is a single step. However, pushing an object requires being adjacent to it and then moving in the direction you want to push it. So the sequence would be:

1. Move left to get adjacent to the ""stop"" rule.
2. Move up again to be directly above or below the ""stop"" rule, depending on its position.
3. Then, move in the direction to push it (e.g., down).

But the observation doesn't provide the agent's current position, so it's challenging to determine the exact directions. However, based on the objects listed, the agent is likely starting near the bottom right, given the walls to the right and the win object far to the right.

Assuming the agent is at position (0,0), the ""stop"" rule is at (-1, 2) (1 step left, 2 steps up). To reach it, the agent needs to move left (to -1,0) then up twice (to -1,2). Once there, the agent can push the ""stop"" rule down to (-1,3), removing the stop property from the wall at (-1,2).

So the sequence of actions would be:

- left
- up
- up
- down (to push the stop rule down)

But each action is a single step. So the first three actions are moving to the stop rule's position, and the fourth is pushing it.

However, the problem requires choosing exactly one action per observation. Since the agent is defaulting to idle because previous responses were invalid, the agent needs to output a single valid action based on the current observation.

Given that, the immediate valid action to start the process is to move left once to get adjacent to the ""stop"" rule.

So the chosen action is left.

Let's try to figure out what to do here. The current rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I can move and manipulate text blocks. The goal is usually to reach a ""win"" object, but I need to check if that's still the case.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key two steps up. Maybe I need to get that key to open a door. But the key is behind a wall two steps up. Wait, there's a rule `win` seven steps to the right and three steps up. That's probably where I need to go, but there are walls blocking the path.

I see some `is` text blocks. The `is` block six steps to the right and three steps up was there before, but now after moving left, it's at seven steps right. Maybe I can move that `is` block to create a new rule. For example, if I can make ""baba is win"" or ""key is win,"" that might change the win condition. But how?

Also, there's a door two steps to the left and two steps down. The rule `door` is five steps to the right and three steps down. If I can change the door's property, maybe make it ""door is pass"" or something, then I could go through it. But doors are usually stops unless their rule changes.

Wait, the `rule `you`` is at one step to the left and three steps down. If I can make ""baba is you,"" which I already have, but maybe I need to make ""baba is win"" to reach the win block. To do that, I need to move the `is` block. Let's see: the `is` block is now seven steps to the right and three steps up. If I move it left, maybe I can attach it to ""baba"" and ""win.""

But to move the `is` block, I have to be adjacent to it. The current position of the `is` block is seven steps right and three up. Where am I located? The previous action was ""left,"" so maybe I moved left from my previous position. Let me check the objects again.

The key is now one step to the right and two steps up. The wall is three steps right and three up. The `is` block is seven steps right and three up. If I'm positioned such that I can move towards that `is` block, I can pick it up and move it. But I need to avoid walls. The path to the `is` block might be blocked by walls. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to rearrange the rules.

Another thought: the `rule `baba` is at two steps left and three steps down. If I can move that `baba` rule next to an `is` block and a `win` block, I could create ""baba is win."" Let's see where those objects are. The `win` block is eight steps right and three steps up. The `baba` rule is two steps left and three steps down. The `is` block is seven steps right and three steps up. So it's a bit scattered.

Alternatively, maybe I can make the door a stop or remove its stop property. The door is two steps left and two steps down. The `rule `door` is six steps right and three steps down. If I can move that `door` rule to adjacent blocks, perhaps changing it to ""door is pass"" or deleting it, but I need to see if that's possible.

Wait, the `stop` rule is two steps up. If I can remove the stop property from the wall, maybe I can go through it. But the `stop` rule is two steps up, so if I can move that to a different position, that might help. But how?

Let me recap the possible actions. I can move up, down, left, right, or idle. Also, I can move text blocks that aren't defined as stop. So I need to find an `is` block and attach it to a subject and property.

The key is at one step right and two steps up. If I can get the key, maybe I need to bring it to the door. The door is two steps left and two steps down. But the door is probably a stop unless its rule is changed. So maybe the solution involves picking up the key and using it elsewhere, but I don't see a lock or anything.

Looking at the `rule `you`` at three steps down. If I can make ""baba is you"" (which I already have), but maybe combining it with another rule. Wait, the active rule is only ""baba is you"" right now. The other rules are for wall, stop, key, door, etc.

Another approach: the `win` block is at eight steps right and three steps up. If I can create a rule that says ""win is you"" or something, but I don't have a `you` block nearby. Wait, there's a `rule `you`` at three steps down. If I can move that `you` rule next to the `win` block and an `is` block, then ""win is you"" would make the win condition become ""you,"" which I am. So that might work.

So the steps could be: move the `is` block to the position of the `win` block and the `you` rule. Let's see where those are. The `win` block is eight steps right and three steps up. The `you` rule is three steps down. The `is` block is seven steps right and three steps up. So maybe I need to move the `is` block from seven right, three up to eight right, three up (next to win) and then next to the `you` rule. But that might require moving the `is` block right and then down, but I have to navigate around walls.

Alternatively, move the `is` block to adjacent to `win` and `you`. Let's check the map again. After the last move left, the `is` block is seven steps right and three steps up. The `win` is eight right, three up. So if I move the `is` block one step right, it would be next to the `win` block. Then, if I can move the `you` rule up, but it's three steps down. Maybe this is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, focus on getting to the `key` first. The key is one step right and two steps up. There's a wall at three steps right and two steps up, but the key is one step right, two up. So if I move up twice and right once, I can get the key. But the path might be blocked. Let's see: from my current position (unknown, but after moving left, maybe I'm near the `is` block), moving up to reach the key. But there's a wall at three steps right and two steps up. Wait, the key is at one step right and two steps up. So maybe I can move up two steps and right one step to get the key. But I need to check if there are walls in between.

But I'm not sure where exactly I am. The problem is that the observation doesn't tell me my current position, only the positions of objects relative to me. So I have to infer my position based on the objects. For example, the wall two steps right and three up suggests that I'm somewhere to the left of that wall. Similarly, the `is` block six steps right and three up was originally, but after moving left, it's now seven steps right. This is a bit confusing without knowing my exact location.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is at a position I can reach by moving left and up. Let's think: the key is two steps up. If I move up twice, I can get there. But I need to avoid walls. The wall two steps up is at three steps right and two steps up. So if I'm positioned such that moving up two steps and left one step gets me to the key, that might work. But without knowing my exact position, it's hard to be precise.

Another strategy: since I'm Baba and can move, maybe I need to reach the `win` block directly. But it's blocked by walls. The `win` block is eight steps right and three steps up. There are walls at three, two, and one steps right in the upper areas. So getting there directly might not be possible. Hence, the need to change rules.

The most promising approach seems to be creating a rule that makes Baba equal to Win. To do that, I need to move an `is` block next to Baba and Win. The `baba` rule is at two steps left and three steps down. The `win` block is eight steps right and three steps up. The `is` block is seven steps right and three steps up. So if I can move the `is` block from seven right, three up to eight right, three up (adjacent to win), and then move the `baba` rule to be next to that `is` block, then the rule ""baba is win"" would be created, making Baba equal to Win, so touching Win would make me win.

To do this, I need to move the `is` block right once. But how do I get to the `is` block? The `is` block is seven steps right and three steps up. If I'm positioned to the left of that, I can move right. But my current position isn't clear. Alternatively, maybe I can move down to the `is` block. The `is` block is at three steps up. If I move up three steps, I can reach it. But there's a wall at three steps right and three up. So moving up three steps and right seven steps might be possible if the path isn't blocked.

This is getting a bit tangled. Let's try to outline the steps:

1. Move to the `is` block at seven steps right and three steps up.
2. Pick up the `is` block and move it one step right to be adjacent to the `win` block (eight steps right, three steps up).
3. Move the `baba` rule (two steps left, three steps down) up to be adjacent to the new `is` block and the `win` block, creating ""baba is win"".
4. Now, as Baba, touching the `win` block would make me win.

To execute this, I need to navigate to the `is` block. Let's assume I'm currently near the previous position after moving left. If the last action was ""left,"" maybe I'm one step left from where I was before. But without knowing the exact starting position, it's challenging. 

Alternatively, focus on moving the `is` block. The `is` block is seven steps right and three steps up. To get there, I might need to move right and up. But if there are walls in the way, that's a problem. The wall at three steps right and three up is directly above the `is` block. So moving right to seven steps right and up three steps would require passing through that wall, but since I'm Baba and the rule is ""baba is you,"" and walls are defined by the `wall` rule, which is at three steps left and two steps up, maybe I can move through walls? No, because walls have the `stop` property unless the rule is changed. The `stop` rule is at one step left and two steps up. So unless I remove the `stop` property from the wall, I can't pass through it.

This complicates things. Maybe the solution involves removing the `wall` property from a wall block, making it passable. To do that, I need to create a rule like ""wall is not stop"" or ""wall is nothing."" But how?

Alternatively, use the key to unlock something, but there's no mention of a lock in the current objects. The door is present, but it's at two steps left and two steps down. The `rule `door` is five steps right and three steps down. If I can change the door's rule to ""door is pass,"" then I could go through it. To do that, I need to move the `door` rule next to the door block and an `is` block. For example, move the `is` block next to the door and the `door` rule, creating ""door is pass.""

But again, navigating to those positions is tricky. The door is two steps left and two steps down. The `is` block is seven steps right and three steps up. So maybe this isn't the immediate path.

Another angle: the `key` is at one step right and two steps up. If I can get the key and bring it to the door, maybe the door becomes passable. But there's no rule linking key to door here. The `key` rule is at six steps right and one step down. So unless I create a rule like ""key is open,"" but that's not present.

Back to the original idea: creating ""baba is win."" To do that, I need to move the `is` block next to `baba` and `win`. The `baba` rule is at two steps left and three steps down. The `win` block is at eight steps right and three steps up. The `is` block is at seven steps right and three steps up. So if I can move the `is` block from seven right, three up to eight right, three up (next to win), and then move the `baba` rule up to be adjacent, that would work.

To move the `is` block right, I need to be adjacent to it. The `is` block is seven steps right and three steps up. If I'm to the left of it, I can move right. But my current position isn't known. However, after moving left previously, maybe I'm now positioned such that moving right a few times gets me to the `is` block.

Assuming I can move right towards the `is` block, the next action would be to move right. But I need to check if there are any walls blocking the path. The wall is at three steps right and three up, which is to the left of the `is` block. So moving right from my current position (assuming I'm near) would take me past the wall? No, because the wall is at three steps right, so if I'm moving right from a position less than three steps right, I would hit the wall at three steps right. Wait, the wall is two steps to the right and three steps up. So if I'm at, say, one step right and three steps up, moving right to two steps right would hit the wall. But the `is` block is seven steps right, which is much further. This suggests that there's a long path to the `is` block, possibly blocked by multiple walls.

This is getting too complicated without knowing the exact layout and position. Maybe a simpler approach: move towards the `is` block and rearrange the rules. Let's try to move right towards the `is` block. The `is` block is seven steps right and three steps up. If I can move right repeatedly, but avoiding walls. However, based on the map, there are walls at various positions that might block the path.

Alternatively, move down to the `is` block. The `is` block is at three steps up. If I move down from my current position, but again, without knowing where I am, it's hard to say.

Another possibility: the `rule `you`` is at three steps down. If I can create ""you is win,"" but I'm already ""baba is you,"" so if I make ""you is win,"" then since I'm you, I would be win. But how to create that rule. The `you` rule is at one step to the left and three steps down. The `win` block is eight steps right and three steps up. So moving the `you` rule next to `win` and an `is` block would create ""you is win."" Then, since I'm you, I would be win.

To do that, I need to move the `you` rule to adjacent to `win` and `is`. The `is` block is seven steps right and three steps up. The `you` rule is one step left and three steps down. This seems quite far apart. Maybe this isn't feasible.

Given the time I've spent and the previous failures, maybe the best immediate action is to move towards the `is` block to pick it up and rearrange the rules. So I'll choose to move right to get closer to the `is` block.

Let's see. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" so I can move around and interact with text blocks. The goal is usually to get to the ""win"" object, but I need to check if that's still the case.

Looking at the objects, there's a ""key"" two steps up. Maybe I need to get the key first to unlock something? But moving up might be blocked by walls. Let me check the map layout. 

To the left and up, there are walls and a ""stop"" rule. The ""stop"" makes those objects immovable. The ""key"" is two steps up, but there's a wall two steps to the right and up. Wait, maybe I can move left instead to get to the key? But there's a wall three steps to the left and two steps up. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to rearrange the rules to remove the walls.

The ""is"" text blocks are scattered. If I can move one of them to create a new rule, like ""key is push"" or change ""wall"" to something else. For example, moving the ""is"" block that's six steps to the right and three up to combine with ""wall"" or ""stop."" But can I move that ""is"" block? The direction isn't specified here, but usually, text blocks can be moved if they aren't stopped. 

There's a ""rule `is`"" at 1 step right and 1 down. Maybe moving that near other rule texts to form a new rule. Like, if I move ""is"" next to ""baba"" and ""you"" to make ""baba is you,"" but that's already active. Wait, the active rule is already ""baba is you,"" so maybe I need to create another rule. 

The door is two steps left and two down. If I can make the door a ""win"" by moving the ""win"" rule onto it. The ""win"" rule is seven steps to the right and three up. If I can move that ""win"" rule to the door's location, then touching the door would make it a win. But how to move the ""win"" rule? There's a lot of walls blocking the path. Maybe first get past the walls by changing their properties. 

Looking at the ""rule `wall`"" at three steps left and two up. If I can move that ""wall"" rule to somewhere else, maybe to make a different object a wall. But I need to find an ""is"" block nearby. The ""is"" at six steps right and three up is close to the ""win"" rule. If I move the ""wall"" rule to the ""is"" block, then maybe create ""wall is stop"" or something. Wait, but ""stop"" is already a rule. 

Alternatively, maybe move the ""is"" block next to ""baba"" and ""you"" to create ""baba is you"" again, but that's redundant. Wait, the current active rule is ""baba is you,"" so maybe I can make ""you"" into something else. Like, ""you is win"" so that touching anything named ""you"" (which is Baba) would make it a win. But how to create that rule. 

The ""rule `you`"" is at 1 step left and 3 steps down. If I can move that ""you"" rule and combine it with an ""is"" block. For example, move ""you"" next to ""is"" and ""win"" to make ""you is win."" That way, Baba (which is you) would be a win. Then, just moving towards the door or anywhere else would trigger the win. But how to move those blocks. 

The ""is"" blocks are at various positions. The one at 2 steps left and 3 steps down is near the ""you"" rule. If I can move the ""you"" rule to that ""is"" block and then combine with ""win,"" that might work. But I need to physically move the text blocks. 

To move a text block, I have to be adjacent to it and not blocked by a ""stop"" or ""wall"" that's defined as stop. The Baba is at the starting position, which I assume is somewhere central. Looking at the map, the walls are forming a barrier. The key is two steps up, but there's a wall two steps right and up. Maybe I need to move the ""key"" to a different location? 

Alternatively, use the key to unlock a door. But there's no lock mentioned. The door is at two steps left and two down. If I can make the door a ""win"" by moving the ""win"" rule there. The ""win"" rule is seven steps right and three up. To get there, I need to move right multiple times, but there are walls blocking. For example, two steps right and three up has a wall. So maybe I need to remove that wall's rule. 

The ""rule `wall`"" is at three steps left and two up. If I can move that ""wall"" rule away, then the path might clear. But how? To move that ""wall"" rule, I need to be adjacent to it. The position of the Baba is not explicitly stated, but maybe the starting position is near the bottom center. Let's assume I'm positioned somewhere in the middle. 

From the current observation, the key is two steps up. If I move up twice, but there's a wall two steps right and two up. Wait, the walls are arranged such that moving up from the starting position might hit walls. Maybe I need to go left to get around. The ""door"" is two steps left and two down. If I can reach there and make it a win. 

Alternatively, since ""baba is you,"" I can push objects if they're defined as ""push."" But there's no ""push"" rule active. The ""stop"" rule is present, which makes objects immovable. So, maybe I need to change the ""stop"" rule. 

The ""rule `stop`"" is at one step left and two up. If I can move that ""stop"" rule and replace it with something else, like ""stop is nothing"" or ""push is stop."" Not sure. 

Another approach: The ""rule `baba`"" is at three steps left and three steps down. If I can move that ""baba"" rule next to an ""is"" block and then combine with another property, like ""win."" For example, moving ""baba"" next to ""is"" and ""win"" to create ""baba is win."" But that would require those blocks to be adjacent. 

Looking at the positions, the ""baba"" rule is three steps left and three down. The ""is"" rule is two steps left and three down. The ""win"" rule is seven steps right and three up. It's a bit far. Maybe moving the ""baba"" rule closer. 

To move the ""baba"" rule, I need to be adjacent to it. If I move left three steps from the starting position, but there are walls. The wall two steps to the right and three up might be blocking the path. 

Alternatively, use the ""is"" blocks to create new rules. For example, take the ""is"" block at six steps right and three up, move it next to ""wall"" and ""stop"" to create ""wall is stop,"" but that's already there. 

Wait, the current active rules are only ""baba is you."" All other rules are text blocks on the map. So the key is to pick up text blocks and place them to form new rules. 

The ""key"" is two steps up. If I can get the key, but there's a wall two steps right and two up. Maybe I need to move that wall's rule. The ""rule `wall`"" is at three steps left and two up. If I can move that ""wall"" rule to elsewhere, then the path might clear. 

So the plan could be: move to the ""wall"" rule at three steps left and two up, pick it up (by moving adjacent), then move it to a different location to remove the wall. For example, move the ""wall"" rule next to a ""stop"" rule to create ""wall is stop,"" which is already there, so that doesn't help. 

Alternatively, move the ""wall"" rule to the position where a wall is, effectively removing it. But walls are objects, not rules. Hmm, this is confusing. 

Wait, in Baba Is You, text blocks define the rules. So if there's a ""wall is stop"" rule, then walls are stop. If you remove that rule, then walls might not be stop anymore. But the walls themselves are still on the map. So maybe the goal is to change the properties of objects by moving the rules. 

For example, if there's a wall at a certain position, and the rule is ""wall is stop,"" then that wall is stop. If I can remove the ""wall is stop"" rule, then the wall might no longer be stop, allowing me to push it or move past it. 

So, to do that, I need to move the ""rule `wall`"" that's at three steps left and two up. If I can move that rule away, then the wall's property as stop would be removed. 

So steps: move to the ""rule `wall`"" at three steps left and two up, pick it up (move adjacent), then move it to a different spot, like next to a ""stop"" rule, but that might not help. Alternatively, move it off the grid so it's no longer affecting anything. 

But how to move the text blocks. Let's think about my position. The starting position isn't given, but based on the objects, maybe I'm near the bottom middle. To reach the ""rule `wall`"" at three steps left and two up, I need to move left three times and up two times. But along the way, are there walls blocking? 

Looking at the map: there's a wall two steps to the right and three up. So if I'm moving left from the starting position, maybe that's clear. The ""stop"" rule is one step left and two up. So moving left three steps and up two steps would require passing through those areas. 

Assuming I can move left and up without hitting walls (since the ""stop"" is at one step left and two up, but that's a rule, not an object), maybe I can navigate there. 

Once I have the ""rule `wall`"" block, I can move it elsewhere. For example, place it next to a ""you"" rule to create ""wall is you,"" which would make walls act like you, meaning I can move through them. But that might not be safe. 

Alternatively, move the ""wall"" rule to the position of a ""stop"" rule, combining them into ""wall is stop"" again, which doesn't change anything. 

This is getting complicated. Maybe another approach: create a ""you"" rule for the door. The door is at two steps left and two down. If I can make the door a ""you,"" then touching it would make me you, and since I'm already you, that might not help. Wait, no. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" so if the door is ""you,"" then touching it would make it you, but I'm already you. 

Alternatively, make the door a ""win"" by moving the ""win"" rule to its location. The ""win"" rule is seven steps to the right and three up. To move it there, I need to traverse a path blocked by walls. 

Another idea: Use the key. If I can get the key from two steps up, then maybe unlock something. But there's a wall two steps right and two up. To get past that wall, I might need to change its property. 

If I can remove the ""wall is stop"" rule, then the wall becomes regular, and I can move past it. So again, the plan is to move the ""rule `wall`"" block. 

Let me try to outline the steps:

1. Move to the ""rule `wall`"" block at three steps left and two up.
2. Pick it up and move it to a different location, perhaps next to nothing, so the rule is no longer active, removing the wall's stop property.
3. Then, navigate past the wall to get to the key or the door.
4. If the door is made into a win, then touching it would win the level.

But how to execute this. Let's think about the movement. 

First, from the current position, where am I? The objects are described relative to my position. For example, ""wall 2 steps to the right and 3 step up"" means to the right and up from me there's a wall. So my current position is probably at the bottom center, looking up and to the left. 

To reach the ""rule `wall`"" at three steps left and two up, I need to move left three times and up two times. But along the way, are there any stops? The ""stop"" rule is at one step left and two up. That's a rule, not an object, so it might not block movement. 

Assuming I can move left and up freely past the ""stop"" rule (since it's a rule, not an object), I can reach the ""rule `wall`"" block. Then, move it. Once I have that rule, I can place it somewhere else to deactivate the wall's stop property. 

For example, place the ""wall"" rule next to a ""push"" rule (if available), but there's no push rule here. Alternatively, place it next to nothing, effectively removing the ""wall is stop"" rule. 

Once the wall's stop property is removed, I can move past it. Then, go to the key at two steps up, pick it up, and use it on the door. But how does the key work? In Baba Is You, keys usually unlock doors, but the game might vary. 

Alternatively, after removing the wall's stop property, move right past the walls to get to the ""win"" rule at seven steps right and three up. But there's a wall two steps right and three up. If the wall's stop property is removed, maybe I can push it or move past it. 

Wait, if the wall's rule is removed, then it's just a wall object without the ""stop"" property. So maybe I can move through it? No, walls are solid unless their rule is changed. For example, if ""wall is stop"" is removed, then walls might not be stop, but they might still be walls. Wait, no. The ""stop"" property makes them immovable. Without ""wall is stop,"" the walls might still be there but not stop. So I could potentially push them or move around them. 

But in this case, the wall at two steps right and three up has the ""rule `wall`"" at three steps left and two up. If I remove that ""rule `wall`,"" does the wall object disappear? Or does the wall remain but without the ""wall"" property? This is a bit unclear. 

In Baba Is You, text blocks define the properties. So a wall object with the ""wall is stop"" rule is a stop wall. If the ""wall is stop"" rule is removed, the wall might no longer be stop, but it's still a wall. However, without the ""wall"" rule, it might just be a neutral object. 

This is getting a bit complicated. Maybe a better approach is to create a ""you"" rule for the door. The door is at two steps left and two down. If I can make the door a ""you,"" then touching it would make me you, but I'm already you. Hmm, not helpful. 

Alternatively, make the door a ""win"" by moving the ""win"" rule to its position. The ""win"" rule is seven steps right and three up. To move it there, I need to go right seven steps and down three steps, but there are walls blocking. 

Another idea: Use the ""key"" to unlock the door. If the door requires a key, then picking up the key (which is two steps up) and then moving to the door (two steps left and two down) and using the key there. But how to interact with the key and door in the game. 

In Baba Is You, you can push objects if they're defined as pushable. Since there's no ""push"" rule, maybe the key can be moved. Once I have the key, I can move it to the door's location. If the door is a ""key"" receiver, then placing the key there might unlock it. 

So steps:

1. Move to the key at two steps up.
2. Pick up the key and move it to the door at two steps left and two down.
3. Place the key near the door, which might unlock it, making it a win condition.

But how to move the key. To get to the key, which is two steps up, I need to move up twice. However, there's a wall two steps right and two up. If I can remove that wall's stop property by moving its rule, then I can pass through. 

This circles back to the earlier problem of moving the ""rule `wall`"" block. 

Perhaps the correct sequence is:

- Move to the ""rule `wall`"" at three steps left and two up.
- Pick it up and move it away, removing the ""wall is stop"" rule.
- Then, move right past the previously stop wall.
- Go up to the key, pick it up.
- Move left to the door and place the key there, unlocking it to become a win.

Alternatively, after removing the wall's stop property, move directly to the door and change its rule to ""win.""

But to change the door's rule, I need an ""is"" block. The ""is"" block is at six steps right and three up. So I would need to move that ""is"" block to the door's location and combine it with ""door"" and ""win.""

This requires navigating from the current position to the ""is"" block, then to the door, which is quite involved. 

Given the time constraints and the fact that previous attempts led to idle actions, maybe the immediate action is to move left towards the ""rule `you`"" block at one step left and three steps down. By moving there and combining it with an ""is"" block, I can create a new rule like ""you is win,"" making Baba (you) a win.

To do that:

1. Move left three steps to reach the ""rule `you`"" block.
2. Move down to the ""is"" block at two steps left and three steps down.
3. Combine them to create ""you is win.""

But the movement required would be:

From current position, to get to the ""you"" rule at 1 step left and 3 steps down:

- Move left once.
- Move down three times.

But need to check if the path is blocked. The ""stop"" rule is at one step left and two up, which is a rule, not an object, so it might not block movement. The walls are objects, but if their stop property is removed, they might not block.

Let's see. I need to figure out how to solve this Baba Is You level. The current active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means whatever I move, I can push or manipulate other objects, but I have to avoid anything that's a ""STOP"" property.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key located 2 steps up. To get to the key, I might need to move up, but there are walls blocking the path. The walls are positioned 2 steps to the right and 3 steps up, and there are more walls down below. The rule blocks also mention ""wall is"" and ""stop"" rules. 

The goal is usually to reach the ""win"" object, which is 7 steps to the right and 3 steps up. But right now, the path is blocked by walls. The ""is"" rule blocks are scattered around, so maybe I can move them to create a new rule. For instance, if I can get to the ""rule `is` 6 steps to the right and 3 step up"" and move it somewhere else, maybe I can change a property. 

Wait, the ""rule `baba` 3 step to the left and 3 steps down"" and ""rule `is`"" and ""rule `you`"" are down there. If I can move the ""you"" rule to become ""baba is you,"" that would make me Baba. But the problem is that some objects are tagged as ""stop,"" meaning I can't push them. Let me check which objects are stop. There's a ""rule `stop` 1 step to the left and 2 step up."" Hmm, so that text block is immovable. 

The key is at 2 steps up. If I can move up past the walls. Let's see: starting position isn't specified, but assuming I'm somewhere in the maze. To get to the key, I need to go up 2 steps. But there's a wall 2 steps to the right and 3 steps up. Wait, maybe I need to move left to avoid the walls. The key is 2 steps up, so maybe moving up first. But the path is blocked. 

Alternatively, maybe I can use the ""is"" rules to create a new rule. For example, if I move the ""rule `is` 1 step to the right and 1 step down"" to combine with others. But how? I need to navigate to that rule. Let's think: the rule `is` is 1 step right and 1 step down from the current position. If I can move right and down to pick it up, then move it somewhere else to form a new rule. 

But wait, the walls are 2 steps to the right in various positions. Maybe I need to find a way around. If I move left, there's a ""rule `stop`"" at 1 step left and 2 step up, which I can't push past. So moving left might not help immediately. 

The door is 2 steps to the left and 2 steps down. If I could open it, that might provide a path, but the door's rule is ""rule `door` 5 steps to the right and 3 steps down."" To make the door passable, I might need to change its rule, like making ""door is win"" or ""door is not stop."" 

Alternatively, since I'm Baba and ""baba is you,"" maybe I can manipulate the text blocks. If I can grab the ""rule `you` 1 step to the left and 3 steps down"" and combine it with ""rule `baba`"" to make ""baba is you,"" but I need to be on the same tile as both the ""baba"" rule and the ""you"" rule. 

Let me map this out. The ""rule `baba`"" is 3 steps left and 3 steps down from the current position. The ""rule `you`"" is 1 step left and 3 steps down. So if I move left three steps to reach the ""rule `baba`"" tile, then move left another step to get to the ""rule `you`"" tile, I could potentially combine them. But how do I move there? There are walls in the way. 

The walls are 2 steps to the right in various positions. Maybe I need to move in a different direction. For example, moving up to the key first, but the path is blocked. Alternatively, moving down to the lower rules. The ""rule `is`"" at 1 step right and 1 step down might be accessible. 

If I move down and right, I can reach that ""rule `is`"" block. Then, move it to a different location to create a new rule. For instance, moving it to the ""rule `baba`"" tile and combining it with ""you"" to make ""baba is you."" But I need to be careful with the directions. 

Another approach: the ""key"" is at 2 steps up. If I can move up two steps, avoiding the walls. The walls at 2 steps right and up might be pushable if they are not STOP. Wait, the ""wall is"" rule is at 3 steps left and 2 steps up. So the walls have the ""wall is"" rule, meaning they are walls. The ""stop"" rule is a separate object. 

So, maybe I can push the walls if they are not STOP. But the ""stop"" rule is at 1 step left and 2 step up, which is a text block, not a wall. So the walls can be pushed unless they are defined as STOP. Since the walls have ""wall is"" rule, they are walls but not STOP. So I can push them. 

Wait, the rules are ""baba is you,"" so I can push objects unless they are STOP. The ""stop"" rule is a separate object. So the walls can be pushed, but the ""stop"" rule makes whatever it's applied to immovable. In this case, the ""stop"" rule is at 1 step left and 2 step up. So any object at that position would be STOP, but looking at the objects, there's a wall 3 steps left and 2 steps up. Wait, the ""rule `stop`"" is a separate object. So the wall at 3 steps left and 2 steps up is a wall, but the ""rule `stop`"" is at 1 step left and 2 steps up. So maybe the wall next to the stop rule is STOP. 

This is getting complicated. Let me try to visualize the map. 

Looking at the objects:

- Walls are at various positions, some with ""wall is"" rules.
- The ""stop"" rule is at 1 step left and 2 step up. So whatever object is at that position (if any) is STOP. But looking at the objects, there's a wall at 3 steps left and 2 steps up. The ""stop"" rule is a separate object at 1 step left and 2 step up. So maybe the wall at 3 steps left and 2 steps up is not STOP, but the ""stop"" rule is there. So if I push a wall into the ""stop"" rule's position, would it become STOP? Probably, because the ""stop"" rule defines that whatever is in that position has the STOP property. 

But I'm not sure. The rules in Baba Is You are usually that text blocks on the same row define the properties. So if there's a ""stop"" text block next to an object, that object becomes STOP. 

So, the ""rule `stop` 1 step to the left and 2 step up"" is a text block. Any object adjacent to it would inherit the STOP property. Wait, no. The rules are formed by text blocks in the format ""[Subject] IS [Property]"". So the ""rule `stop`"" must be part of a rule like ""X IS STOP"". But in the current active rules, the only active rule is ""baba is you"". The other rules are text blocks on the map but not active until combined. 

So the ""rule `stop`"" is a text block that can be used to create a new rule, like ""wall IS STOP"" if moved next to a wall. 

This is crucial. So to make a wall STOP, I need to move the ""wall"" text block next to the ""stop"" text block. 

Similarly, to make Baba ""you"", I need to move the ""baba"" text block next to the ""you"" text block. 

Looking at the current objects:

- There's a ""rule `baba` 3 step to the left and 3 steps down"".
- A ""rule `you` 1 step to the left and 3 steps down"".
- So if I can move these two text blocks next to each other, creating ""baba IS you"", then I would become Baba (since I'm you) and can then push things. 

But how to get there? The position of the player isn't specified, but assuming I'm starting somewhere in the maze. Let's assume I need to move left to reach those text blocks. 

The door is 2 steps left and 2 steps down. The ""rule `door`"" is 5 steps right and 3 steps down. Maybe changing the door's rule to ""win"" would allow passage. 

Alternatively, the key is at 2 steps up. If I can get the key, maybe that unlocks something, but the key's rule is at 6 steps right and 1 step down. Not sure. 

Another angle: the ""win"" rule is 7 steps right and 3 steps up. To reach there, I need to push past walls. But the path is blocked by walls. However, if I can change the ""wall IS wall"" rule to something else, like ""wall IS PUSH"" or remove it, then the walls wouldn't block me. 

For example, if I move the ""rule `wall` 3 step to the left and 2 step up"" next to the ""rule `is` 6 steps to the right and 3 step up"", I could create a new rule like ""wall IS [something else]"". 

But this requires navigating to those positions. 

Alternatively, the ""rule `is` 1 step to the right and 1 step down"" is closer. If I can move that ""is"" rule to combine with other text blocks. 

Let me try to outline steps:

1. Move to the position of the ""rule `is` 1 step to the right and 1 step down"".
2. Combine it with the ""rule `baba`"" and ""rule `you`"" to create ""baba IS you"".
3. Then, as Baba, I can push objects and change other rules.

But to do that, I need to reach those text blocks. 

Assuming the player is starting near the top, maybe they need to move left to reach the lower area where the ""baba"" and ""you"" rules are. 

The door is 2 steps left and 2 steps down. If I can open the door by changing its rule to ""door IS OPEN"" or ""door IS WIN"", that might help. 

Alternatively, the ""key"" at 2 steps up. If I pick up the key, maybe it's used to unlock the door. But in Baba Is You, keys usually unlock doors, but the game mechanics might require placing the key on the door. 

However, the current rules don't mention a key rule. So unless I create a ""key IS OPEN"" rule or similar, the key might not be useful yet. 

Putting it all together, the critical step seems to be manipulating the ""baba"" and ""you"" rules to become ""baba IS you"". To do that, I need to move the ""you"" rule to be adjacent to the ""baba"" rule, using an ""is"" rule. 

Looking at the positions:

- ""rule `baba`"" is at 3 steps left and 3 steps down.
- ""rule `you`"" is at 1 step left and 3 steps down.
- There's a ""rule `is`"" at 2 steps left and 3 steps down.

If I can move the ""rule `is`"" next to the ""baba"" and ""you"" rules, I can form the ""baba IS you"" rule. 

For example, moving the ""is"" rule from 2 steps left and 3 steps down to be between ""baba"" and ""you"", so that they form ""baba IS you"". 

To do that, I would need to move left three steps to reach the ""baba"" rule, then move left another step to get to the ""you"" rule, but there's the ""is"" rule in between. 

Alternatively, move the ""is"" rule to the right next to the ""you"" rule. 

This requires navigating through the maze, avoiding walls. 

Given the walls are positioned 2 steps to the right in various directions, moving left seems challenging but possible. 

The ""stop"" rule is at 1 step left and 2 step up, so moving left past that area might be blocked unless I can remove the ""stop"" rule. 

But the ""stop"" rule is a text block; to remove it, I might need to move it away, but since it's a rule, perhaps combining it with another rule to change its property. 

Alternatively, if I can make the ""stop"" rule part of a different rule that negates it, like ""stop IS NOTHING"", but that's more advanced. 

For now, focusing on reaching the ""baba"" and ""you"" rules. 

Assuming the player is starting at a position where moving left is possible, the next action should be to move left to get closer to those text blocks. 

So the chosen action is ""left"".

Let's see. The goal is to reach the ""win"" object, which is usually a door or something similar, but in Baba Is You, the rules can change. Right now, the active rule is ""baba is you,"" meaning I control Baba. The ""win"" object is positioned at 7 steps to the right and 3 steps up. There's a key at 2 steps up, which I might need to pick up first to unlock a door.

Looking at the map, there are walls blocking some paths. The key is at 2 steps up, so maybe I should go up to get it. But wait, moving up might require navigating around walls. Let me check the objects again. There's a ""rule `is`"" block at 6 steps right and 3 up. Since ""is"" is a rule, I can move it to change other rules. But right now, the main active rule is ""baba is you,"" so I can interact with text blocks.

If I get the key, maybe there's a door that's a ""stop"" or needs the key. The door is at 2 steps left and 2 steps down. But how do I reach it? There's a wall blocking the direct path. Also, the ""rule `you`"" is at 1 step left and 3 steps down. If I can make myself ""you,"" maybe I can push objects or override stop rules. But first, let's focus on the immediate goal.

The key is 2 steps up. From my current position, moving up two steps would get me there. But are there walls in the way? The map shows walls at 2 steps right and 2,1 steps up. So moving up would require going past those walls. Wait, but since I'm Baba and the rule is ""baba is you,"" maybe I can push the walls if they're defined as stop. The ""rule `stop`"" is at 1 step left and 2 step up. If I can move that rule, maybe walls become movable. But moving the ""stop"" rule might be risky.

Alternatively, maybe I should move the ""is"" rule blocks to create new rules. For example, if I take the ""is"" block at 6 right and 3 up and combine it with ""baba"" and ""win"" or something else. But I need to reach that ""is"" block first. It's 6 steps to the right and 3 up, which is quite far. Maybe moving right multiple times. But there are walls at 2 steps right and down positions. Hmm.

Wait, the key is nearby. Let me try to get the key first. If I move up twice, I can reach the key. But the path might be blocked. Let me visualize the map. The objects are arranged with walls and rules. Moving up from my current position (assuming I'm at the starting point, maybe origin), moving up two steps would take me to where the key is. But are there walls in between? The walls are at 2 steps right and 2,1 steps up. So if I'm moving up, the walls are to the right, not blocking the upward path. So moving up twice should reach the key.

Once I have the key, perhaps I can use it on a door. The door is at 2 steps left and 2 steps down. But how to get there? There's a wall at 2 steps right and 2 steps down. If I can make that wall not a stop, maybe I can pass through. Alternatively, if I can create a ""key IS WIN"" rule, but that might not be possible without modifying existing rules.

Another approach: Since ""baba is you,"" I can move any text block that isn't stopped. The ""stop"" rule is at 1 step left and 2 step up. If I can move that ""stop"" rule elsewhere, maybe the walls become passable. For example, moving ""stop"" to a different position so that walls no longer have the stop property. But how to do that? I need to pick up the ""stop"" rule and move it. To move a rule, I have to be adjacent to it and move in a direction, right?

So if I go left once to reach the ""stop"" rule at 1 step left and 2 step up, then move it somewhere else. But moving left from the current position would take me to where the ""rule `you`"" is at 1 step left and 3 steps down. Wait, no. The current position after some moves might have changed. Let me recheck the observation.

In the latest observation, after moving left, the active rules and objects have changed. The key is now at 1 step right and 2 step up, and the ""is"" rules are shifted. The ""rule `baba`"" is at 3 steps left and 3 steps down. The ""you"" rule is at 1 step left and 3 steps down. So maybe the player has moved left previously, altering the map.

The priority is to reach the ""win"" rule, which is now at 8 steps right and 3 up. That's quite far. Alternatively, the ""win"" object might be a door that's a ""stop"" unless changed. The door is at 1 step left and 2 steps down. To get there, I need to navigate around walls. If I can make the door not a stop, maybe by changing its rule.

Alternatively, perhaps creating a new rule like ""baba is win"" so that touching the door makes me win. But to do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule block to combine with ""baba"" and ""win"". The ""is"" block is at 7 steps right and 3 up. So moving right multiple times to get there, but there are walls blocking the path.

Wait, the current position after moving left previously might have shifted the player's location. The observation shows that after moving left, the walls and rules have shifted positions. The ""key"" is now at 1 step right and 2 step up. So maybe the player is now at a different starting point.

Given the complexity, perhaps the best immediate action is to move right towards the key to pick it up. Then, use the key to unlock a door. Alternatively, move the ""is"" rule to create a new rule like ""baba is win"".

But considering valid actions, the possible moves are up, down, left, right, or idle. Since the assistant previously failed due to invalid actions, I need to ensure the chosen action is valid based on the current observation.

In the current observation, the player can move in directions that aren't blocked by ""stop"" rules unless they have moved the relevant blocks. Since ""baba is you"" is active, and ""stop"" is at 2 step up, but the player is not currently stopped unless they're on a stop object. Wait, the ""stop"" rule is a property. If a tile has ""stop"", then unless the player is defined as not stop, they can't move into it. But since the player is Baba and ""baba is you"", and there's no rule saying ""baba is stop"", they can move over stop tiles unless the stop rule is applied to them.

But in the current observation, the ""rule `stop`"" is at 2 step up. So if the player moves into that tile, would it stop them? Probably not, because the stop rule is a separate block. Unless there's a rule like ""baba is stop"", which there isn't. So the player can move over the stop block unless it's part of a rule that affects them.

Therefore, the player can likely move in any direction unless there's a wall in the way. The walls are physical obstacles. So to move up, the player needs to check if there's a wall in that direction.

Looking at the objects, moving up from the current position (assuming after moving left previously) would require checking if there's a wall in the up direction. The walls are at various positions, but specifically, there's a wall at 2 steps right and 3 step up. Wait, no. The current observation lists walls at specific positions relative to the player. For example, ""wall 2 steps to the right and 3 step up"" means that two steps right and three up from the player's current position is a wall. Similarly for other walls.

So if the player is trying to move up, they need to see if there's a wall in that direction. If not, they can move. Let's parse the objects again:

- wall 2 steps right and 3 up
- rule `is` 6 right, 3 up
- rule `win` 7 right, 3 up
- rule `wall` 3 left, 2 up
- rule `stop` 1 left, 2 up
- key 2 up
- walls at 2 right, 2 up; 2 right, 1 up; 2 right
- rule `is` 1 right, 1 down
- etc.

Assuming the player is at the origin (0,0), the key is at (0,2). To get there, move up twice. But between (0,0) and (0,2), are there walls? The walls are at (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (2,0), etc. So moving up from (0,0) to (0,1) is clear, then to (0,2) where the key is. So moving up twice should reach the key.

Once the key is obtained, the player can use it on the door at ( -1, -2 ). But to get there, need to navigate around walls. The door is at (-1, -2), which is left and down from the player's current position after getting the key. There's a wall at (2,2) up, but once the key is taken, maybe a door is unlocked.

Alternatively, after getting the key, move left to the door's position. But there's a wall at (2,2) down, which might block the path. Wait, the walls are at various positions, some to the right, some above and below.

Another strategy: Move the ""is"" rule block to create a new rule. For example, take the ""is"" at (6,3) and bring it to combine with ""baba"" and ""win"". But that requires moving right 6 times and up 3, which is a long way, and there are walls at (2,3), (2,2), etc. So moving right past those walls might be possible if the player can push them, but since they're walls, and the player is you, maybe they can be pushed if not stopped.

But the ""stop"" rule is at ( -1, 2 ), so if the player moves into that area, they might be stopped. Hmm. This is getting complicated. Maybe the priority is to get the key and then use it to unlock the door, which is a win condition.

So the immediate action should be to move up twice to get the key. Then, move left and down towards the door. But need to ensure the path is clear. Alternatively, use the key on the door by moving it next to the door and using the key rule.

Wait, in Baba Is You, using a key typically means moving the key onto a door, which then becomes passable. So if the door is a ""stop"" but has a key on it, maybe it's no longer stop. But the current door is at (-1, -2), and the key is at (0,2) after moving up. So the player would need to carry the key to the door. But how? The player can carry objects if they touch them, I think. So moving the key block to the door's position and then placing it there.

Alternatively, create a rule like ""key is win"" so that touching the key makes you win. But that would require moving the ""is"" block to create that rule.

But given the time constraints, perhaps the best first step is to move up to get the key. So the chosen action would be ""up"" twice. However, the assistant can only output one action per step. So first move up once, reach the key, then up again. But in the current observation, after moving left previously, the key is at 1 step right and 2 step up. Wait, no, the latest observation shows the key at 1 step right and 2 step up. So from the player's current position, moving right once and up twice would reach the key. Or maybe up twice then right once.

Wait, the key's position is 1 step right and 2 steps up. So from the player's current position (let's assume after moving left, the player is at a different location), the direction to the key would be right and up. But need to check the exact path.

Alternatively, the player is at (0,0), key is at (1,2). So to get there, move right once, then up twice. But there's a wall at (2,3), which is far away. Between (0,0) and (1,2), are there walls? The walls are at (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (2,0), etc. So moving right to (1,0) is clear, then up to (1,1) and (1,2), where the key is. So the path is clear. Therefore, the action should be right then up twice. But since each action is one step, the first action should be right, then up, then up.

But the system requires choosing one action per step. So in the current observation, the player needs to choose the next action. If the previous action was left, leading to this state, the player is now at a new position. But without knowing the exact current position, it's a bit tricky. However, based on the objects listed, the key is at 1 step right and 2 steps up, so moving right once gets closer.

Alternatively, maybe the player is already at the key's position. No, because the key is at 1 step right and 2 up, so the player must move there. Therefore, the best action is to move right to approach the key.

Let's see. The active rule is ""baba is you"", so I can move around as Baba. The goal is usually to reach the ""win"" condition, which is probably the door or something else marked as win. But in the current setup, the ""win"" rule is 7 steps to the right and 3 steps up. But there are walls blocking that path.

Looking at the objects, there's a key at 2 steps up. To get the key, I might need to move up. But moving up there are walls. Wait, the key is 2 steps up, and there's a rule 'is' at 6 steps right and 3 up. Maybe I can move the 'is' text block to change a rule. 

The door is 2 steps left and 2 steps down. But there's a 'rule door' at 5 steps right and 3 steps down. Not sure. The 'win' is a rule on the far right, so maybe I need to get there by moving right past the walls. But those walls are probably STOP because of the 'rule wall' somewhere. 

Wait, the 'rule wall' is at 3 steps left and 2 steps up. But I'm Baba, and the default rule is 'baba is you', so maybe I can push objects that are not STOP. The 'stop' rule is at 1 step left and 2 steps up. So walls and stop objects can't be moved. 

The key is at 2 steps up. If I move up twice, but there's a wall at 2 steps right and 2 steps up. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe I can move the 'is' text block to create a new rule. For example, moving 'is' next to 'baba' to make ""baba is win"" or something. 

Looking at the bottom left, there's a rule 'baba' at 3 steps left and 3 steps down, and a rule 'is' next to it, and 'you' at 1 step left and 3 steps down. If I can combine 'baba', 'is', and 'win', maybe I can make ""baba is win"" which would make touching Baba the win condition. Then I can just move to where Baba is, which is probably my starting position. 

But how to get those text blocks together. The 'is' is at 2 steps left and 3 steps down, and 'you' is at 1 step left and 3 steps down. The 'baba' rule is at 3 steps left and 3 steps down. So if I move the 'is' text block one step left, next to 'baba', then create ""baba is you"" again, but maybe adjacent to 'win' somewhere. Wait, the 'win' rule is at 7 steps right and 3 steps up. That's far away. Maybe another approach. 

Alternatively, since I'm Baba and I can move, maybe I can push the 'rule is' block that's 1 step right and 1 step down. If I move right towards it, maybe I can pick it up and place it near other rules. For example, placing 'is' next to 'baba' and 'win' to make ""baba is win"". That would change the win condition to being Baba, so touching myself would win. 

But how to reach that 'is' block. The 'is' is 1 step right and 1 step down. So if I move down once, I'm at the same level as that 'is' block. But there's a wall 2 steps right and 1 step down. Wait, the wall is at 2 steps right and 1 step down. So if I'm at my current position, maybe I can move left to get to the 'is' block. 

Wait, the initial position isn't specified, but the objects are listed relative to the player. The player must be somewhere not listed, probably in a central position. Let's assume the player is at the starting point, and the objects are around. To get to the 'is' block at 1 step right and 1 step down, I need to move down and right. But there's a wall at 2 steps right and 1 step down. So moving right once, then down might be blocked. 

Alternatively, maybe moving left to reach the 'baba', 'is', and 'you' rules at the bottom left. If I can move left three steps, but there's a wall at 3 steps left and 3 steps down. Wait, the wall is at 2 steps right and 3 steps down? No, looking back, the wall is at 2 steps right and 3 steps down. So maybe the player is to the left of that. 

This is getting a bit confusing. Let's recap. The key steps are:

1. The active rule is ""baba is you"", so I can move.
2. The goal is probably to reach the ""win"" rule, but it's blocked by walls.
3. Possible solutions: Move text blocks to create new rules, like ""baba is win"" or ""you is win"".
4. The 'is' text blocks are available. Need to maneuver them to combine with other rules.

Looking at the objects, there's a 'rule is' at 6 steps right and 3 up, and another at 1 step right and 1 down. Maybe moving the lower 'is' block to the left to connect with 'baba' and 'win' elsewhere. 

But how to move the 'is' block. Since I'm Baba, and the 'is' isn't STOP, I can move it. So if I move right to get to the 'is' block at 1 step right and 1 down, then move it left to place next to 'baba' which is at 3 steps left and 3 steps down. Wait, the 'baba' rule is 3 steps left and 3 steps down from where? Maybe the player is positioned such that moving left three steps reaches the 'baba' rule. 

Alternatively, perhaps the player is near the bottom left cluster of rules. If I can move left to get to the 'baba', 'is', and 'you' rules, then rearrange them to create ""baba is win"". 

But the 'win' rule is way to the right. Maybe another approach: Make ""key is win"" so picking up the key wins. The key is at 2 steps up. If I can get the key and then place a rule like ""key is win"", then picking up the key would make me win. 

To do that, I need to move up to the key's position. The key is at 2 steps up. There's a wall at 2 steps right and 2 steps up. So moving up two steps, but the path is blocked. Unless I can move the wall or change its rule. 

The 'rule wall' is at 3 steps left and 2 steps up. If I can move that 'wall' rule, maybe I can remove the wall property. But how? By moving the 'wall' rule away, or combining it with another rule. For example, if I make ""wall is stop"", but that's already the case with the 'stop' rule at 1 step left and 2 steps up. 

This is getting complicated. Let's try to prioritize. The key is nearby. If I can reach the key, maybe that's a step towards winning. To get to the key at 2 steps up, I need to move up, but there's a wall at 2 steps right and 2 steps up. 

Wait, the player's position is unknown, but the objects are listed relative to the player. Let's assume the player is at position (0,0). Then:

- Wall at (2,3) up → (2,3)
- 'is' rule at (6,3)
- 'win' at (7,3)
- 'wall' rule at (-3,2)
- 'stop' rule at (-1,2)
- key at (0,2)
- walls at (2,2), (2,1), (2,0)
- 'is' at (1, -1)
- wall at (2,-1)
- 'key' rule at (6,-1)
- door at (-2,-2)
- wall at (2,-2)
- 'baba' rule at (-3,-3)
- 'is' at (-2,-3)
- 'you' at (-1,-3)
- wall at (2,-3)
- 'door' rule at (5,-3)

So the player is likely at (0,0). To get to the key at (0,2), need to move up two steps. But between (0,0) and (0,2), there's a wall at (2,2). So moving up directly is blocked. 

Alternative path: Move left to (-1,0), (-2,0), etc., but there's a 'stop' rule at (-1,2), which might be a stop wall. 

Another idea: Use the 'is' rule at (6,3) to create a new rule. If I can move that 'is' down and left to combine with 'baba' and 'win'. But that's a long distance. 

Alternatively, the 'is' at (1,-1). If I can move that 'is' block to the left, near the 'baba' rule at (-3,-3). That would require moving left from (1,-1) to (-3,-3), but there are walls at (2,-3) and others. 

This is tricky. Maybe the solution is to move to the 'is' block at (1,-1), pick it up, and move it left to combine with 'baba' and 'you' to make ""baba is you"" again, but that's the existing rule. 

Wait, the existing rule is ""baba is you"", so maybe we need to make ""baba is win"". To do that, we need 'baba', 'is', and 'win' adjacent. The 'win' is at (7,3), which is far to the right. 

Another angle: The 'door' is at (-2,-2), and there's a 'rule door' at (5,-3). Maybe changing the door's rule. If we make ""door is you"", then touching the door would make us you, but we're already you. Not sure. 

Alternatively, make ""key is win"" so picking up the key wins. To do that, we need to place 'key' and 'win' next to an 'is' rule. The 'key' object is at (0,2), and the 'win' rule is at (7,3). The 'is' rule at (6,3) is near 'win'. So if we move the 'is' from (6,3) to (7,3), adjacent to 'win', then create ""win is key""? No, we need ""key is win"". So move 'is' to between 'key' and 'win'. 

But the 'key' is at (0,2), and 'win' is at (7,3). The 'is' is at (6,3). So moving 'is' one step right to (7,3), next to 'win', then the rule would be ""win is [something]"". Wait, no. The 'is' needs to be between 'key' and 'win'. But they are far apart. 

This seems impossible. Maybe the intended solution is to move the 'is' block at (1,-1) to the left to connect with 'baba' and 'win' elsewhere. For example, move 'is' left to (-2,-1), then place it between 'baba' at (-3,-3) and 'win' at (7,3). But that's a huge distance. 

Alternatively, focus on the bottom left cluster. The 'baba' rule is at (-3,-3), 'is' at (-2,-3), and 'you' at (-1,-3). If I can add 'win' next to them, but where is 'win'? At (7,3). Not nearby. 

Maybe the solution is to push the 'rule is' at (6,3) down and left to reach the 'win' rule. But again, distance is an issue. 

Another thought: The door is at (-2,-2). If I can make ""door is win"", then reaching the door would win. To do that, need 'door', 'is', 'win' adjacent. The 'door' is at (-2,-2), 'win' is at (7,3). The 'is' is at (6,3). Maybe move 'is' down to (-2,-2) and place between 'door' and 'win'? Not sure. 

Alternatively, since I'm Baba and ""baba is you"", maybe I can push the 'rule you' at (-1,-3) to create a new rule. For example, make ""you is win"", so touching 'you' (which I am) would win. But how? 

If I can move the 'you' rule to be adjacent to 'win', then combining them with 'is' would create ""you is win"". The 'you' is at (-1,-3), 'win' at (7,3). The 'is' is at (6,3). So move 'is' from (6,3) to (7,3), then 'you' from (-1,-3) to (7,3)? That's impossible due to distance. 

This is really challenging. Maybe the simplest solution is to move the 'is' block at (1,-1) to the left to connect with 'baba' and 'you' to create ""baba is you"" again, but that's redundant. 

Wait, the existing rule is ""baba is you"", so perhaps we need to create a new rule like ""baba is win"". To do that, we need 'baba', 'is', and 'win' adjacent. The 'baba' rule is at (-3,-3), 'win' is at (7,3). The 'is' is at (6,3). So moving 'is' from (6,3) to (7,3), adjacent to 'win', then moving 'baba' rule to be adjacent? But 'baba' is at (-3,-3). 

This seems impossible. Maybe the intended move is to move left towards the bottom left cluster to rearrange the rules. For example, moving left to get to the 'baba', 'is', 'you' rules, then move the 'is' to connect with 'baba' and 'win' somehow. 

Alternatively, since the key is at (0,2), and there's a 'rule key' at (6,-1), maybe pick up the key and then use it to modify a rule. But how? 

Another angle: The 'stop' rule is at (-1,2). If I can remove the 'stop' property from the wall, then that wall becomes movable. For example, move the 'stop' rule away or combine it with another rule. 

But the 'stop' rule is at (-1,2), and the wall is at (-3,2). If I can move the 'stop' rule to be adjacent to the wall, then the rule would be ""wall is stop"", which is already the case. Not helpful. 

Perhaps the solution is to move the 'is' block at (6,3) down to (6,2) or (6,1), then left to combine with 'baba' and 'win' elsewhere. But again, distance is a problem. 

Wait, maybe the key is a distraction. The main goal is to reach the 'win' rule. Since 'baba is you', if I can make 'baba' a 'win', then touching myself would win. To do that, create ""baba is win"" by placing 'baba', 'is', 'win' adjacent. 

The 'baba' rule is at (-3,-3), 'win' is at (7,3). The 'is' is at (6,3). So moving 'is' from (6,3) to (7,3) next to 'win', then moving 'baba' rule from (-3,-3) to (7,3)? No, that's impossible. 

Alternative idea: Use the 'is' at (1,-1). Move it left to (-2,-1), then down to (-2,-3), adjacent to 'baba' at (-3,-3). Then place 'is' between 'baba' and 'win'... but 'win' is far away. 

This is really tricky. Maybe the answer is to move left towards the 'baba', 'is', 'you' cluster to rearrange the rules. For example, move left three steps to reach (-3,-3) where the 'baba' rule is, then move the 'is' there to make ""baba is you"" again, but that's the same as before. 

Alternatively, move the 'you' rule next to 'win' to make ""you is win"". But 'you' is at (-1,-3), 'win' at (7,3). Distance is too great. 

At this point, I'm stuck. The most plausible action is to move towards the 'is' block at (1,-1) to potentially create a new rule. So the action would be to move left or down to reach that 'is' block.

Let's see. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I can move Baba around. The goal is usually to reach a ""win"" object, but I need to check if that's still the case.

Looking at the objects, there's a ""key 1 step to the right and 2 step up."" Maybe I need to get the key to unlock a door. Then there's a ""door 1 step to the left and 2 steps down."" Wait, the door might be blocking the path to the win condition. 

But the current active rules don't mention anything changing the win condition yet. So I still need to get to the ""rule `win`"" which is 7 steps to the right and 3 steps up. However, the path is blocked by walls. There's a ""rule `is`"" at 6 steps right and 3 steps up, which could be used to create new rules. 

Hmm, maybe I can move the ""rule `is`"" to rearrange the rules. Since ""is"" is a rule that allows creating new rules, if I can place it next to other texts, I can form new rules. For example, if I can get ""baba"" and ""you"" together with ""is,"" I could make ""baba is you,"" which is already active. But maybe there's another combination. 

Looking at the objects, there's a ""rule `you`"" at 1 step to the left and 3 steps down. If I can get that near ""baba"" and ""is,"" maybe I can make ""baba is you"" again, but that's already the case. Alternatively, what if I make ""key is win""? Then picking up the key would make it a win condition. But where is the key? It's 1 step right and 2 steps up. If I can move towards it, but there are walls. 

Wait, the current position of Baba isn't specified here. The observation lists the objects relative to Baba, but I don't know where Baba is located. That's a problem. Without knowing Baba's position, it's hard to plan the path. 

Assuming I'm at the starting point, maybe the key is to the right and up. But there are walls in the way. The ""rule `is`"" is at 6 steps right and 3 steps up. If I can move that rule closer to ""baba"" and ""you"" to create new rules. For example, moving ""rule `is`"" to be next to ""rule `baba`"" and ""rule `you`"" to form ""baba is you"" again, which is already active. 

Alternatively, maybe create ""key is win"" by placing ""key"" next to ""win"" with ""is."" The ""key"" is at 6 steps right and 1 step down, and ""win"" is at 7 steps right and 3 steps up. That's a bit far. 

Another angle: the ""door"" is at 1 step left and 2 steps down. If I can make the door a ""stop"" or remove its ""stop"" property, maybe I can pass through. The ""rule `stop`"" is at 2 steps up. If I can move that rule away or replace it, perhaps the door isn't a stop anymore. 

But how do I move the rules? The rules are objects that can be moved unless they're defined as ""stop."" The current rules don't have any ""stop"" on them except ""rule `stop`"" at 2 steps up. Wait, the ""rule `stop`"" is an object, but its property is ""stop,"" which might mean it's immovable. So I can't move that one. 

The other rules like ""rule `is`"" can probably be moved since they don't have a ""stop"" property attached. So maybe I can grab ""rule `is`"" and move it to combine with other texts. For example, moving ""rule `is`"" next to ""rule `baba`"" and ""rule `you`"" to reinforce ""baba is you,"" but that's already the case. 

Alternatively, create ""baba is win"" by placing ""baba"" next to ""win"" with ""is."" The ""baba"" rule is at 3 steps left and 3 steps down. The ""win"" is at 7 steps right and 3 steps up. That's a significant distance. Maybe not feasible without moving through walls. 

Wait, there's a ""key"" nearby. If I can get the key and then use it to unlock the door. But the door is at 1 step left and 2 steps down. To reach it, I might need to move left and down, but there are walls in the way. The path might be blocked by walls at 2 steps right in various directions. 

Alternatively, change the door's property. If I can make the door a ""stop"" or remove its ""door"" property, but I don't have the right rules for that. The active rule is only ""baba is you,"" so I can't create new rules yet unless I move the ""is"" rule. 

So the plan might be: move the ""rule `is`"" to create a new rule. For example, place ""is"" next to ""key"" and ""win"" to make ""key is win."" Then picking up the key would make it a win condition. Let's see where those are. The ""key"" is 1 step right and 2 steps up, and ""win"" is 7 steps right and 3 steps up. The ""is"" rule is at 6 steps right and 3 steps up. If I move ""is"" down to 1 step right and 2 steps up (where the key is), then place it between key and win? But the positions are not adjacent. 

Alternatively, move ""is"" to the area where ""baba"" and ""you"" are. The ""baba"" rule is at 3 steps left and 3 steps down, and ""you"" is at 1 step left and 3 steps down. If I can get ""is"" between them, that would reinforce ""baba is you,"" but it's already active. 

Hmm. Maybe the immediate goal is to reach the key to unlock the door. To do that, navigate through the walls. But the path is blocked. For example, to get to the key at 1 step right and 2 steps up, I need to move right and up, but there's a wall at 2 steps right and 2 steps up. So maybe move the wall? But walls have a ""stop"" property, which means they can't be moved unless the rule allows it. Since ""rule `stop`"" is present, those walls are immovable. 

This is tricky. Maybe the solution is to create a new rule that allows moving through walls. For example, ""wall is stop"" is already there, but if I can change that. Wait, the existing rules are ""baba is you,"" ""wall is stop,"" ""stop is stop,"" etc. If I can make ""wall is not stop,"" but how? 

To create a new rule, I need to have ""is"" next to two objects. For example, if I can get ""is"" next to ""wall"" and ""stop,"" then make ""wall is stop"" which is already there. Not helpful. 

Alternatively, create ""push is you,"" but I don't have that rule. 

Wait, the ""rule `you`"" is at 1 step left and 3 steps down. If I can move ""you"" to be next to ""baba,"" making ""baba is you"" again, but that's redundant. 

Another idea: since ""baba is you,"" I can push other objects if they have a ""push"" rule. But there's no such rule here. 

Maybe the key is necessary. Let's focus on getting the key. The key is at 1 step right and 2 steps up. My current position is unknown, but assuming I'm near the starting point. To move right and up, but there's a wall at 2 steps right and 2 steps up. So I can't go through that. 

Alternatively, move the ""rule `is`"" to the key's location. The ""is"" is at 6 steps right and 3 steps up. If I move left and down to reach the key area. But how? Each move is one step. It might take several steps to navigate around the walls. 

This is getting complicated. Maybe the solution is to create a new rule that makes the door a win condition. For example, ""door is win."" To do that, I need to move ""is"" next to ""door"" and ""win."" The ""door"" is at 1 step left and 2 steps down, and ""win"" is at 7 steps right and 3 steps up. The ""is"" rule is at 6 steps right and 3 steps up. If I move ""is"" left and down to be near the door and win, but they are far apart. 

Alternatively, use the existing ""win"" rule at 7 steps right and 3 steps up. Maybe change the win condition to something reachable. For example, ""baba is win"" by placing ""baba"" next to ""win"" with ""is."" The ""baba"" rule is at 3 steps left and 3 steps down. So moving ""is"" to be between them. Let's see: if I move ""is"" from 6 right, 3 up to 4 right, 3 up, then 3 right, 3 up would be at the ""baba"" rule's location. Wait, the ""baba"" rule is 3 steps left from where? Maybe the coordinates are relative to Baba's position. This is getting confusing without knowing Baba's exact location. 

Alternatively, prioritize moving towards the ""rule `is`"" at 6 steps right and 3 steps up to create new rules. For example, move ""is"" next to ""key"" and ""win"" to make ""key is win."" Then picking up the key would trigger the win. 

To do that, I need to navigate to the ""key"" at 1 step right and 2 steps up. But the path is blocked by walls. Maybe move the walls? But they are stopped by ""rule `stop`."" 

This is really challenging. Maybe the correct action is to move towards the ""rule `is`"" to create new rules. Let's say I move right to get closer to it. Since the ""is"" is at 6 steps right and 3 steps up, and assuming I'm to the left of that, moving right multiple times. But each move has to be one step. 

Alternatively, the immediate action should be to move left to reach the ""rule `you`"" and combine it with ""baba"" and ""is"" to reinforce the rules. 

Wait, the ""you"" rule is at 1 step left and 3 steps down. If I can move left and down to get there, but there might be walls. 

This is tricky. Maybe the best action is to move right towards the ""rule `is`"" to have more flexibility in creating new rules. So the chosen action is ""right.""

Let's try to figure out what to do here. The active rule is still ""baba is you,"" which means I can move and interact with things. The goal is usually to reach a ""win"" object, which in this case seems to be the door or maybe the key. But first, I need to look at the objects around.

Looking at the map, there's a key two steps up. Maybe I need to get that to unlock something. But the path to the key is blocked by walls on the right. Wait, the walls are 2 steps to the right and 3 steps up, and others in that area. The ""is"" rule blocks is at 6 steps right, 3 up. Hmm, how do I move the ""is"" rule? Oh right, I can move text blocks if they're not STOP. So maybe I need to move the ""is"" rule to create a new rule.

Alternatively, the door is two steps left and two steps down. But there's a wall blocking the way? Let me check the objects. There's a door at 2 steps left and 2 steps down. But between me and the door, are there walls? The observation shows walls in various positions. Maybe I need to move a wall to clear a path.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at 1 step left and 2 step up. So anything with ""stop"" can't be moved. So the walls next to the stop are immovable. But the ""is"" rule at 6 steps right, 3 up is movable. If I can move that ""is"" rule, maybe I can create a new rule like ""baba is win"" to make myself the win condition, allowing me to touch the door without needing a key.

Alternatively, moving the ""you"" rule. The ""you"" rule is at 1 step left and 3 steps down. If I can get that near me, then maybe I become the you, but I'm already baba is you. Wait, maybe I need to make ""baba is win"" so that touching the door wins.

But how to move the ""is"" rule. Let's see, the ""is"" rule is 6 steps right and 3 up. If I move left from that position, maybe I can place it next to ""baba"" or ""win"". For example, moving the ""is"" rule to the left would position it next to the ""baba"" rule at 3 steps left and 3 steps down. Wait, the ""baba"" rule is at 3 steps left and 3 steps down. If I can move the ""is"" there, then I can create ""baba is win"" by placing ""is"" between ""baba"" and ""win"".

But how to get to that ""is"" rule. The current position of the ""is"" is 6 steps right and 3 up. To get there, I need to move left multiple times. Let's count: my current position isn't specified, but the objects are relative. Assuming I'm at the starting point, maybe the key is two steps up, but the walls are blocking. Alternatively, maybe I need to move the ""is"" rule from the top right to the bottom left where ""baba"" and ""you"" are.

Alternatively, pick up the ""key"" and use it to unlock the door. But to get the key, I need to move through the walls. The key is two steps up, but there are walls at 2 steps right and 2 up, etc. So maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to create a path. For example, if I can make ""wall is stop"" or something, but the active rule is ""baba is you"", so I can move objects that aren't stop.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at 1 step left and 2 up, so any object with ""stop"" can't be moved. So the walls next to stop are immovable. But other walls like the ones two steps right can be moved if their rules aren't stop. So perhaps I need to move the ""is"" rule to redefined properties.

The plan: move the ""is"" rule from 6 steps right, 3 up to adjacent to ""baba"" and ""you"" to create new rules. For example, moving ""is"" next to ""baba"" and ""win"" to make ""baba is win"". Then touching the door would make me win.

To do that, I need to navigate to the ""is"" rule's position. From the current observation, the ""is"" is 6 steps right and 3 up. So from my current position (unknown, but likely at the bottom left since the ""baba"" rule is 3 steps left and 3 down), moving right 6 steps and up 3 would reach the ""is"" rule. But there are walls blocking the way. For example, walls at 2 steps right and 3 up, and others. So maybe I need to move those walls by redefining their rules.

Alternatively, use the ""is"" rule to create a path. For instance, move the ""is"" rule to the left to create a rule like ""wall is stop"", but that might not help. Alternatively, create ""door is you"" so that touching the door makes me win.

But the key step is to move the ""is"" rule. Let's see, the current active rules are ""baba is you"". So I can move any text block that's not stop. The ""is"" rule is not stop, so I can pick it up and move it.

So the action would be to move right multiple times to reach the ""is"" rule at 6 steps right, 3 up. But how many steps? From the observation, each step is relative. If the ""is"" is 6 steps right and 3 up, then I need to move right 6 times and up 3 times. But maybe there's a more efficient way.

Alternatively, move the ""is"" rule to the left next to the ""baba"" rule. For example, move the ""is"" one step left to be adjacent to ""baba"", then place it next to ""win"" to make ""baba is win"".

But first, I need to grab the ""is"" rule. So the action sequence would be: move right until reaching the ""is"" rule (6 steps right, 3 up), then move left to position it next to ""baba"" and ""win"".

But given that previous attempts have resulted in defaults to idle, maybe the correct action now is to move left from the current position to reach the ""is"" rule's location. Wait, the last observation after moving left had the map shifted, so perhaps each movement changes the relative positions.

Alternatively, since the ""is"" rule is 6 steps right and 3 up, maybe I need to move right 6 times and up 3 times. But that's a lot of steps. Maybe there's a closer ""is"" rule. Wait, there's another ""is"" rule at 1 step right and 1 step down. Maybe that's closer.

Wait, in the current observation, there's a rule `is` at 1 step right and 1 step down. So if I can move that ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" and ""you"", that might help. For example, moving that ""is"" up to be next to ""baba"" at 3 steps left and 3 steps down. But how?

Alternatively, the ""you"" rule is at 1 step left and 3 steps down. If I can make ""baba is you"" into ""you is win"", but that requires redefining.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me try to outline steps:

1. Move to the ""is"" rule at 6 steps right and 3 up to grab it.
2. Move left to position it next to ""baba"" at 3 steps left and 3 steps down.
3. Place the ""is"" between ""baba"" and ""win"" to create ""baba is win"".
4. Then, touching the door (which is win) would make me win.

But how to execute this. Let's see, the ""is"" is at 6 right, 3 up. To get there, from the current position (assuming I'm at 0,0), I need to move right 6 and up 3. But the path is blocked by walls. For example, at 2 steps right and 3 up there's a wall. So maybe I need to move that wall by redefining its rule.

Alternatively, use the existing ""is"" at 1 step right and 1 step down. If I can move that ""is"" up to the top where the key and win are.

Alternatively, the key is at 2 steps up. Maybe pick up the key and use it on the door. But the door is two steps left and two steps down. To get there, I need to navigate through walls.

Alternatively, create a rule that makes walls stop, but since I'm baba, and rules are ""baba is you"", I can move text blocks. So if I can make a rule like ""wall is stop"", then moving through walls would be blocked, but that's not helpful. Wait, ""stop"" means the object can't be moved. So if a wall is defined as stop, I can't move it. But in the current rules, the wall at 3 left and 2 up is a regular wall.

This is tricky. Maybe the fastest way is to move the ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" and ""win"". Let's try:

First, move right to reach the ""is"" at 6 right, 3 up. But there's a wall at 2 right, 3 up. So how? Maybe move the wall by redefining its rule. For example, create ""wall is stop"", but that requires an ""is"" rule next to it.

Alternatively, use the existing ""is"" at 1 right, 1 down. Move that ""is"" up to the top. For example, move up from 1 right, 1 down to reach the top ""is"" at 6 right, 3 up. But that would require moving right 5 and up 2, which might be possible if the path is clear.

Wait, the ""is"" at 1 right, 1 down is closer. Let's focus on that. If I can move that ""is"" rule to be next to ""baba"" and ""you"", then create new rules.

For example, move the ""is"" from 1 right, 1 down to 3 left, 3 down (where ""baba"" is). Then place ""is"" between ""baba"" and ""you"" to make ""baba is you"", but that's already the case. Alternatively, place it between ""baba"" and ""win"" at the top right.

But the ""win"" is at 7 right, 3 up. So moving the ""is"" from 1 right, 1 down to 7 right, 3 up would require moving right 6 and up 2. That's a lot of steps. Maybe not feasible.

Alternatively, create a rule that makes ""baba"" the same as ""win"". So if I can write ""baba is win"" by moving the ""is"" next to both.

Given the time I've spent and previous failures, maybe the immediate action is to move left to reach the ""is"" rule nearby. The last observation after moving left showed the map shifted, so perhaps moving left again would get closer.

Alternatively, the correct action is to grab the ""is"" rule and move it to the desired position. Since the previous attempts resulted in idle, maybe the correct step now is to move right towards the ""is"" rule at 6 right, 3 up. But how?

Alternatively, the key is at 2 steps up. Maybe move up to get the key, but the path is blocked by walls. So perhaps move the walls by redefining their rules. For example, create ""wall is stop"" to make them immovable, but that doesn't help. Alternatively, create ""wall is push"" or something, but I don't have that rule.

Wait, the active rule is only ""baba is you"". So I can't create new properties yet. I need to first move the ""is"" rule to create new rules.

So the priority is to move the ""is"" rule. The closest ""is"" is at 1 right, 1 down. Let's move that one. To move it, I need to be adjacent to it and then move in a direction. Assuming I'm next to it, the action would be to take the ""is"" rule and move it. But how to represent that in the action list? The available actions are idle, up, down, left, right. So perhaps the action is to move right or left to reach the ""is"" rule.

In the current observation, the ""is"" rule is at 1 step right and 1 step down. So if I'm at the same position as Baba, I need to move down once to reach the ""is"" rule. Then, once I have it, I can move it around. But how does the game handle carrying text blocks? I think you have to move in the direction while carrying, but the available actions are just movement. Maybe the action is to move towards the ""is"" rule.

But the problem is that the assistant's output is just a single direction (up, down, left, right, or idle). So perhaps the correct action now is to move down to reach the ""is"" rule at 1 right, 1 down. Then, once there, move it left or up to position it next to ""baba"" or ""win"".

But given the previous failures, maybe the immediate action is to move left to reach the ""is"" rule. Alternatively, the correct step is to move right towards the ""is"" at 6 right, 3 up. But how many steps?

This is really challenging without knowing Baba's exact position. But based on the objects' positions, maybe the best bet is to move left to get to the area with the ""baba"" rule and the ""is"" at 2 left and 3 down. Then, move the ""is"" there to create ""baba is win"".

So the action would be to move left multiple times to reach that area. Alternatively, move up to reach the key.

But considering the time I've spent and the previous defaults, I'll go with moving left to position near the ""baba"" rule and the ""is"" there.

Let's try to figure this out. The current active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I can move and interact with other objects. The goal is usually to reach a ""win"" object, but I need to check if that's still the case.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ""key"" located 1 step to the right and 2 steps up. Maybe I need to get the key to unlock a door? But the door is 1 step to the left and 2 steps down. Wait, the ""win"" rule is 7 steps to the right and 3 steps up. That's pretty far. Also, there's a ""rule `you`"" at 3 steps down, which might be important.

The walls are forming a barrier. To move towards the ""win"" position, I might need to navigate around the walls. The ""is"" text blocks are scattered. If I can move one of them, maybe I can change a rule. For example, if I can make ""baba is win,"" then touching the win object would make me win. Alternatively, changing ""you"" to something else might help.

The key is nearby. If I go right twice, I can reach the key at 1 step right and 2 steps up. But moving up might be blocked by walls. Let me check the path. From my current position, moving right once gets me to the ""is"" rule at 7 steps right and 3 up. Then moving right again might hit a wall. Hmm, maybe I need to go down first?

Alternatively, the ""rule `you`"" at 3 steps down. If I can move that ""you"" to attach to ""baba,"" making ""baba is you,"" but that's already the case. Wait, the active rule is already ""baba is you,"" so maybe I need to create a new rule. For example, moving the ""is"" next to ""win"" to make ""win is you,"" so touching the win object would make me the winner. But where is the ""you"" text block? There's a ""rule `you`"" at 1 step left and 3 steps down. If I can move that ""you"" to the ""win"" object, that might work.

So the plan could be: move to the ""you"" rule at 3 steps down, pick it up (since it's not a stop), and then move it to the ""win"" rule which is 7 steps right and 3 steps up. But how to get there? The path seems blocked by walls. Maybe I need to use the key first to unlock a door? The door is at 1 step left and 2 steps down. If I have the key, maybe I can move the door's rule? Not sure.

Alternatively, focus on changing ""baba"" to ""win."" There's a ""rule `baba`"" at 3 steps left and 3 steps down. If I can move that ""baba"" text next to the ""win"" rule, making ""win is baba,"" then since ""baba is you,"" that would mean ""win is you,"" so touching win would make me win. To do that, I need to move the ""baba"" rule to the ""win"" rule's position. But the path is blocked by walls.

Another angle: the ""stop"" rule is at 2 steps up. Maybe I can move that to somewhere else to clear a path. But ""stop"" properties make objects immovable, so I need to avoid moving them unless necessary.

Let me try to outline possible steps:

1. Retrieve the key to potentially unlock a door.
2. Move the ""you"" rule to the ""win"" rule to create ""win is you.""
3. Alternatively, move the ""baba"" rule next to ""win"" to make ""win is baba,"" leveraging ""baba is you.""

Starting with the key: it's 1 step right and 2 steps up. From current position, moving right once gets to the ""is"" rule at 7 steps right, 3 up. Then moving up two steps? But there's a wall at 2 steps up. Maybe I can't go up directly. Alternatively, move left to the key's position. Wait, the key is 2 steps up. Let me check the direction again.

The key is 2 steps up. So from my current position, moving up twice would reach the key. But are there walls in between? The observation shows walls at 2 steps to the right and 2 steps up, 2 steps right and 1 step up, etc. Maybe moving up is possible if there's a clear path.

Alternatively, move left to reach the ""you"" rule at 3 steps down. If I move left, maybe I can pick up the ""you"" rule and then move it to the ""win"" position.

Hmm, this is tricky. Let me try to prioritize. The main goal is to reach ""win,"" but the current rule is ""baba is you."" If I can make ""win is you,"" then touching win would work. To do that, I need to move the ""you"" rule next to ""win."" The ""you"" rule is at 1 step left and 3 steps down. So from my current position, moving left three steps down to reach it. But there are walls blocking the path. Let's see:

Current position: assuming the player is at the origin, based on the objects' relative positions. The ""rule `is`"" is 6 steps right and 3 up, so maybe the player is somewhere else. This is getting complicated without a visual map.

Alternatively, focus on moving the ""is"" text blocks to form new rules. For example, moving ""is"" next to ""win"" and ""you"" to make ""win is you."" The ""you"" is 1 step left and 3 steps down. If I can move that ""you"" to the ""win"" which is 7 steps right and 3 up, that would require a lot of steps. Maybe there's a shorter path.

Alternatively, use the ""key"" to unlock a door. The door is 1 step left and 2 steps down. If I have the key, moving it near the door's rule (which is ""rule `door`"" at 5 steps right and 3 steps down) might not help directly. Maybe the door is locked, and the key opens it. If I can reach the door and use the key, then I can pass through. But the key is 2 steps up, so going there first.

Let me try to map this out step by step:

1. Move up twice to get the key (assuming no walls in the way).
2. Move left to the door (1 step left, 2 steps down).
3. Use the key on the door, allowing passage.
4. Proceed to the win area.

But how to move left and down with the key? Also, the door's rule is at 5 steps right and 3 steps down, which might be a separate object. Not sure if the key interacts with that.

Alternatively, after getting the key, move to the ""you"" rule at 3 steps down, pick it up, and then move it to the ""win"" position. But navigating there might be blocked.

Another thought: The ""rule `baba`"" is at 3 steps left and 3 steps down. If I can move that ""baba"" next to the ""win"" rule, making ""win is baba,"" and since ""baba is you,"" then ""win is you."" So touching win would make me win. To do that, I need to move the ""baba"" rule to the ""win"" location, which is 7 steps right and 3 up. That's a long way, but maybe possible by moving right multiple times, avoiding walls.

But the path seems blocked by walls at 2 steps right and various positions. Maybe there's a way around by moving down or up first.

This is quite complex. Given the time constraints, perhaps the best immediate action is to move towards the ""you"" rule to pick it up and then position it near the ""win"" rule. So from the current observation, the ""you"" rule is 1 step left and 3 steps down. So the action would be to move left three times and down once, but need to check if those steps are possible without hitting walls.

Alternatively, move down to reach the ""you"" rule. The current position might be such that moving down once gets to the ""is"" rule at 1 step right and 1 step down, then moving left to get to the ""you"" rule. But the exact path needs to be deduced.

Given the uncertainty, the next best action might be to move left to reach the ""you"" rule, which is crucial for creating the ""win is you"" rule. So the action would be ""left"".

The player is in a Baba Is You level and needs to figure out the next move. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means the player can move Baba around. The goal is usually to reach a ""win"" object, but that might have been changed. Let me look at the objects on the map.

First, there's a key located 2 steps to the right and 2 steps up. Maybe the player needs to get the key to unlock something, like a door. But looking at the current observation, the door is 2 steps down. Wait, there's a door at 2 steps down, but also a rule `door` at 7 steps to the right and 3 steps down. Not sure if that's relevant yet.

The walls are forming a maze-like structure. To the right, there are multiple walls stepping up and down. The ""rule `is`"" blocks are scattered, which are crucial because they allow the player to create or modify rules by moving them. For example, if the player can move a ""rule `is`"" next to ""baba"" and ""win,"" they could change the win condition.

The key is at 2 steps right and 2 steps up. The player (Baba) is probably at the starting position, which isn't explicitly listed, but based on the walls, maybe centered. To get the key, the player needs to move right and up. But there's a wall 4 steps to the right and 3 steps up, so path might be blocked. Wait, the key is at 2 steps right and 2 steps up. So moving right twice and up twice might be the way. But need to check if there are any stop rules blocking the path.

Looking at the active rules, only ""baba is you"" is present, so the player can move Baba unless there's a ""stop"" rule. The ""stop"" rules are at 1 step to the left and 2 steps up, and 1 step to the right and 2 steps up. So if the player moves towards the key, they might encounter a stop wall. For instance, moving up from the starting position, there's a wall at 2 steps up, but maybe the path is clear.

Alternatively, the player might need to create a new rule to bypass obstacles. For example, if they move the ""rule `is`"" block (which is at 8 steps right and 3 steps up) to combine with other objects. But that would require moving right multiple times, which could be tricky.

Another approach: The door at 2 steps down. If the door is a ""stop"" or requires a key, maybe obtaining the key first is necessary. But the door's rule is at 7 steps right and 3 steps down. If the player can change the door's rule to ""push"" or something else, they might be able to move it.

Wait, the current active rules are only ""baba is you."" So other rules like ""win is door"" or ""key is push"" aren't active. The player might need to create a rule like ""key is you"" to become the key and pick it up, but that would require moving the ""key"" text block. However, the key is an object, not a rule. Maybe not.

Alternatively, the player can move the ""rule `is`"" next to ""baba"" and ""win"" to make ""baba is win,"" making Baba the win condition. But the win rule is at 9 steps right and 3 steps up, which is far away. Moving there would require overcoming the walls.

Looking at the latest observation, the wall 4 steps to the right and 3 steps up might be a barrier. The player is probably near the left side, given the walls on the right. The ""rule `is`"" at 8 steps right and 3 steps up is close to the rightmost wall. Maybe moving left towards the key is better.

The key is at 2 steps right and 2 steps up. So from the current position (assuming the player is at the origin), moving right twice and up twice. But need to check the path. Between the starting point and the key, there's a wall at 2 steps up (rule `stop` at 1 step right and 2 steps up). So moving up first might hit a stop wall. Hmm.

Alternatively, move right first to avoid the stop wall. If the player moves right to step 1, then up to step 2, but there's a wall at 2 steps up. Wait, the walls are at 2 steps up, 3 steps up, etc. Maybe the player needs to navigate around the walls using the ""is"" rules to create new rules.

Another idea: Move the ""rule `is`"" block to the left to create a new rule. For example, moving it to where ""baba"" and ""key"" are, making ""baba is key,"" allowing the player to pick up the key by moving onto it. But the key is an object, not a text block. Maybe that's not possible.

Alternatively, create ""key is you"" so the player can become the key and move it. But again, the key is an object, not a rule. The rules are ""baba is you,"" ""is"" at various positions, ""win,"" ""wall,"" and ""stop.""

The door is at 2 steps down. If the player can make the door a ""push"" or remove the ""stop"" rule from the walls, they might pass through. But how?

Wait, the ""rule `stop`"" is at 1 step left and 2 steps up, and 1 step right and 2 steps up. If the player can move these ""stop"" rules away, the path might clear. But to move them, the player needs to be adjacent and not blocked.

Alternatively, use the ""is"" rule to create a new rule that negates ""stop."" For example, ""stop is nothing,"" but that would require placing ""stop"" next to ""nothing,"" which isn't present.

This is getting complicated. Let's recap:

- Player is Baba, can move anywhere except STOP.
- Goal is probably WIN, which is a door or somewhere else.
- Key is nearby, might be needed to unlock the door.
- Many walls and STOPs blocking the path.
- IS rules are available to create new rules.

Possible steps:

1. Move right to reach the key, but avoid STOP walls.
2. Use an IS rule to create a new rule that allows passing through walls or stops.
3. Retrieve the key and use it to open the door.
4. Change the WIN condition to Baba or something else reachable.

Looking at the current position, the player might be near the lower left part of the map. The door is 2 steps down, which is close. But how to get there? There's a wall at 4 steps right and 2 steps down, but the door is at 2 steps down, not sure about the exact position.

Alternatively, focus on creating ""baba is win"" by moving the WIN rule to be next to Baba using an IS rule. The WIN rule is at 9 steps right and 3 steps up. That's far, but maybe possible by moving right and up, avoiding walls.

But the walls are dense on the right. The player might need to go around to the left side. The ""rule `baba`"" is at 1 step left and 3 steps down. Maybe combining that with an IS rule to make ""baba is you"" again, but it's already active.

Another angle: The ""rule `you`"" is at 1 step right and 3 steps down. If the player can move that to be next to Baba, making ""baba is you"" again, but that's redundant.

Wait, the active rule is already ""baba is you,"" so no need. Maybe the player needs to create ""win is door"" to make the door the win condition. The door's rule is at 7 steps right and 3 steps down. So moving the IS rule (which is at 8 steps right and 3 steps up) to position it between ""win"" and ""door"" to create ""win is door."" But that would require moving the IS block left and down, which might be possible.

Alternatively, move the IS block from 8 steps right and 3 steps up to 7 steps right and 3 steps down, placing it between WIN (9 steps right, 3 steps up) and door (7 steps right, 3 steps down). Not sure.

This is quite intricate. Maybe the immediate step is to move towards the key to get it, then use the key to open the door. To get the key at 2 steps right and 2 steps up, the player needs to move right twice and up twice. But there's a wall at 2 steps up (rule `stop` at 1 step right and 2 steps up). So moving up from the starting position, step by step:

- Move right to step 1.
- Move up to step 2 (but there's a wall at 2 steps up, which is a STOP. So can't move through it unless the rule is changed.

Ah, right, the STOP rule makes those walls immovable. So the player can't pass through them. Therefore, cannot go directly right and up.

Alternative path: Move up first, then right. But the wall at 2 steps up is a STOP. So moving up to step 2 would hit a STOP, which the player can't bypass without changing the rule.

So the player needs to alter the STOP rule. For example, create ""stop is nothing"" or remove the STOP property. To do that, the player would need to move the ""rule `stop`"" text block to a position where it's no longer a rule. Or move another IS block to redefine it.

The ""rule `stop`"" is at 1 step left and 2 steps up, and 1 step right and 2 steps up. If the player can move one of these STOP rules away, then the path might clear.

Let's focus on the STOP at 1 step right and 2 steps up. To move it, the player needs to be adjacent to it and move it in a direction. Since the player is likely near the lower part, moving up to that position.

Path to reach the STOP rule at 1 step right and 2 steps up:

- From starting position (assumed to be near the lower left), move right once, then up twice. But there's a wall at 2 steps up (the STOP itself). So can't get past it.

Alternatively, find another path. Maybe move left to avoid the wall, but the other STOP is at 1 step left and 2 steps up. So similar issue.

This seems tricky. Maybe the player needs to use an IS rule to create a new rule that allows moving through STOPs. For example, ""stop is push"" or ""stop is you."" But how?

If the player can move an IS block next to the STOP rule and another object, they can create a new rule. For instance, move the IS block at 8 steps right and 3 steps up to be next to STOP and, say, BABA, making ""stop is baba."" Then, since the player is Baba, they could move through STOPs. But this requires navigating to that IS block, which is far to the right.

Alternatively, use the IS block at 7 steps right and 3 steps up (near the WIN rule) to create a rule like ""win is door,"" making the door the win condition. Then, head towards the door at 2 steps down.

But the door is at 2 steps down, which is closer. How to get there? The path might be blocked by walls, but if the player can make the door a PUSH or remove its STOP property.

Another angle: The key is at 2 steps right and 2 steps up. If the player can retrieve the key, maybe they can use it to unlock the door. But how? The door's rule is at 7 steps right and 3 steps down. If the key is an object, perhaps creating ""key is door"" to unlock it. But that would require placing the key next to the door and using an IS rule.

This is getting too convoluted. Let's try to prioritize immediate actions.

The closest reachable IS block is at 7 steps right and 3 steps up (near the WIN rule). If the player moves there, they can potentially create a new rule. But moving right 7 times and up 3 times is a long way, considering the walls.

Alternatively, move to the IS block at 6 steps right and 3 steps up (another one). Still far.

Maybe the best bet is to move towards the key, avoiding the STOP walls by changing rules on the fly. For example, move the IS block at 8 steps right and 3 steps up to create a new rule that allows passage.

But this requires precise movement. Let's outline steps:

1. Move right to reach the IS block at 8 steps right, 3 steps up.
2. Move down to align it with a relevant object, like the STOP rule.
3. Combine them to create a rule that removes STOP.

Alternatively, create ""baba is win"" by moving the IS block next to Baba and the WIN rule.

Assuming the player is at the starting point (near the lower left), moving right and down might be better. The door is at 2 steps down, which is close. If the player can move down twice, they reach the door. But there's a wall at 4 steps right and 2 steps down. So unless they can move that wall or change its rule, they can't pass.

Wait, the rule `is` at 3 steps right and 1 step down could be used. If the player moves that IS block next to the wall at 4 steps right and 2 steps down, they could create a rule like ""wall is nothing,"" removing it. But how to get there?

This is really complex. Maybe the immediate action is to move right towards the key, hoping to find a path. Let's try:

Action: right

But the previous attempts resulted in failures. Maybe the assistant needs to think differently.

Wait, in the latest observation, after moving left and right several times, the wall positions have shifted. The current wall at 4 steps right and 3 steps up might have changed based on previous movements. But without knowing the player's exact position, it's hard to track.

Alternatively, focus on the door. If the player can make the door a ""push"" or remove its ""stop"" property, they can move it. The rule `door` is at 7 steps right and 3 steps down. If the player can move an IS block next to door and, say, BABA, creating ""door is baba,"" then pushing the door might be possible. But the player needs to be adjacent to the door and have the right rules.

Another possibility: Use the key to unlock the door. If the door requires a key, the player must pick it up. To get the key, they need to move right and up, but avoiding STOPs. Maybe using the IS block to create a rule that allows moving through STOPs.

For example, create ""stop is you"" by moving an IS block next to STOP and YOU. The YOU rule is at 1 step right and 3 steps down. So if the player can move the IS block to that area, they could make ""stop is you,"" making the player able to pass through STOPs.

This would require navigating to the YOU rule's location. Let's see:

The player needs to move down to 3 steps down, right to 1 step right. But there are walls at 4 steps right and 3 steps down. So maybe move left instead.

Alternatively, move the IS block from 8 steps right and 3 steps up to 1 step right and 3 steps down, positioning it between STOP and YOU. But this is a lot of movement.

Given the time constraints and the complexity, perhaps the best immediate action is to move left or right to reach a closer IS block and start creating new rules. For example, moving right to reach the IS block at 6 steps right and 3 steps up, then using it to redefine WIN or STOP.

But without knowing the exact player position, it's hard to say. The assistant needs to make a best guess based on the latest observation.

In the latest observation, after several left and right moves, the walls have shifted. The player might be near the left side, given the wall at 1 step left and 3 steps down. The rule `baba` is at 2 steps left and 3 steps down. Maybe combining that with an IS block to reinforce ""baba is you.""

Alternatively, the player needs to move towards the key at 2 steps right and 2 steps up. Let's try moving right twice and up twice, but avoiding STOPs. If the player moves right once, then up once, but hits a STOP, they need to alter the rule.

Another approach: Move the IS block at 7 steps right and 3 steps up (near the WIN rule) down to create ""win is door."" To do that, move the IS block left and down, placing it between WIN and door. For example, move left from 7 steps right to 6, then down to 2 steps down, positioning it between WIN (9 right, 3 up) and door (7 right, 3 down). Not sure.

This is really challenging. Given the previous failures, maybe the assistant needs to try a different action. Looking at the latest observation, the player might be able to move down towards the door at 2 steps down. The door is a possible WIN if the rule is changed. So action: down

But the door is at 2 steps down. If the player moves down twice, they reach there. Let's check the path. From the starting position (assuming near the upper left), moving down twice would require passing through walls. But the walls at 2 steps down might be STOPs. If the player can change the door's rule to be WIN, then reaching it would solve the level.

Alternatively, move towards the rule `is` at 7 steps right and 3 steps up to create a new rule. But that's a long move.

Given the time I've spent and the previous failures, I'll choose to move right to reach the key and then figure out the rest.

Let's try to figure out how to solve this Baba Is You level. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I can move Baba around. My goal is usually to reach the ""win"" object, which is likely a door or something similar. But I need to check the current setup.

Looking at the objects on the map:

- There's a key at 1 step to the right and 2 steps up. Maybe I need to get that first to unlock a door?
- The door is at 1 step to the left and 2 steps down. But right now, the door might be ""stop"" or blocked by walls.
- There are several ""is"" rules scattered around. The key is near a rule `is` at 7 steps to the right and 1 step down. If I can move that `is` rule, maybe I can create a new rule like ""key is win"" or ""door is you,"" which would change the game dynamics.

Wait, the current active rules only have ""baba is you."" All other rules are text blocks that I can potentially move if they're not marked as ""stop."" The ""stop"" rule is at 2 steps up, so that text block and any walls connected to it can't be moved. 

If I can get to the `is` rule at 7 steps to the right and 1 step down, I could move it to create a new rule. For example, combining it with the key or door. But how to get there? Let's see the positions:

- My current position isn't specified, but the active rules and objects are listed. Assuming I'm at Baba's position, which is likely near the `baba` rule at 2 steps to the left and 3 steps down. 

To reach the `is` rule at 7 steps right and 3 step up, I need to move right multiple times. But there are walls blocking the path. The walls are at 3 steps right and 3 step up, and others. So maybe I need to rearrange the rules to remove obstacles.

Alternatively, the `key` is at 1 step right and 2 step up. If I can pick up the key by moving towards it, but since I'm Baba (you), I can move over objects unless they're ""stop."" The walls are ""wall"" which are probably stop unless the rule says otherwise. But the current rule is only ""baba is you,"" so walls are stop. So I can't walk through walls.

Looking at the map layout:

- Upwards, there's a wall at 3 steps right and 3 step up, which is a stop. So moving up directly isn't possible. Maybe I need to use the `is` rules to create a new path.

The `is` rule at 7 steps right and 3 step up could be moved. If I can get there and combine it with another rule, like making ""wall is stop"" into something else, but right now the rules are:

- wall is you (no, the current rules are baba is you, wall is wall, etc.)

Wait, the objects list includes rule `wall` at 3 step left and 2 step up. So that's a text block saying ""wall is ... something?"" But the active rules only show ""baba is you."" The other rules are present on the map but not active until rearranged.

So the plan might be:

1. Move to the `is` rule at 7 steps right and 3 step up.
2. Combine it with another rule to create a new rule, like ""door is you"" or ""key is win.""
3. Then interact with the door or key accordingly.

But how to get to that `is` rule? The path is blocked by walls. Maybe I need to move some walls by redefining their properties. For example, if I can change ""wall is stop"" to ""wall is nothing,"" then the walls wouldn't block me.

Looking at the objects, there's a rule `wall` at 3 step left and 2 step up. That's probably a text block saying ""wall is stop."" If I can move that `wall` rule and combine it with an `is` rule to change its property.

Alternatively, use the existing `is` rules to create ""wall is push"" or something, but I don't see a push rule here.

Another approach: The key is near a rule `is` at 7 steps right and 1 step down. If I can move that `is` to the key, creating ""key is win,"" then grabbing the key would make me win. But I need to reach that `is` rule first.

But movement is restricted by walls. Let's map out the possible path:

Starting from Baba's position (assuming it's at rule `baba` at 3 step left and 3 steps down), I need to move right and down. But there are walls to the right. Maybe moving left towards the `is` rule at 1 step right and 1 step down.

Wait, the `is` rule is at 1 step right and 1 step down from the current position? Let me check:

The current observation lists objects relative to Baba's position. For example, ""rule `is` 1 step to the right and 1 step down"" means that rule is one step right and one down from where I am.

If that's the case, then moving right once would reach that `is` rule. Then, if I can move that `is` rule to combine with the key or door.

But how to pick up the `is` rule? Since I'm Baba (you), I can move over it unless it's stopped. But the `is` rule itself isn't stopped unless there's a ""stop"" rule on it. The closest ""stop"" rule is at 2 step up, which is two steps up from here, so not blocking this `is` rule.

So, possible steps:

1. Move right to reach the `is` rule at 1 step right and 1 step down.
2. Then, move that `is` rule to the key's location (6 steps right and 1 step down) to create ""key is win.""
3. Once ""key is win"" is active, picking up the key would make me win.

But how to move the `is` rule? Since I'm Baba, I can push text blocks unless they're stopped. The `is` rule isn't stopped, so I can move it by walking into it and then moving in the desired direction, carrying it with me.

So, action sequence:

- Move right once to get to the `is` rule.
- Then, move right again while carrying the `is` rule to the key's location.
- Place the `is` next to the key to form ""key is win.""
- Now, grab the key (since I'm you), and go to the door, which might now be a win condition if I changed it.

Alternatively, create ""door is you"" so that standing on the door wins.

But the door is at 1 step left and 2 steps down. To reach there, maybe after moving the `is` rule, create ""door is you"" and then move to the door.

Another thing to consider: there's a rule `you` at 1 step left and 3 steps down. If I can move that `you` rule to Baba, making ""baba is you"" (which is already active) or changing it to ""door is you.""

But the `you` rule is three steps down and left from the current position. To get there, need to navigate through walls, which might be possible if I rearrange other rules.

Alternatively, focus on the key first. Let's try that path.

Current position: Assume I'm at the same position as the `baba` rule, which is 3 steps left and 3 steps down.

Objects relative to me:

- rule `is` is 1 step right, 1 step down.
- key is 2 steps up.
- door is 2 steps left, 2 steps down.

But walls block the way. For example, moving up would hit a wall at 3 steps right and 3 step up. So need to find another way.

Moving right towards the `is` rule at 1 step right, 1 step down. Let's do that.

Action: right

Now, at the `is` rule. Then, move right again to carry it to the key's location (6 steps right and 1 step down). Wait, the key is at 2 steps up. Maybe I need to move the `is` rule up instead.

Alternatively, place the `is` next to the key to make ""key is win.""

But the key is at 2 steps up. From the `is` rule's position (1 step right, 1 step down), moving up would reach the key's area. But there's a wall at 3 steps right and 2 step up, which is blocking.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe another approach: use the existing `is` rules to redefine the door.

There's a rule `door` at 5 steps right and 3 steps down. If I can make ""door is you,"" then standing on the door would win. To do that, I need to move the `you` rule (which is at 1 step left and 3 steps down) next to the `door` rule and the `is` rule.

So, steps:

1. Move left to the `you` rule at 1 step left and 3 steps down.
2. Move up or right to position the `you` rule alongside the `door` and `is` rules.
3. Create ""door is you"" by placing `you` next to `door` and `is`.

But how to navigate there without hitting walls. There's a wall at 2 steps left and 2 steps up, which might block movement.

Alternatively, use the `is` rule at 7 steps right and 3 step up to create a new rule. But reaching there is tough due to walls.

Maybe the key is the priority. Let's try to get the key first.

From the current position, move right to the `is` rule at 1 step right, 1 step down.

Action: right

Now, carrying the `is` rule. Move up to reach the key's location (2 steps up). But there's a wall at 3 steps right and 2 step up. So, can't go that way.

Alternatively, move the `is` rule to the key's position. The key is at 2 steps up, so from the `is` rule's position (1 step right, 1 step down), moving up two steps would reach the key. But there's a wall in the way.

Wait, the key is at 1 step to the right and 2 step up. So relative to the current position (after moving right once to the `is` rule), the key is up two steps and same x.

But there's a wall at 3 steps right and 2 step up. So the path is blocked. Maybe I need to move that wall's rule.

The `wall` rule is at 3 step left and 2 step up. That's a text block saying ""wall is stop."" If I can move that `wall` rule and change its property.

For example, move the `wall` rule to the `is` rule to create ""wall is push"" or something. But that requires having an `is` rule nearby.

This is getting quite complex. Maybe the simplest way is to create ""key is win"" by moving the `is` rule to the key.

The key is at 1 step right and 2 step up. From the `is` rule's position (1 step right, 1 step down), moving up two steps and left zero steps would reach the key. But there's a wall at 3 steps right and 2 step up, which is two steps to the right from the current position. Wait, no, the current position after moving right once is 1 step right. The wall is at 3 steps right and 2 step up, which is two steps to the right and two up. So the path is blocked.

Alternative plan: Use the `is` rule at 7 steps right and 3 step up. If I can move there, maybe create a rule like ""door is you.""

But how to get there. From the current position, moving right seven times would reach that `is` rule, but there are walls along the way. Specifically, walls at 3 steps right and various positions. So movement is blocked.

Another angle: The door is at 1 step left and 2 steps down. If I can make the door a ""win"" by creating ""door is win,"" then standing on it would win. To do that, need an `is` rule next to door and win.

The `win` rule is at 8 steps right and 3 step up. That's far away. Not sure.

Alternatively, use the existing `win` rule. If I can move it to the door's location, but that's also difficult due to walls.

Wait, the `win` rule is at 7 steps right and 3 step up. Maybe combine that with the door.

This is really tricky. Maybe the key is the key to unlock the door. If I can get the key and then the door becomes accessible.

But to get the key, need to move past the wall at 3 steps right and 2 step up. How?

If I can change the wall's property from ""stop"" to something else. The `wall` rule is at 3 step left and 2 step up. So it's a text block saying ""wall is stop."" If I can move that `wall` rule and change it to ""wall is push"" or remove it, then the wall wouldn't block.

To do that, I need to move the `wall` rule to an `is` rule. For example, move the `wall` rule next to an `is` rule and another rule to create a new definition.

But this requires navigating to that `wall` rule's location. From the current position, it's 3 steps left and 2 steps up. Moving left three times and up two times, but there are obstacles.

This seems too complicated. Maybe the intended solution is to move the `is` rule next to the `key` to make ""key is win.""

So, steps:

1. Move right to the `is` rule at 1 step right, 1 step down.
2. Move up twice to reach the key's location (since the key is 2 steps up from the `is` rule's position).
   - But there's a wall at 3 steps right and 2 step up. So can't go that way.
   
Alternative route from the `is` rule:

Move right and up. From the `is` rule's position (1R, 1D), move right to 2R, 1D. Then up to 2R, 0D. Then up again to 2R, 1U. But the key is at 1R, 2U. So not directly reachable.

Hmm. Maybe this level requires creating ""you"" as door or something. Since the `you` rule is at 1 step left and 3 steps down, which is below the current position.

If I can move the `you` rule to the door's location, then standing on the door would make me win.

To do that:

1. Move left to the `you` rule at 1L, 3D.
2. Move up two steps to reach the door's location (1L, 1D) and then right to door's position (0L, 1D)? Not sure about the coordinates.

This is getting too confusing without a visual. Let's try to think of the most straightforward action based on previous steps.

The last action was left, which might have moved Baba left. The previous observation showed that moving left changed the map slightly. Maybe the key is nearby, and picking it up is necessary.

But the key is at 2 steps up. If I can move up, but there's a wall. Unless I can redefine the wall.

Alternatively, use the `is` rule to create ""key is you,"" making the key act like Baba. Then, pick up the key and move it to the door.

But I'm not sure. Given the time I've spent and the previous failed attempts, maybe the correct action now is to move right towards the `is` rule to manipulate it further.

20,right,"<reasoning>
Let me try to figure out how to solve this Baba Is You level. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" so I can move Baba around, right? The goal is usually to reach the object defined as ""win,"" which is a door here located at 7 steps to the right and 3 steps up. But maybe I need to change some rules to get past the walls and the stop blocks.

Looking at the objects, there's a key at 2 steps up. Maybe I need to pick that up first to unlock something. But the path to the key is blocked by walls. Wait, the rules mention ""stop"" at 1 step to the left and 2 steps up. If I can move that ""stop"" rule somewhere else, maybe I can walk through the wall. But how?

The ""is"" blocks are movable because they aren't marked as stop. So, if I can grab the ""is"" block that's 6 steps to the right and 3 steps up and drag it to modify a rule. For example, if I make ""wall is stop,"" then the walls would become stop blocks, but that might not help. Alternatively, changing ""baba is you"" to something else... Wait, no, the initial rule is ""baba is you,"" so if I move that ""is"" block and create a new rule like ""baba is win,"" then I would become the win condition, allowing me to step on the door directly. That could work!

But how do I move the ""is"" block? Let me check the positions. The ""is"" block is 6 steps to the right and 3 steps up. Right now, I'm assuming I'm positioned somewhere on the map. The key is at 2 steps up, and the door is to the right. The walls are forming a barrier. Maybe I need to first get to the ""is"" block by moving right. But the path might be blocked by walls. Let me see the layout:

- There's a row of walls two steps to the right starting from up to down. So moving right directly might hit those walls. The ""is"" block is further to the right at 6 steps, but there are walls blocking the path. Maybe I need to use the key to unlock a door, but the door is 2 steps to the left and 2 steps down. Wait, the door's position is 2 steps to the left and 2 steps down from where? Maybe from Baba's current position.

Alternatively, if I can create a rule that makes the door a ""win"" by moving the ""win"" rule to the door's location. The current ""win"" rule is at 7 steps right and 3 steps up. If I can move that ""win"" block to the door's position (which is at 2 steps left and 2 steps down relative to the ""win"" block's current location?), that might make the door the win condition. But how do I know the exact positions?

This is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to outline the possible steps:

1. Move the ""is"" block to rewrite a rule. For example, take the ""is"" at 6 right, 3 up and move it to combine with ""baba"" and ""you"" to create ""baba is you"" again, but that's redundant. Maybe create ""key is win"" so grabbing the key makes me win. But I need to be able to pick up the key first.

2. To pick up the key, which is at 2 steps up, I might need to move around the walls. The walls are two steps to the right from up to down. So maybe move up to reach the key, but there's a wall at 2 steps right and 2 steps up. Wait, the key is at 2 step up. Let me check the objects again:

- key 2 step up
- wall 2 steps to the right and 2 step up
- wall 2 steps to the right and 1 step up
- wall 2 steps to the right

So the key is at 2 steps up, but there's a wall at 2 steps right and 2 steps up. That means I can't walk over the wall to get the key. Unless I can move the wall's rule. The ""wall"" rule is at 3 steps left and 2 steps up. If I can move that ""wall"" rule away, then the wall at 2 steps right and 2 steps up would no longer be a wall. So, grab the ""wall"" rule (which is a text block) and move it somewhere else. For example, move it to the ground to make it not a rule anymore, thus removing the wall.

But how to move the ""wall"" rule? The ""wall"" rule is at 3 steps left and 2 steps up. So from my current position, which I'm not sure of, but assuming I'm near the center, I need to navigate to that ""wall"" rule. Let's see:

If I move left three steps to reach the ""wall"" rule at 3 steps left and 2 steps up. But there's a ""stop"" rule at 1 step left and 2 steps up. So maybe I can't move left past that. The ""stop"" rule makes whatever it's attached to immovable. The ""stop"" is at 1 step left and 2 steps up. If that's a text block, can I move it? Since it's labeled ""stop,"" maybe it's making another object stop. But the rule itself is movable unless it's part of a ""stop"" property.

This is getting complicated. Let me think differently. The goal is to reach the door, which is the win condition. The door is at 2 steps left and 2 steps down. But there's a ""door"" rule at 5 steps right and 3 steps down. So the actual door object is at 2 steps left and 2 steps down. To get there, I need to move past walls and stops.

Another approach: Make Baba into the key. If I can create a rule ""baba is key,"" then stepping on the key would make me win. But the key is at 2 steps up. So move right and up to get to the key, but the path is blocked. Alternatively, move the ""key"" rule to Baba. The ""key"" rule is at 6 steps right and 1 step down. So if I can move that ""key"" rule onto Baba, then ""baba is key,"" and then stepping on any key would make me win. But how to reach the ""key"" rule?

Alternatively, create ""win is door"" by moving the ""win"" rule to the door's location. The current ""win"" is at 7 right, 3 up. The door is at 2 left, 2 down. So I need to move the ""win"" rule from 7r3u to 2l2d. To do that, I have to grab the ""win"" rule (which is a text block) and drag it to the door's position. But how to get there? There are walls blocking the path.

Maybe the solution is to first remove the walls by moving their rules. For example, the ""wall"" rule is at 3 left 2 up. If I move that rule to the ground, the wall at 2r2u would no longer exist. So, move the ""wall"" rule (the text block) from 3l2u to, say, 1r2u, which is the position of the ""stop"" rule. Then, the wall at 2r2u is gone, allowing passage to the key.

But how to move the ""wall"" rule? I need to be adjacent to it. If I move left three steps to reach 3l2u, but there's a ""stop"" at 1l2u. So perhaps I can move around that. Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at 1 step left and 2 steps up. If I can move that ""stop"" rule away, maybe I can get past it. But ""stop"" rules make objects immovable. If the ""stop"" is on a text block, can I move the text block?

This is getting too tangled. Let me try to outline the steps again:

1. Find the ""is"" blocks to create new rules.
2. The key is at 2 steps up but blocked by a wall. Remove the wall's rule.
3. Move the ""wall"" rule (text block) from 3l2u to another position to eliminate the wall.
4. Once the wall is gone, move up to grab the key.
5. Use the key to unlock the door, or create a rule that makes Baba the key or the door the win.

Alternatively, create ""baba is win"" by moving the ""win"" rule to Baba's position. But I need to be Baba (which I am, since ""baba is you"") and then move the ""win"" rule onto myself. So, grab the ""win"" rule at 7r3u and move it to where Baba is. That way, ""baba is win,"" and stepping on the door would make me win.

But how to reach the ""win"" rule? There are walls blocking the path. So first, remove the walls by moving their rules. Let's try that.

First, locate the ""wall"" rule at 3l2u. Move it to a different spot. To do that, I need to be next to it. If I move left three steps, but there's a ""stop"" at 1l2u. The ""stop"" rule is at 1 step left and 2 steps up. If that's a text block labeled ""stop,"" it might be attached to another object, making that object immovable. But maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule itself. If I move the ""stop"" rule away, the object it was affecting would no longer be stopped.

So, the plan is:

- Move the ""stop"" rule from 1l2u to somewhere else, say 1l3u.
- Then move the ""wall"" rule from 3l2u to, say, 3l3u, removing the wall at 2r2u.

Once the walls are gone, I can path to the ""win"" rule at 7r3u, grab it, and move it to my position to become the win condition.

But how to execute this step by step? Let's see:

1. Move left three times to reach the ""wall"" rule at 3l2u. But there's a ""stop"" at 1l2u blocking the path. So first, need to move the ""stop"" rule.

2. To move the ""stop"" rule at 1l2u, I have to be adjacent to it. Suppose I'm at position (0,0). The ""stop"" is at (-1, 2). To get there, move left once to (-1,0), then up two steps to (-1,2). But moving up might be blocked by walls. Wait, the walls are at 2r2u, but that's on the other side.

Alternatively, maybe my current position is near the center. Let me assume I'm at the position where the ""baba"" rule is at 3l3d. Not sure. This is getting too unclear without knowing Baba's exact position.

Alternatively, focus on moving the ""is"" blocks to create new rules. For example, take the ""is"" at 6r3u and combine it with ""baba"" and ""win"" to make ""baba is win."" But to do that, I need to move the ""is"" block to adjacent objects.

The ""baba"" rule is at 3l3d. The ""win"" rule is at 7r3u. The ""is"" block is at 6r3u. So if I move the ""is"" block from 6r3u to between ""baba"" and ""win,"" that would create ""baba is win."" But how to navigate there?

The path from 6r3u to 3l3d is blocked by walls. So first, remove the walls by moving their rules. This seems like the key step.

So, step-by-step:

1. Move the ""stop"" rule at 1l2u to a different location. For example, move it down to 1l2u-1d (1l3u). This would make the object it was stopping no longer stopped, allowing movement through that area.

2. Then, move the ""wall"" rule at 3l2u to a different spot, say 3l3u, removing the wall at 2r2u.

3. Now, navigate from the starting position to the ""win"" rule at 7r3u, avoiding the moved walls.

4. Once at 7r3u, grab the ""win"" rule and move it to where Baba is, say 3l3d, creating ""baba is win.""

5. Now, simply move towards the door (which is the win condition) and stand on it to win.

Alternatively, if the door is already a win because of the new rule, just standing on it would suffice.

But this requires precise movement and ensuring that all steps are possible without getting blocked by other rules or objects.

Another angle: The door is at 2l2d. If I can make the door into the win condition by moving the ""win"" rule there, that would work. The ""win"" rule is at 7r3u. To move it to 2l2d, I need to carry it there, which requires a path.

But the path from 7r3u to 2l2d is blocked by walls on the right side. So removing those walls first is necessary.

Overall, the critical step is removing the walls by moving their rules. Once that's done, the rest is straightforward.

So, the actions needed are:

- Move left to reach the ""stop"" rule at 1l2u, then move it down.

- Move left further to reach the ""wall"" rule at 3l2u, then move it down.

- Then navigate to the ""win"" rule and move it to the door's location.

But how to execute this in the game? Each move requires checking the adjacent objects and ensuring that you can move them (i.e., they're not stopped).

Given the previous failures where the assistant kept choosing left or right but the game defaulted to idle, maybe the correct sequence is to first move left to reach the ""stop"" rule, then down, then left again to the ""wall"" rule, move it, then go right to the ""win"" rule, and move it to the door.

But without knowing the exact positions and Baba's starting location, it's challenging. However, based on the observations, the latest one shows the ""win"" rule at 7r3u, and the door at 2l2d. The ""is"" blocks are scattered, so the key is to use them to rewrite the rules.

Final decision: The most promising action is to move the ""is"" block to rewrite a rule. For example, take the ""is"" at 6r3u and move it next to ""baba"" and ""win"" to make ""baba is win."" To do that, need to navigate to that ""is"" block.

But the path is blocked by walls. So first, remove the walls by moving their rules. The ""wall"" rule is at 3l2u. Move it to 3l3u. Then move right to reach the ""is"" block at 6r3u, then move it to combine with ""baba"" and ""win.""

Assuming the assistant's previous actions were moving left and right without success, maybe the correct move now is to move right towards the ""is"" block at 6r3u to create the new rule.

Let's see. The current active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I can move Baba around. The goal is usually to reach a ""win"" object, but I need to check if that's still the case.

Looking at the objects, there's a ""door"" nearby at 3 steps left and 2 steps down. But doors are usually blocked unless there's a matching key. I don't see a key nearby here. Wait, there's a key at 1 step left and 2 steps up. Maybe I need to get that first.

But how do I get to the key? The path might be blocked by walls. Let's check the map. To the left, there's a wall 4 steps left at 2 steps up. But the key is at 1 step left and 2 steps up. So maybe I can move left towards the key. Let's see the current position. If I'm at the original position (assuming Baba starts somewhere), but the observation doesn't specify my position. Hmm, maybe I need to infer based on the objects. The ""rule `baba`"" is at 4 steps left and 3 steps down. Wait, no—the rules are separate. The ""rule `baba`"" object is at 4 steps left and 3 steps down, which probably means that to make Baba part of a rule, I need to move the ""baba"" text block.

Wait, the active rules are only ""baba is you."" The other rules like ""rule `baba`"" are separate objects on the map that I can move if they're not stopped. So maybe I need to rearrange the rules to change the properties.

Looking at the objects, there's a ""rule `is`"" at 5 steps right and 3 steps up. If I can move that ""is"" next to the ""rule `baba`"" at 4 steps left and 3 steps down, I could create a new rule like ""baba is win"" or something else. But first, I need to see if I can move those text blocks.

The ""rule `is`"" is at 5 steps right, 3 up. To get there, I might need to move right. But there's a wall at 1 step right and 3 up. Wait, the wall is 1 step right and 3 up, which is blocking the path. So maybe I can't go directly right. Alternatively, maybe I can move down to reach the ""is"" rule.

Wait, the current position of Baba isn't specified. This is a bit confusing. Maybe I need to assume Baba is at the position where the ""rule `baba`"" object is, which is 4 steps left and 3 steps down. But that might not be the case. Alternatively, perhaps the player's position is inferred from the objects' positions relative to each other.

Alternatively, maybe the goal is to reach the ""win"" rule at 6 steps right and 3 steps up. But to get there, there are walls blocking the path. The ""rule `is`"" is at 5 steps right and 3 up, which is one step left of the ""win"" rule. So if I can move the ""is"" next to ""win,"" I could create a new rule like ""something is win."" But since the current rule is ""baba is you,"" maybe I need to become the win object.

Alternatively, the key is at 1 step left and 2 steps up. To get there, I need to move left twice and up once. But there's a wall at 4 steps left and 2 steps up. Wait, no—the wall is 4 steps left and 2 steps up, which is further left than the key. So the key is at 1 step left, 2 steps up. If I move left from my current position, I can reach the key. But I need to know where I'm starting.

This is getting a bit complicated. Let's try to outline the steps:

1. The goal is typically to reach the ""win"" object, but maybe that's been changed.
2. There's a key nearby that might be needed to open a door.
3. The ""rule `you`"" is at 2 steps left and 3 steps down. If I can attach ""you"" to Baba, that would make me the you, so I can move.
4. Currently, ""baba is you"" is active, so Baba is you. So movement is allowed.
5. The door at 3 steps left and 2 steps down is likely a win condition once unlocked, but it's blocked without a key.

So the immediate plan: get the key at 1 step left and 2 steps up. To do that, move left twice and up once. But check for walls. The path to the key: from current position (unknown), but assuming the key is accessible. Let's see:

If I'm at position (0,0), the key is at (-1, 1) (left 1, up 1). The wall at 4 steps left and 2 steps up is (-4,1), which is further left. So moving left from (0,0) to (-1,0) is possible, then up to (-1,1), which is the key's position. Then pick up the key.

Once I have the key, move to the door at (-3, 2). But there's a wall at (-4,1), but once I have the key, maybe the door can be opened. However, the door's rule is ""rule `door`"" at (4,3) down. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the real win condition is somewhere else. The ""win"" rule is at 6 steps right and 3 steps up. To reach that, there's a wall at 1 step right and 3 up. So maybe need to move the ""is"" rule to combine with ""win"".

If I can move the ""is"" at (5,3) to be next to ""win"" at (6,3), creating ""win is [something]"". But what's the something? Maybe ""key"" or ""door"".

Alternatively, create a rule like ""key is win"" so that picking up the key makes you win. To do that, need to move the ""is"" rule next to ""key"" and ""win"".

The ""key"" is at (-1,1), ""win"" is at (6,3), and ""is"" is at (5,3). So maybe move down to the ""is"" rule at (5,3), then move right to (6,3) to attach with ""win"".

But how to get to the ""is"" rule? Current position is unknown. Assuming I'm near the bottom because the ""rule `baba`"" is at (4,-3) (4 steps left, 3 steps down). So maybe I'm starting near there.

This is getting too ambiguous without knowing the player's exact position. But given the last few observations, in the previous steps, the agent was moving left and right, and the environment was shifting (walls moving right each time), suggesting that the level is changing, perhaps as a result of previous actions.

In the latest observation, the walls have shifted further to the right compared to previous steps. The ""win"" rule is now at 6 steps right, and the ""is"" rules are also further right. The key is now at 1 step left and 2 steps up, which is closer to the player's possible position.

Given that the agent was previously moving left and right, perhaps the correct approach is to continue moving right to reach the ""is"" rule and manipulate the rules.

Looking at the current objects:

- ""rule `is`"" is at 5 steps right and 3 steps up.
- ""win"" is at 6 steps right and 3 steps up.
- The player (Baba) is likely near the ""rule `baba`"" at 4 steps left and 3 steps down, but that's a text block, not the player's position.

Wait, the player's position isn't directly listed. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" so the player is controlled by the Baba object. The Baba object's position is indicated by the ""rule `baba`"" at 4 steps left and 3 steps down. So the player is at (4,-3) if we consider that coordinate.

From there, to reach the ""is"" rule at (5,3), the player needs to move right 9 steps and up 6 steps. That's a long way, and there are walls blocking the path. For example, at 1 step right and 3 up, there's a wall. So the path is blocked.

Alternative approach: create a new rule that makes walls stop being stop, allowing movement through them. For example, ""stop is nothing"" or ""wall is you"". But to do that, need to move the ""is"" rule next to the appropriate text blocks.

Alternatively, make the door a win condition. If I can create ""door is win"", then reaching the door would make me win. The door is at (-3,2) relative to the player's position (4,-3). So moving left 7 steps and up 5 steps. Again, walls are in the way.

Alternatively, use the key to open the door. If I pick up the key at (-1,1), then move to the door at (-3,2), but there's a wall at (-4,1), which is further left. So path might be blocked.

This is really tricky. Maybe the solution is to move the ""is"" rule to combine with ""baba"" and ""win"". For example, creating ""baba is win"", so that touching the win object makes me win. The ""rule `baba`"" is at (4,-3), and ""win"" is at (6,3). The ""is"" rule is at (5,3). So if I can move the ""is"" from (5,3) to between ""baba"" and ""win"", creating ""baba is win"".

To do that, the player needs to move the ""is"" rule. The ""is"" rule is at (5,3). To get there from the player's position (4,-3), the player would need to move right 1 step, up 6 steps. But there's a wall at (1,3), which is 1 step right and 3 steps up. So path is blocked.

Alternatively, move the ""is"" rule by pushing it. Since the ""is"" rule is a movable object unless it's defined as stop. But in the current rules, the only stop is at (2,2). So the ""is"" rule can be moved.

So the plan: move right to reach the ""is"" rule at (5,3). But how?

Player's position is (4,-3). To get to (5,3):

Right 1, up 6. But walls are in the way. The wall at (1,3) is blocking the path up from (1,0) to (1,3). So maybe need to find another route.

Alternatively, move down to the ""is"" rule. The ""is"" is at (5,3). If the player moves down to (5,0), but there's a wall at (5,1) down. Not sure.

This is really confusing without a visual. Maybe the best action is to move right towards the ""is"" rule, hoping that the path clears or that the walls have shifted.

Let's try to figure out how to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. The current active rule is ""baba is you,"" meaning I can move Baba around. The goal is usually to reach the ""win"" object, which is typically a door or something similar. Let me check the objects on the map.

Looking at the objects, there's a door positioned at 4 steps to the left and 2 steps down. The ""win"" rule is at 5 steps to the right and 3 steps up. But right now, the door is a ""door"" object, and the ""win"" rule hasn't been redefined yet. So the default win condition is probably reaching the door, but I need to confirm that.

First, I need to see if there are any keys that I can pick up to unlock doors. There's a key at 2 steps to the left and 2 steps up. If I can get that key, maybe I can use it on the door. But how do I get there? The path might be blocked by walls or stop rules.

Looking at the map layout:

- The player (Baba) is probably at the starting position, which isn't explicitly listed, but based on the objects, maybe in the center or somewhere near. Let's assume I'm near the bottom left since the ""baba"" rule is at 5 steps to the left and 3 steps down, which might be where Baba's text block is located.

The active rules are ""baba is you,"" so I can move Baba. The walls are spread out, and there are several ""stop"" rules. The stop objects are immovable, so I can't push them. To move past them, I might need to rearrange the rules.

The key is at 2 left, 2 up. To get there, I need to move left twice and up twice. But there's a wall at 5 steps to the left and 2 steps up. Wait, no—if I'm starting near the bottom, maybe the key is in a different direction. Let me parse the positions again.

Current objects:

- Wall at 3 steps up.
- Rule 'is' at 4 right, 3 up.
- Rule 'win' at 5 right, 3 up.
- Rule 'wall' at 5 left, 2 up.
- Rule 'stop' at 3 left, 2 up.
- Key at 2 left, 2 up.
- Wall at 2 up.
- Wall at 1 up.
- Rule 'is' at 1 left, 1 down.
- Wall at 1 down.
- Rule 'key' at 4 right, 1 down.
- Door at 4 left, 2 down.
- Wall at 2 down.
- Rule 'baba' at 5 left, 3 down.
- Rule 'is' at 4 left, 3 down.
- Rule 'you' at 3 left, 3 down.
- Wall at 3 down.
- Rule 'door' at 3 right, 3 down.

So the key is to the left and up from my current position. Let me visualize the grid. Suppose I'm at position (0,0). Then:

- Key is at (-2, 2).
- Walls are at (-5, 2) [wall], (-3, 2) [stop], (3, 3) [wall], etc.
- The door is at (-4, -2).

To reach the key, I need to move left twice and up twice. But moving left from my current position (assuming I'm at, say, (0,0)) would take me to (-1,0), (-2,0), etc. But there's a wall at (-5,2), but that's up and to the left. The stop rule is at (-3,2), which is also up and left. The key is at (-2,2). So moving up from (0,0) to (0,1), then left to (-1,1), then left to (-2,1), then up to (-2,2) to get the key. But are there walls blocking this path?

Looking at the walls:

- At 3 steps up (y=3), there's a wall.
- At 2 steps up (y=2), there's a wall at 5 left (x=-5) and 3 left (x=-3). But the key is at x=-2, y=2, which is between x=-3 (stop) and x=-5 (wall). Wait, the stop is at x=-3, y=2. So moving left from x=0 to x=-2, y=2 would pass x=-1, y=2 (no wall), then x=-2, y=2 where the key is. But the stop is at x=-3, y=2. So moving left from x=0 to x=-2 is possible because there's no wall in between except at x=-5 and x=-3. So maybe I can get to the key by moving left twice and up twice.

But first, I need to check if I can move past any stop objects. The 'stop' rule is at x=-3, y=2. Since 'stop' makes that object immovable, I can't push or move it. So if I'm moving towards the key, which is at x=-2, y=2, I can go around the stop at x=-3, y=2 by moving up first then left. For example:

1. Move up to (0,1).
2. Move left to (-1,1).
3. Move left to (-2,1).
4. Move up to (-2,2) to get the key.

Once I have the key, I can use it on the door at (-4, -2). But how do I get there? The door is four steps left and two steps down from my current position (assuming starting at (0,0)). But there are walls and other rules in the way.

Alternatively, maybe I don't need the key. The 'win' rule is at (5,3), which is five steps right and three steps up. If I can reach that rule, I can change the win condition. But to get there, I have to move through walls and stops.

Alternatively, maybe I can redefine the 'win' rule. For example, if I can move the 'win' text block somewhere else, or create a new rule like 'baba is win'. But to do that, I need to move the existing 'win' rule or create a new one.

Looking at the current active rules: only 'baba is you'. The other rules are on the map as objects that I can pick up and move. So, for example, the 'win' rule is at (5,3). If I can move that 'win' rule to be under 'baba is', then it would make 'baba is win', making me the win condition. But how?

Wait, the rules are formed by text blocks. So the existing 'win' rule is a text block that says 'win'. To create a new rule like 'baba is win', I need to have the 'baba' text block and the 'win' text block next to each other with an 'is' in between. But the 'baba' rule is at (5,3) down, which is (5,-3) if we consider the current position as (0,0). The 'is' rule is at (4,3) up, so (4,3). The 'win' rule is at (5,3) up. So if I can move the 'baba' rule to be adjacent to the 'win' rule with an 'is' in between, then I can create 'baba is win'.

But to do that, I need to move the 'baba' rule, 'is' rule, and 'win' rule around. However, some of these are blocked by walls or stops. Let's see:

The 'baba' rule is at (5, -3) [3 steps down]. The 'is' rule is at (4,3) [3 steps up]. The 'win' rule is at (5,3) [3 steps up]. So if I can move the 'baba' rule up to be near the 'is' and 'win' rules, I could form 'baba is win'.

But moving the 'baba' rule up might be blocked. Let's check the path from (5,-3) to (5,3). There's a wall at (3,3) up, but that's not in the same column. The 'stop' rule is at (-3,2), which is in a different area. So maybe moving 'baba' up is possible.

Alternatively, maybe I can gather the necessary text blocks. Let's see:

To make 'baba is win', I need 'baba', 'is', and 'win' adjacent. The 'is' is at (4,3), 'win' at (5,3). 'baba' is at (5,-3). So if I move the 'baba' rule up to (5,2), then place the 'is' next to it, and 'win' next to that. But there's a wall at (3,3) up, but that's not in the same column. The path from (5,-3) to (5,2) would require moving up three steps. Are there walls in that column?

Looking at the walls in column x=5: At y=3, there's a wall. So moving up from (5,-3) to (5,0), (5,1), (5,2), then (5,3) is blocked by the wall. So that path is blocked. Therefore, moving 'baba' up directly is not possible.

Alternative approach: Maybe use the 'is' rule that's at (4,3) and the 'win' at (5,3). If I can move the 'baba' rule to (3,3), then place 'is' and 'win' next to it. But 'baba' is currently at (5,-3). To get to (3,3), I have to move left and up, but there are walls and stops in the way.

Alternatively, look for other 'is' rules. There's another 'is' at (1 left, 1 down), which is (-1,-1). Maybe using that 'is' to create a new rule. For example, move 'baba' to be next to 'is' and 'win', but again, the positioning is tricky.

Another idea: The 'you' rule is at (3 left, 3 down) which is (-3,-3). If I can make 'baba is you' into 'baba is win', but that requires changing the 'you' to 'win'. But 'you' is a separate text block. To do that, I need to move the 'you' block and replace it with 'win', but that might not be straightforward.

Alternatively, since I'm already 'baba is you', maybe I can push other objects. Wait, no—objects with 'stop' can't be moved. But since I'm Baba (you), can I push other objects that don't have 'stop' or 'push' rules? The default is that you can move adjacent objects unless they are 'stop' or have other restrictions.

Wait, the rules are a bit different. In Baba Is You, if an object is defined as 'push', you can push it. Otherwise, you can move past it unless it's 'stop'. So to move past a wall, you need to redefine the 'wall' rule or find a way around it.

Back to the key. If I can get the key at (-2,2), then use it on the door at (-4,-2). The door is a 'door' object, and typically, you need a key to open it. But the 'door' rule is at (3 right, 3 down), which is (3,-3). Wait, the door object is at (4 left, 2 down), which is (-4,-2). The 'door' rule is a separate text block at (3,-3). So to make the door passable, I might need to redefine the door's property. For example, making 'door is push' or 'door is you', but that's complicated.

Alternatively, if I have the key, I can move the key to the door's position and maybe that opens it. But in Baba Is You, you place the key on the door by adjacency, which would consume the key and open the door. So if I can move the key to the door's location, then the door becomes passable.

So steps could be:

1. Get the key at (-2,2).
2. Move to the door at (-4,-2).
3. Use the key by moving it next to the door.

But to do that, I need to navigate from the key to the door without getting blocked.

From the key at (-2,2), the path down to the door at (-4,-2) would require moving left twice and down four steps. There are walls along the way. Let's see:

Moving left from (-2,2) to (-3,2): there's a 'stop' rule at (-3,2), so can't move there. So need to go around. Maybe move down to (-2,1), then left to (-3,1), but there's a wall at (3,3) up, but that's not in this path. Wait, looking at the walls:

- At y=2, x=-5 is a wall, x=-3 is a stop.
- At y=1, x=3 is a wall (rule 'is' at (4,1) down?), no—the 'is' rule is at (2 steps right, 1 step down), which is (2,-1). So maybe at x=2, y=-1 there's an 'is' rule. But in the path from (-2,2) to (-4,-2), moving down to y=1 at x=-2, then left to x=-3, y=1. But is there a wall there? The wall at x=3, y=2 is up and right, so not in this path. The wall at x=2, y=2 is part of the upper structure. So maybe moving left from (-2,1) to (-3,1) is possible. Then down to (-3,0), (-3,-1), etc., but need to check for walls.

This seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way by redefining the rules.

Another approach: Since I'm Baba and can move, maybe I can move the 'win' rule to be under 'baba is', making 'baba is win'. The 'win' rule is at (5,3) up. The 'baba' rule is at (5,-3) down. The 'is' rule is at (4,3) up. So if I can move the 'baba' rule up to be adjacent to the 'is' and 'win' rules.

But moving 'baba' from (5,-3) to (5,3) is blocked by a wall at (3,3) up, but that's in a different column. Wait, moving up in the same column x=5: from (5,-3) up to (5,-2), (5,-1), (5,0), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3). Are there any walls in this column?

At y=3, x=5: there's a wall. So (5,3) is blocked. But maybe there's another path. For example, move 'baba' to x=4, y=3. Then place 'is' and 'win' next to it. But how?

Alternatively, use the existing 'is' rule at (4,3) and 'win' at (5,3). If I can move the 'baba' rule to (3,3), then place 'is' at (4,3) and 'win' at (5,3), making 'baba is win'. But to get 'baba' to (3,3), need to move left from (5,-3) up and left. Let's see:

Path from (5,-3) to (3,3):

- Move up to (5,0), (5,1), (5,2).
- Then left to (4,2), (3,2).
- Then up to (3,3).

But are there walls along this path?

At (5,3) there's a wall, but we're moving to (3,3). Along the way:

- At (5,2): is there a wall? The objects at y=2 are key at (-2,2), wall at (-5,2), stop at (-3,2), and wall at (2,2). So at x=5, y=2: no wall mentioned. The wall at x=3, y=2 is a stop, not a wall. So moving to (5,2) is possible.

Then left to (4,2): no wall mentioned. Left to (3,2): there's a 'stop' rule at (-3,2), but that's far left. At x=3, y=2: no wall. Then up to (3,3): which has a wall. So can't move there.

Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe another way. What if I move the 'is' rule to be between 'baba' and 'win'?

The 'is' rule is at (4,3). If I can move it to (4,-3), then have 'baba' at (5,-3) and 'win' at (5,3), but that doesn't help. Alternatively, move 'is' to (3,3), but there's a wall there.

Alternatively, look for other 'is' rules. There's another 'is' at (-1,-1). Maybe use that one. Move 'baba' to (-1,-1), then 'is' and 'win' next to it. For example:

- Move 'baba' from (5,-3) to (-1,-1).
- Then move 'is' from (-1,-1) to (-1,0) or something.
- Then move 'win' to (-1,1).

But this requires navigating around many walls and stops.

This is getting complicated. Maybe focusing on getting the key and using it on the door is better. Let's try that path again.

Getting the key at (-2,2):

1. From starting position (assumed to be near the bottom, maybe (0,0)), move up to (0,1), left to (-1,1), left to (-2,1), up to (-2,2) to get the key.

Then, from (-2,2), need to move to the door at (-4,-2).

Path options:

- Move left to (-3,2), but there's a 'stop' at (-3,2), so can","

Let's see. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" so I am Baba. The goal is usually to reach the ""win"" object, which is a door here, but the rules might change that.

Looking at the objects, there's a key at 2 steps to the left and 2 steps up. Maybe I need to get the key first? But how? The walls are blocking paths. Let's check the positions again.

The walls are arranged in a way that's creating barriers. The ""stop"" rule makes some objects immovable. Maybe I can move text blocks to change the rules. The ""is"" rules are movable if they're not stopped. 

There's a rule `is` at 1 step to the left and 1 step down. If I can move that, maybe I can create a new rule. For example, if I make ""baba is win,"" then touching the door would make me win. Or perhaps ""key is you"" so I can pick up the key. 

But how to move the `is` block? I need to navigate Baba to its position. The current position of Baba isn't specified here, but assuming I'm near the `is` block. Let's see, the `is` is at 1 step left and 1 step down. If I move left from my current position, I might reach it. 

Wait, the observation doesn't mention Baba's position. Maybe I need to figure that out based on the objects. The key is at 2 left, 2 up. The door is at 4 left, 2 down. The ""you"" rule is at 3 left, 3 down. 

Alternatively, maybe the key is needed to unlock something, but there's no lock mentioned. Alternatively, changing the ""you"" rule to something else. If I can make ""key is you,"" then picking up the key would make me the key, which might allow moving through stop walls. 

But to do that, I need to move the `is` block next to the key or the you rule. Let's think: The `is` block is at 1 left, 1 down. If I move left from there, perhaps I can attach it to the key. So the plan is: move to the `is` block, then move it to the key's position, create ""key is you,"" then go get the key and maybe the door becomes win. 

But first, I need to reach the `is` block. From the current position, maybe moving left and down. Wait, the observation says ""rule `is` 1 step to the left and 1 step down."" So if I'm positioned such that moving left once gets me to the `is` block. Then, after moving there, I can take the `is` block and move it to the key's location (2 left, 2 up). 

But the key is at 2 left, 2 up. The `is` block is at 1 left, 1 down. So to get from `is` to key: move up twice and right once. But moving up might be blocked by walls. Looking at the walls: there's a wall at 2 step up, and another at 1 step up. So perhaps the path is blocked. 

Alternatively, maybe the key is not necessary, and the solution is to change the ""win"" condition. The ""win"" rule is at 5 right, 3 up. If I can make ""baba is win,"" then touching the door (which is a win) would make me win. To do that, I need to move the `is` block next to ""baba"" and ""win."" 

The ""baba"" rule is at 5 left, 3 down. The ""is"" block is at 1 left, 1 down. So moving the `is` block to the ""baba"" and ""win"" position. Let's see: ""rule `baba` 5 step to the left and 3 steps down"" and ""rule `win` 5 steps to the right and 3 step up."" So to create ""baba is win,"" I need to place `is` between them. 

But the `is` block is currently at 1 left, 1 down. To get to the position between baba and win, I need to move it right and up. But there are walls in the way. The walls at 3 step up, 2 step up, etc., might block the path. 

Alternatively, maybe I can use the existing `is` blocks to create new rules. For example, if I move the `is` at 4 right, 3 up (from the initial observations) to combine with ""baba"" and ""win."" But the current observation shows the `is` at 4 right, 3 up as part of the active rules? Wait, no, active rules are only ""baba is you."" The other `is` blocks are objects on the map that can be moved. 

This is getting a bit confusing. Let me recap. The goal is to reach the door (win), but to do that, maybe I need to change the rules. Since I'm Baba, if I can make ""baba is win,"" then touching the door would win. To do that, I need to move the `is` block next to ""baba"" and ""win."" 

Looking at the current setup: ""rule `baba` 5 step to the left and 3 steps down"" and ""rule `win` 5 steps to the right and 3 step up."" The `is` block is at 4 right and 3 up. So if I can move that `is` block to the position between ""baba"" and ""win,"" forming ""baba is win,"" then that would work. 

But how to get there? The `is` block is at 4 right, 3 up. To move it left to align with ""baba"" which is 5 left, 3 down. That seems like a big move. Maybe there's a shorter path. Alternatively, use other `is` blocks. 

Another approach: Since I'm Baba and ""baba is you,"" if I can make the door a ""you"" or ""win,"" then touching it would work. For example, moving an `is` to make ""door is you,"" so I can push it, but doors are usually stops. Or ""door is win,"" so touching it wins. 

The ""door"" rule is at 3 steps to the right and 3 steps down. There's an `is` block at 4 steps to the right and 3 steps down. So if I move that `is` block to the door's position, creating ""door is win,"" then touching the door would make me win. 

So the plan is: move the `is` block at 4 right, 3 down next to the door (3 right, 3 down). To do that, need to move left from 4 right to 3 right. But the path might be blocked by walls. The wall at 3 steps down is there, but maybe I can navigate around. 

Alternatively, use the `is` block at 1 left, 1 down. If I move that block to the door's position, but that's 3 right, 3 down from there. Seems too far. 

Maybe the key is involved. If I can get the key, which is at 2 left, 2 up, and then use it to unlock something. But there's no lock mentioned. Alternatively, if ""key is you,"" then picking it up would make me the key, allowing me to move through stops. 

To make ""key is you,"" I need to move the `is` block next to ""key"" and ""you."" The ""you"" rule is at 3 left, 3 down. The key is at 2 left, 2 up. The `is` block is at 4 right, 1 down. Hmm, not sure. 

This is tricky. Let's think step by step. 

1. Current active rule: baba is you.
2. Need to reach the door (win) which is a door object. But the rule for win is a separate block at 5 right, 3 up.
3. Possible solutions:
   a. Make baba is win, so touching the door wins.
   b. Make door is win, so it's already a win but how?
   c. Make key is you, pick up the key, then use it to interact with something.
4. To create new rules, need to move `is` blocks next to subject and property.

Looking at the `is` blocks available:
- One is at 4 steps to the right and 3 step up (near the win rule).
- Another is at 1 step left and 1 step down.

If I move the `is` at 4 right, 3 up next to ""baba"" (5 left, 3 down) and ""win"" (5 right, 3 up), that's a long way. Alternatively, move it to the door and win.

Alternatively, use the `is` at 1 left, 1 down. If I can move it to the door's position (3 right, 3 down), but that's a big move.

Wait, maybe there's a shorter path. Let's see the coordinates:

Current `is` blocks:
- One at 4 right, 3 up.
- Another at 1 left, 1 down.

The door is at 3 right, 3 down. So the `is` at 4 right, 3 up is to the right and up from the door. To get there, move left and down. But there are walls at 3 step up and others.

Alternatively, maybe push objects. Since some objects are stop, can't push them. But maybe move the `is` block over them.

This is getting complicated. Maybe the simplest way is to move towards the `is` block at 1 left, 1 down, pick it up, and move it to the door's position to create ""door is win.""

So the steps would be:
1. Move left from current position to reach the `is` block at 1 left, 1 down.
2. Take the `is` block.
3. Move right and down to the door's position (3 right, 3 down).
4. Place the `is` block next to ""door"" and ""win"" to make ""door is win.""

But how to navigate there without hitting walls. The walls are at 3 step up, 2 step up, etc. Maybe the path is possible by moving around.

Alternatively, if the `is` block at 4 right, 3 up can be moved to the door. But that's further away.

Another angle: The ""you"" rule is at 3 left, 3 down. If I can make ""baba is you"" (already active), but maybe make ""you"" something else. For example, ""you is win,"" so touching the win object works. But the win object is the door.

Alternatively, make ""baba is door,"" then since I'm Baba, I would be the door, so touching it would win. To do that, need to create ""baba is door"" rule.

The ""baba"" rule is at 5 left, 3 down, and ""door"" rule is at 3 right, 3 down. The `is` block is at 4 right, 3 down. So moving the `is` block from 4 right, 3 down to between ""baba"" (5 left, 3 down) and ""door"" (3 right, 3 down) isn't possible because they are in opposite directions.

This is really challenging. Maybe I need to focus on moving the closest `is` block. Let's say the `is` at 1 left, 1 down. If I can move right and up to reach the key or other objects.

Alternatively, maybe the key is a distraction. The main goal is the door. Let's try to focus on changing the ""win"" condition to the door.

The ""win"" rule is at 5 right, 3 up. The `is` block is at 4 right, 3 up. So if I move the `is` block one step left to be next to ""win,"" then create ""something is win."" But what subject to choose?

If I make ""baba is win,"" then since I'm Baba, touching the door (which is win) would make me win. To do that, need to place `is` between ""baba"" and ""win.""

But ""baba"" is at 5 left, 3 down, and ""win"" is at 5 right, 3 up. The `is` is at 4 right, 3 up. To move it left to align with ""baba,"" which is far away. Not feasible.

Alternatively, use the `is` block at 1 left, 1 down. Move it all the way to the ""win"" position. That's 6 steps right and 2 steps up. Seems impossible due to walls.

Perhaps the solution is to create a rule that makes the door a win without touching it. For example, ""win is door,"" but that's the same as ""door is win.""

Alternatively, make ""push is you,"" allowing me to push objects. But there's no push rule yet.

Wait, the active rule is only ""baba is you."" Other rules like ""push"" or ""_win"" are objects on the map that can be moved.

This is really tricky. Maybe the intended solution is to move the `is` block next to ""baba"" and ""you"" to make ""baba is you"" (which is already the case), but that doesn't help. Alternatively, make ""you is win,"" so touching the win object works.

The ""you"" rule is at 3 left, 3 down. The ""win"" rule is at 5 right, 3 up. The `is` block is at 4 right, 3 up. So if I move the `is` block from 4 right, 3 up to between ""you"" (3 left, 3 down) and ""win"" (5 right, 3 up), but that's a diagonal move which isn't possible. 

Alternatively, move the `is` block at 4 right, 3 up down to 4 right, 2 up, then left to 3 right, 2 up, etc., navigating around walls to reach the ""you"" and ""win"" positions. But this seems complicated.

Another thought: The key is at 2 left, 2 up. If I can pick up the key by making ""key is you,"" then maybe I can use it to unlock something. But how? The key isn't near any locks.

Alternatively, if I become the key by making ""baba is key,"" then I can move the key to the door. But the door is a stop, so I can't push it. 

This is getting too convoluted. Maybe the simplest solution is to move the `is` block next to the door and the win rule to create ""door is win.""

The door is at 3 right, 3 down. The win rule is at 5 right, 3 up. The `is` block is at 4 right, 3 up. So moving the `is` block left to 3 right, 3 up (aligning with door's x-coordinate, 3 right, but y is different). Not sure.

Alternatively, move the `is` block from 4 right, 3 up down to 4 right, 3 down, then left to 3 right, 3 down (door's position). But there's a wall at 3 steps down. So can't move through walls.

Hmm. Maybe I need to go around the walls. For example, move the `is` block from 4 right, 3 up down to 4 right, 2 up (passing through walls?), but if those are stop properties, I can't move through them.

This is really challenging. Maybe I should try moving towards the `is` block at 1 left, 1 down, pick it up, and move it towards the door. Let's see:

1. Move left from current position to reach the `is` block at 1 left, 1 down.
2. Take the `is` block.
3. Move right (to 0 left, 1 down), then right again to 1 right, 1 down.
4. Move down to 1 right, 2 down.
5. Move down again to 1 right, 3 down (door's position).
6. Place the `is` block next to the door, creating ""door is win.""

 But the door's rule is at 3 right, 3 down. So placing `is` between door and win might not work. Alternatively, create ""door is win"" by having `is` next to door and win. But win is at 5 right, 3 up, so not adjacent.

This isn't working. Maybe I need to find another approach.

Wait, the ""rule `you` 3 steps down"" is present. If I can make ""you is win,"" then touching the win object (door) would work. To do that, move the `is` block next to ""you"" and ""win.""

The ""you"" rule is at 3 left, 3 down. The ""win"" rule is at 5 right, 3 up. The `is` block is at 4 right, 3 up. So moving the `is` block left to 3 left, 3 down (next to ""you"") and up to align with ""win."" Not possible.

Alternatively, move the `is` block from 4 right, 3 up left to 3 right, 3 up, then down to 3 right, 3 down (you're position). But there's a wall at 3 steps down. 

This is really stuck. Maybe the solution is to move the `is` block to create ""baba is door,"" making me the door, so touching it wins. 

The ""baba"" rule is at 5 left, 3 down. The ""door"" rule is at 3 right, 3 down. The `is` block is at 4 right, 3 down. So moving the `is` block from 4 right, 3 down left to 3 right, 3 down (door's position), then placing it between ""baba"" and ""door."" But ""baba"" is 2 left from the door. So can't place `is` between them.

Alternatively, move the `is` block to the ""baba"" and ""door"" positions. But they're too far apart.

Maybe I need to accept that I'm stuck and try a different approach. Let's look for the nearest movable `is` block. The one at 1 left, 1 down is closer. Let's try to move there.

Assuming my current position is somewhere, but the observation doesn't specify where I am. This makes it harder. Without knowing my position, it's hard to navigate.

Alternatively, focus on the fact","

Let's try to figure out how to solve this Baba Is You level. The active rule right now is ""baba is you,"" which means I can move and interact with other text blocks. The goal is usually to reach the ""win"" object, but sometimes you have to change the rules to do that.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a door to the left at 4 steps left and 2 steps down. The ""win"" rule is at 5 steps right and 3 steps up. But I can't just walk there because there are walls blocking the path. The walls are positioned in such a way that they might be stopping me from moving straight towards the win rule or the door.

There's a key at 2 steps left and 2 steps up. Maybe I need to get the key to unlock something, but I don't see a lock yet. Alternatively, the key could be a red herring. The ""stop"" rule is at 3 steps left and 2 steps up, which means anything touching that is immovable. So I have to be careful not to step into that area.

The rule blocks are scattered around. The ""is"" rule is at 4 steps right and 3 steps up. Since ""is"" is a necessary component to create or modify rules, maybe I need to move that somewhere. For example, if I can combine ""is"" with ""baba"" and ""you"" or ""win,"" I could change the rules. But right now, the ""you"" rule is at 3 steps left and 3 steps down. If I can make Baba ""you,"" then I could control him directly.

Wait, the current active rule is ""baba is you,"" so I am already Baba. That means I can push movable objects (like text blocks) that aren't stopped. The ""stop"" rule is at 3 steps left and 2 steps up, so I need to avoid that area. Let me check the positions again:

- Wall 3 steps up: that's above me maybe?
- Rule `is` at 4 right, 3 up: perhaps above to the right.
- Rule `win` at 5 right, 3 up: even further right.
- Rule `wall` at 5 left, 2 up: left side, up a bit.
- Rule `stop` at 3 left, 2 up: left side, same level as the wall there.
- Key at 2 left, 2 up: left side, same level as the stop rule.
- Walls continuing down.

The door is at 4 left, 2 down: so to the left and down a couple steps. The ""baba"" rule is at 5 left, 3 down: further left and down. The ""you"" rule is at 3 left, 3 down. The ""door"" rule is at 3 right, 3 down.

My current position isn't specified, but based on the objects, maybe I'm somewhere in the middle. Let's assume I'm near the bottom because there's a rule `baba` and `you` down there. The goal is to reach the `win` rule, which is up and to the right. But there's a wall at 3 steps up. Maybe I can move the `is` rule to combine with other rules.

If I can move the `is` block at 4 right, 3 up, perhaps to create a new rule like ""door is win"" or something. But first, I need to navigate to that `is` block. The path might be blocked by walls. Alternatively, move the `you` rule near `baba` to make ""baba is you"" (which is already active), but that might not help.

Wait, the ""you"" rule is at 3 left, 3 down. If I can move that towards a ""baba"" block, then perhaps create a new rule. But the `baba` rule is at 5 left, 3 down. So maybe I can push the `you` rule to the right to be next to `baba`, then combine them with the `is` rule. That would make ""baba is you,"" which is already the case. Hmm, not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe make ""door is win"" so that stepping on door makes you win. The `win` rule is separate, so if I can move `is` next to `door` and `win`, then it becomes ""door is win."" Then, if I can reach the door, it would trigger the win condition. The door is at 4 left, 2 down. There's a wall at 2 steps up, but maybe I can go around.

But to do that, I need to move the `is` block. Let's see where I am. If the `is` block is at 4 right, 3 up, and I'm somewhere in the middle, maybe I need to go right and up. But there's a wall at 2 steps up. Wait, the wall at 2 step up is a horizontal wall? Or is it vertical? The description says ""wall 2 step up,"" which might mean two steps upward from my current position. Similarly, ""wall 1 step up"" is one step up.

Assuming I'm at position (0,0), then:

- Wall at (0,3)
- Rule `is` at (4,3)
- Rule `win` at (5,3)
- Rule `wall` at (-5,2)
- Rule `stop` at (-3,2)
- Key at (-2,2)
- Wall at (0,2)
- Wall at (0,1)
- Rule `is` at (-1,1)
- Wall at (0,1)
- Rule `key` at (4,1)
- Door at (-4,2)
- Wall at (0,2)
- Rule `baba` at (-5,3)
- Rule `is` at (-4,3)
- Rule `you` at (-3,3)
- Wall at (0,3)
- Rule `door` at (3,3)

This is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should try to reach the `is` block at (4,3) to create a new rule. To get there, I need to move right and up, but there's a wall at (0,3) (my position's up). Wait, maybe my position is different. Alternatively, perhaps the walls are arranged in such a way that they block direct paths.

Another approach: Since I'm Baba and ""baba is you,"" I can move any object that isn't stopped. The `stop` rule is at (-3,2), so I have to avoid that area. The key is at (-2,2), but I don't know if I need it. Maybe the door is the way to go, but it's behind a wall. Wait, the door is at (-4,2), which is to the left. There's a wall at (-5,2) and stop at (-3,2). So to get to the door, I have to go left past the stop rule? But the stop rule makes anything there immovable, so I can't push through.

Alternatively, maybe rearrange the rules to make ""stop is nothing"" or remove the stop property. But how? To do that, I need to move the `stop` rule or change its property. For example, if I can make ""stop is push"" or something, but that would require moving the `stop` rule text block.

But the `stop` rule is at (-3,2). To move it, I need to be adjacent to it and push it. Since I'm Baba (you), I can push it if it's not stopped. But the `stop` rule itself is a stop, so can I push it? Wait, the rules say you can only move objects that are not defined as ""STOP"" or similar. The `stop` rule is a text block, so if the rule is ""stop is stop,"" then pushing it would be impossible. But the current active rule is ""baba is you,"" and there's no other rule defining what can be moved. So maybe I can push the `stop` rule.

Wait, the `stop` rule is a text block that says ""stop is [property]"". The current active rules only have ""baba is you"". So the `stop` rule's property isn't defined yet. Wait, no—the `stop` rule is a text block, so it's part of the level's initial setup. The active rules are the ones that are currently in effect. The initial active rule is ""baba is you"". The other rules like ""wall is [property]"" are part of the level's setup but may not be active unless moved and combined with ""is"".

So the `stop` rule at (-3,2) is a text block saying ""stop is ..."", but since no other rule defines what stop is, it's just a static text block. Therefore, I can push it because it's not defined as ""STOP"" in an active rule. So maybe I can move the `stop` rule out of the way.

If I can move the `stop` rule, then perhaps I can path through to the door. Let's see: the door is at (-4,2), which is left of the `stop` rule at (-3,2). So if I push the `stop` rule one step left to (-4,2), then the door would be at (-4,2), which is now where the `stop` rule was. But the door is a separate object; maybe that's not helpful. Alternatively, moving the `stop` rule away so I can go left past it.

But how to reach the `stop` rule at (-3,2)? From my current position, which I'm not sure about, but assuming I'm near the bottom where the `baba` rule is at (-5,3), `is` at (-4,3), `you` at (-3,3), etc. Maybe I'm at (-3,3), which is where the `you` rule is. If I move down to (-3,2), that's the `stop` rule's position. But can I move there? There's a wall at (0,2) which might be blocking, but if I'm on the left side, maybe I can move left.

Alternatively, maybe I need to get the `is` rule at (4,3) and combine it with `door` and `win` to make ""door is win"". To do that, I need to move the `is` block to be next to `door` and `win`. The `win` rule is at (5,3), and `door` is at (-4,2). That's a long way. Maybe there's a shorter path.

Alternatively, create ""key is win"" so that picking up the key makes me win. The key is at (-2,2). If I can move the `is` block to (-2,2) and make ""key is win"", then picking up the key would trigger the win rule. But how to pick up the key? In Baba Is You, you can push objects but not necessarily ""pick up"" them in the traditional sense. You have to move them adjacent to the target.

So if I move the `key` to be next to the `win` rule, and have an `is` block between them, then it becomes ""key is win"". Then, stepping on the key would make it a win. But I need to be adjacent to the key to move it. The key is at (-2,2). To get there, I need to navigate from wherever I am, avoiding walls and the stop rule.

This is getting complicated. Let me try to outline steps:

1. Identify all movable objects: `is`, `win`, `wall` (if not stopped), `key`, `door`, `baba`, `you`. Since `baba` is me, and I'm defined as `you`, I can move.

2. The goal is to reach `win`, but it's blocked by walls. Alternatively, change the rules so that something else is win.

3. The `is` block is crucial for creating new rules. Need to move it to combine with other objects.

4. Possible new rules:
   - `door is win`: stepping on door wins.
   - `key is win`: picking up key wins.
   - `baba is win`: making myself win.

5. To create `door is win`, need `is` next to `door` and `win`. `door` is at (-4,2), `win` at (5,3). Too far apart.

6. To create `key is win`, need `is` next to `key` (-2,2) and `win` (5,3). Also far.

7. To create `baba is win`, need `is` next to `baba` (-5,3) and `win` (5,3). Possible if I can move `is` to (-5,3) and `win` to (-5,3), but `win` is at (5,3).

Alternatively, move `win` to be next to `baba`. But `win` is a text block; I can push it if it's not stopped. There's no rule making `win` immovable, so I can move it. Let's see:

- Current `win` at (5,3). If I can push it left, maybe to (-5,3) where `baba` is. But the path is blocked by walls and other objects. For example, there's a wall at (0,3), so moving left from (5,3) would require going through (4,3), (3,3), etc., but there's a `rule door` at (3,3), which is a text block. Can I push past that? Since `door` isn't defined as stop, I can push it. So maybe I can move `win` left by pushing it through the other text blocks.

But this seems complicated. Maybe a better approach is to focus on the `is` block. If I can move the `is` at (4,3) down to where `you` is at (-3,3), then combine it with `baba` and `you` to reinforce the rule, but that's already active.

Alternatively, move `is` to the area of the door. For example, move `is` from (4,3) to (3,3), then to (2,3), etc., down to (2,2) or (1,2), but there are walls and other objects in the way.

Another idea: The `key` is at (-2,2). If I can move the `key` to be next to the `win` rule, and have an `is` block between them, making ""key is win"". Then, if I can pick up the key (by moving it next to me), then stepping on it would trigger the win rule. But how to move the key.

To move the key at (-2,2), I need to be adjacent to it. Suppose I'm at (-3,3) where the `you` rule is. If I move down to (-3,2), which is the `stop` rule's position. But can I move there? The `stop` rule is a text block; since there's no active rule saying ""stop is stop"", maybe I can push it. Wait, the `stop` rule is a text block that says ""stop is ..."", but without an active rule defining its property, it's just a movable object. So if I can push the `stop` rule out of the way, then I can move left to (-4,2) which is the door's position.

So steps:

1. Push the `stop` rule at (-3,2) one step left to (-4,2), which is where the door is. But the door is an object; can I replace the `stop` rule there? Maybe, but the door is a separate object. Alternatively, moving the `stop` rule away allows me to move left past it.

2. Once the `stop` rule is moved, I can go left to (-4,2), which is the door. But the door is a rule `door` at (3,3) in previous observations, but in the current map, the `door` rule is at (3 steps to the right and 3 steps down), which might be (3,3) if I'm at (0,0). Wait, this is getting too confusing without knowing the exact grid.

Alternatively, focus on moving the `is` block to create a new rule. For example, move `is` to be next to `door` and `win`, making ""door is win"". But the distance is too great.

Alternatively, create ""baba is win"" by moving `is` next to `baba` and `win`. `baba` is at (-5,3), `win` at (5,3). To move `is` from (4,3) to (-5,3), that's a long way. Would require pushing past many objects, including walls and other rules.

This is really tricky. Maybe the intended solution is to move the `is` rule to combine with `door` and `win`, but I'm not seeing the path. Alternatively, use the key to unlock something, but there's no lock visible.

Wait, another thought: The `key` is at (-2,2). If I can move the `key` to be next to the `win` rule, and have an `is` block between them, making ""key is win"". Then, if I can push the key to the `win` position, and have the `is` there, then stepping on the key would make it a win. But how to do that.

Let me try to outline the steps:

1. Move the `is` block from (4,3) to (-2,2) where the key is. This would require moving left through several steps, avoiding walls.

- From (4,3) move left to (3,3), but there's a `rule door` at (3,3). Can I push that? Since `door` isn't stopped, yes. So push `door` left to (2,3).

- Then move `is` left to (3,3), now vacated.

- Continue left to (2,3) where `door` is now, push it to (1,3), then move `is` to (2,3).

This is getting too involved. Maybe there's a simpler way.

Wait, the current active rule is ""baba is you"", so I am Baba. The `you` rule is at (-3,3). If I can move the `you` rule next to `baba`, but they're already adjacent. The `is` rule is at (4,3). If I can move `is` to (-5,3) where `baba` is, then combining `baba`, `is`, and `you` would just reinforce the existing rule.

Alternatively, move `is` to the `win` rule at (5,3). Then","

Let's try to figure out how to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. The active rule is still ""baba is you,"" which means I can move around freely since I'm Baba. Looking at the objects on the map:

There's a key located 2 steps to the left and 2 steps up. The door is 4 steps to the left and 2 steps down. There are also several walls and rules scattered around. The win condition is probably the door, but I need to get past it. However, the door might be stopped by a wall or another ""stop"" property.

First, I need to check if there's a way to make the door passable. The current rules don't have ""door is push"" or anything like that. The ""stop"" rule is at 3 steps to the left and 2 steps up. Maybe if I can remove the ""stop"" property from that wall or replace it with something else that allows me to move through the door.

Looking at the text blocks, there's a rule ""rule `is` 1 step to the left and 1 step down."" That might be a movable ""IS"" block. If I can move that ""IS"" block, maybe I can create a new rule that changes the door's property. For example, if I can make ""door is you"" or ""door is win,"" that could help. But I need to figure out how to place the text blocks correctly.

Alternatively, since I'm Baba and ""baba is you,"" maybe I can push other objects. But the problem is that some objects are defined as ""stop,"" which means they can't be moved. The ""stop"" block at 3 steps left and 2 steps up is probably preventing movement in that area. If I can change that ""stop"" to something else, like ""stop is nothing,"" then maybe I can move through it.

Wait, another idea: if I can create a rule like ""door is you,"" then stepping on the door would make me the win condition. But how to do that? I need to find a movable ""IS"" block and a ""door"" block. The ""door"" is at 4 steps left and 2 steps down. There's a ""rule `door` 3 steps to the right and 3 steps down"" in some previous observations, but in the current state, the ""door"" object is at 4 steps left and 2 steps down.

There's also a ""rule `is` 1 step to the left and 1 step down."" If I can move that ""IS"" block near the ""door"" and ""you"" rule, maybe I can form ""door is you."" The ""you"" rule is at 3 steps left and 3 steps down. So if I can move the ""IS"" block between ""door"" and ""you,"" then combining them would create ""door is you,"" making the door the win condition.

But how do I move the ""IS"" block? Since I'm Baba, and I can move any object that's not ""stop."" The ""rule `is`"" block at 1 step left and 1 step down—where is that located relative to me? The current observation doesn't specify my position, but assuming I'm starting somewhere, maybe I need to navigate to that ""IS"" block.

Alternatively, there's a ""rule `you`"" at 3 steps left and 3 steps down. If I can pair that with a ""door"" and an ""IS"" block, that might work. Let me think about the positions:

- ""door"" is at 4 steps left and 2 steps down.
- ""rule `you`"" is at 3 steps left and 3 steps down.
- ""rule `is`"" is at 1 step left and 1 step down.

So the ""IS"" block is to the right and above the ""you"" rule. If I can move the ""IS"" block down and to the left to align with the ""door"" and ""you,"" then I can create ""door is you."" To do that, I need to move the ""IS"" block. Since I'm Baba and not blocked by ""stop"" (unless the ""stop"" rule is active), I should be able to push the ""IS"" block.

But the movement actions are limited to up, down, left, right, or idle. So I need to navigate to the ""IS"" block's position, which is 1 step left and 1 step down from my current location. Once there, I can move it to the desired location near the ""door"" and ""you"" rules.

Alternatively, maybe there's a key involved. The key is at 2 steps left and 2 steps up. If I can pick up the key, does that do anything? In Baba Is You, keys are usually used to unlock doors, but since the door here might not be locked but just a regular door, maybe the key isn't necessary. However, if the door is behind a ""stop"" wall, the key might not help unless it's used to create a new rule.

Another approach: since ""baba is you,"" maybe I can push the ""stop"" block away. But the ""stop"" rule is at 3 steps left and 2 steps up, and it's part of a wall. If I can change the ""wall is stop"" to something else, like ""wall is nothing,"" then the wall wouldn't block me. But to do that, I need to manipulate the text blocks.

For example, the ""rule `wall` 5 step to the left and 2 step up"" might be creating the wall. If I can move that ""wall"" rule to a different position or replace it with another rule, like ""wall is push,"" then the wall might not be stopping me. But again, I need to find the ""IS"" block to create new rules.

Wait, in the current observation, there's a ""rule `is` 4 steps to the right and 3 step up."" That's one of the ""IS"" blocks I can potentially move. If I can move that ""IS"" block next to the ""wall"" rule, I could change the wall's property. For example, moving ""IS"" to make ""wall is push"" or ""wall is you,"" but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the ""rule `is` 1 step to the left and 1 step down"" is probably the key here. If I can move that ""IS"" block to connect with the ""door"" and ""you"" rules, creating ""door is you,"" then stepping on the door would make me win. To do that, I need to navigate to the ""IS"" block, pick it up (by moving adjacent to it), and then move it to the position between ""door"" and ""you.""

But how do I move the ""IS"" block? Since I'm Baba, and assuming I'm not blocked, I can push the ""IS"" block by moving into it from the side. For example, if the ""IS"" block is at 1 step left and 1 step down, and I'm to the right of it, I could move left to push it further left. But I need to know my current position relative to these objects.

Assuming my position is somewhere in the middle, perhaps I need to move right to reach the ""IS"" block at 4 steps to the right and 3 step up. Wait, in the current observation, the ""rule `is`"" blocks are at various positions. The main one I see is ""rule `is` 4 steps to the right and 3 step up"" and ""rule `is` 1 step to the left and 1 step down.""

Maybe the best approach is to move towards the ""IS"" block at 1 step left and 1 step down, pick it up, and then move it to the area where the ""door"" and ""you"" rules are. Let's break it down step by step:

1. Determine my current position. Since the observation doesn't specify it, I'll have to infer based on the objects. For example, if the ""wall 3 step up"" is directly above me, then I might be below that wall.

2. Navigate to the ""rule `is` 1 step to the left and 1 step down."" To get there, I might need to move left and down.

3. Once adjacent to the ""IS"" block, move in the direction I want to push it. For example, if I move left, the ""IS"" block would move left as well.

4. After moving the ""IS"" block near the ""door"" (4 steps left, 2 steps down) and the ""you"" rule (3 steps left, 3 steps down), combine them into ""door is you.""

5. Then, move to the door and step on it, which would trigger the win condition since ""door is you"" and ""baba is you"" makes me the door.

Alternatively, if I can create ""you is door,"" that could also work. It depends on the syntax required for the rules.

Another possibility is to make the door a win condition. There's a ""rule `win` 5 steps to the right and 3 step up."" If I can move that ""win"" rule to the door's location, then the door would be the win object. But moving the ""win"" rule would require picking it up and placing it elsewhere.

However, the ""win"" rule is at 5 steps to the right and 3 step up, which is quite far from the door. That might be difficult without knowing the exact layout.

Given the time I've spent and the previous actions of moving left and right without success, perhaps the correct approach is to focus on manipulating the ""IS"" block to create the desired rule. Let's try moving the ""IS"" block at 1 step left and 1 step down towards the door and ""you"" rules.

To do that, I need to move in the direction opposite to where the ""IS"" block is. If the ""IS"" block is 1 step left and 1 step down from my current position, moving right and up would push it further away. Wait, no—if I'm next to the ""IS"" block and move in the direction I want it to go, I can push it. For example, if the ""IS"" block is to my left, and I move left, it would move left as well. But I need to position it between the ""door"" and ""you.""

Assuming the ""IS"" block is at (x-1, y-1) relative to me, I would move left to push it to (x-2, y-1), then continue moving left until it's adjacent to the ""door"" at (x-4, y-2). But this requires precise movement.

Alternatively, maybe the ""IS"" block is closer. Let's look at the current positions:

- ""rule `is`"" is at 1 step to the left and 1 step down. So if I'm at position (0,0), the ""IS"" block is at (-1, -1).

- The ""door"" is at 4 steps left and 2 steps down, which would be (-4, -2).

- The ""you"" rule is at 3 steps left and 3 steps down, which is (-3, -3).

To move the ""IS"" block from (-1, -1) to near the door at (-4, -2), I need to move it left and down. But how?

If I'm at (0,0), moving left to (-1,0), then down to (-1,-1) to get to the ""IS"" block. Once there, moving left again would push the ""IS"" block to (-2,-1), then left to (-3,-1), etc., until it's near the door. But this might take several moves.

Alternatively, maybe there's a shorter path. If I can move the ""IS"" block down first, but I need to be adjacent to it.

This is getting a bit complicated without knowing the exact starting position. Maybe the best action right now is to move left towards the ""IS"" block to pick it up and then move it towards the door and ""you"" rules. So the first action would be to move left.

Let me try to figure out what to do here. The active rule is still ""baba is you,"" which means I can move Baba and any objects that are defined by other rules, but only if they're not stopped by a ""STOP"" or similar property.

Looking at the objects on the map, the key is to the left and up a bit. There's a door towards the left as well. The ""win"" rule is on the far right, so I need a way to get there. But there are walls blocking the path.

The ""baba"" rule is at the left side, 4 steps to the left and 3 steps down. Maybe I can move that ""baba is"" text block to change the rules. If I can make ""baba"" into ""win"" or remove the ""wall"" rules, that might help. 

The ""is"" text blocks are scattered. If I can move one of them next to ""baba"" and change the property, perhaps turning ""baba"" into ""win,"" then touching the door (which is a ""door"" but maybe if ""baba"" is ""win,"" touching it would win). Alternatively, making the door a ""win"" by moving the ""win"" rule onto it.

Wait, the current ""win"" rule is all the way to the right. To get there, I need to move past walls. The walls are either stopped or not. Since I'm Baba and ""baba is you,"" I can push objects that aren't stopped. The ""stop"" rule is at 2 steps to the left and 2 steps up. So anything with ""stop"" can't be moved. 

The key is at 1 step to the left and 2 steps up. If I can get the key, maybe that opens a door, but I don't see a locked door here. Alternatively, using the key to move something else? Not sure. 

Looking at the rule `baba` at 4 steps left and 3 steps down. If I can move that ""baba"" text block next to an ""is"" rule, then I can change its property. For example, if I bring it next to the ""is"" at 3 steps left and 3 steps down, I could make ""baba"" something else. But how do I move the ""baba"" rule? Since I'm you (baba), I can push it if it's not stopped. The ""stop"" is at 3 steps left and 2 steps up, which isn't near the ""baba"" rule. So maybe I can move the ""baba"" rule left or right.

If I move the ""baba"" rule to be next to the ""is"" rule at 3 steps left and 3 steps down, then I can change it. For example, if I make ""baba is win,"" then touching the door (which is a win) would work. Alternatively, making the door a win by moving the ""win"" rule onto it.

Alternatively, the ""you"" rule is at 2 steps left and 3 steps down. If I can make ""you"" into something else, but since I'm already ""baba is you,"" maybe that's not necessary.

Another approach: The ""rule `is`"" at 1 step down. If I can move that ""is"" next to the ""win"" rule (5 steps right, 3 up), then maybe create a new rule like ""something is win."" But where is ""something"" here? The key is at 1 step left and 2 up. If I can make the key a win, then grab the key and place it near the door. But how?

Wait, the key is already there. If I can move the key to the door, but the door is at 3 steps left and 2 steps down. The path might be blocked by walls. The wall at 1 step right and 3 up is towards the right, but the door is to the left. Maybe moving left from the current position.

But in the latest observation, the active rules haven't changed much. The key is 1 step left and 2 up. If I move left twice, I can get to the key. Then, maybe use the key to unlock something? But I don't see a locked door. Alternatively, move the ""key"" rule to somewhere else. For example, move the ""key"" rule next to the ""door"" to make ""door is key,"" but that doesn't help.

Alternatively, the main goal is to reach the ""win"" rule on the right. To do that, I need to remove the walls. The walls are defined by ""wall is ..."" rules. If I can move the ""wall"" rules away or change their properties. For example, if I can make ""wall is stop"" into ""wall is nothing,"" then the walls wouldn't block. But how?

The ""rule `wall`"" is at 4 steps left and 2 up. If I can move that ""wall"" rule next to an ""is"" rule, I can change its property. For instance, moving it to the ""is"" at 5 steps right and 3 up, making ""wall is win"" or something. But the ""is"" rules are scattered. The ""is"" at 1 step down might be useful.

Alternatively, focus on changing ""baba"" into ""win."" If I can make ""baba is win,"" then touching any win object (like the door) would win. To do that, I need to move the ""baba"" rule next to an ""is"" rule and then replace its property with ""win.""

The ""baba"" rule is at 4 left, 3 down. There's an ""is"" rule at 3 left, 3 down. If I move the ""baba"" rule one step left to be next to the ""is"" rule, then I can change its property to ""win"" by moving the ""win"" rule there. The ""win"" rule is at 6 right, 3 up. That's far away. Maybe I can move the ""win"" rule down using other ""is"" rules.

Alternatively, use the ""is"" rule at 1 step down. If I can move the ""baba"" rule to be next to that ""is"" rule, then set ""baba"" to ""win."" But how to move the ""baba"" rule? Since I'm you (baba), I can push it if there's no stop. The ""stop"" is at 3 left, 2 up, which isn't near the ""baba"" rule. So maybe move left from the current position to reach the ""baba"" rule.

Wait, in the latest observation, the position of the agent (Baba) isn't explicitly stated. But looking at the objects, the ""rule `baba`"" is at 4 steps left and 3 steps down. So perhaps the agent is near there. If I can move left to get to that ""baba"" rule and then move it next to an ""is"" rule to change its property.

Alternatively, the key is at 1 left and 2 up. Maybe moving right to get to the key first, then use it to move other objects. But I don't see how the key helps here.

Another angle: The door is at 3 left and 2 down. If I can make the door a win, then touching it would work. To do that, move the ""win"" rule onto the door. The ""win"" rule is at 6 right, 3 up. That's a long way. Maybe use other ""is"" rules to move it step by step.

Alternatively, since ""baba is you,"" maybe push the ""is"" rules to rearrange them. For example, push the ""is"" at 7 right, 3 up (from earlier observations) to move the ""win"" rule closer. But in the current observation, the ""is"" rules are in different positions.

This is getting complicated. Let me recap:

Goals:
1. Reach the ""win"" rule on the right.
2. Alternatively, make Baba itself the win condition.

Possible actions:
- Move towards the ""win"" rule by pushing through walls if possible.
- Move text blocks to change rules. For example, move ""baba"" next to ""is"" and change its property to ""win.""

Given the current setup, the ""baba"" rule is at 4 left, 3 down. The nearest ""is"" rule is at 3 left, 3 down. If I can move the ""baba"" rule one step left to be adjacent to that ""is"" rule, then I can place the ""win"" rule there, making ""baba is win."" 

To do that, I need to push the ""baba"" rule left. Since I'm Baba, and there's no ""stop"" blocking, I can move left. So the action would be to move left repeatedly until I'm next to the ""is"" rule, then place the ""win"" rule there. 

But in the current observation, the exact positions matter. Let me check the coordinates again.

The ""baba"" rule is at 4 steps left and 3 steps down. The ""is"" rule is at 3 steps left and 3 steps down. So the distance between them is 1 step to the right. So if I'm currently at the ""baba"" rule's position, moving left once would place me next to the ""is"" rule. Then, I can take the ""win"" rule (5 steps right, 3 up) and move it down to be next to the ""is"" rule, creating ""baba is win.""

But how to move the ""win"" rule there? The ""win"" is 5 steps right and 3 up from the current position. That's quite far. Alternatively, use other ""is"" rules to move it step by step. Maybe move the ""win"" rule left using the ""is"" at 1 step down.

Alternatively, focus on moving the ""is"" rules to bridge the gap. This might take multiple steps, but given the problem's context, perhaps the immediate action is to move left towards the ""baba"" rule to position it correctly.

So the next action should be to move left to reach the ""baba"" rule and then adjust the rules.

Let's see. The current active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I can move around and push things, right? The goal is usually to reach a ""win"" object, but sometimes you have to change the rules. Looking at the objects on the map:

There's a key at 2 steps up. I might need that to open a door. Then there's a door at 2 steps to the left and 2 steps down. But the door is probably locked unless I have the key. Wait, but the key is at 2 steps up, which is above the door. Maybe I need to go get the key first.

Looking at the rules, there's a rule ""rule `is` 1 step to the right and 1 step down."" That's a text block that says ""IS,"" which I can probably move to rewrite other rules. Also, there's a ""rule `you` 1 step to the left and 3 steps down."" If I can move that ""you"" rule onto Baba, then Baba would become the ""you"" entity, meaning I can control him directly. But how?

Baba is at 3 steps to the left and 3 steps down, according to the object list. Wait, no, looking again: ""rule `baba` 3 step to the left and 3 steps down."" So the actual Baba object is there. To make Baba the ""you,"" I need to move the ""you"" rule onto him. The ""you"" rule is at 1 step to the left and 3 steps down. So maybe I need to move that ""you"" text block next to the Baba rule.

But first, can I move the ""you"" rule? The rules state that only objects not defined as ""STOP"" or similar can be moved. The current active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I can move Baba or any text blocks that aren't stopped. The ""stop"" rule is at 1 step to the left and 2 step up. So as long as I'm not stepping on a ""stop"" object, I can move.

Looking at the map, the path to the ""you"" rule at 1 step left and 3 steps down might be blocked by walls. Let me visualize the layout. To the left of Baba's position (3 steps left and 3 down), there's a wall at 3 steps left and 2 steps up. Wait, maybe the walls are arranged in a way that creates a barrier. The key is at 2 steps up, so maybe I need to go up first to get the key, then come down.

Alternatively, the door is at 2 steps left and 2 steps down. If I can open that door, maybe it leads to the win condition. But without the key, the door is probably a stop or can't be opened. So getting the key first makes sense.

To get the key at 2 steps up, I need to move up from my current position. But looking at the objects, there's a wall at 2 steps to the right and 3 step up. Wait, no, the active rules are ""baba is you,"" so I can move over walls unless they're marked as stop. The ""stop"" rule is at 1 step to the left and 2 step up. So if I move towards the key, which is 2 steps up, I have to check if there are any stops in the way.

The key is at 2 step up. My current position isn't specified, but based on the objects, maybe I'm near the left side. To move up to the key, I need to go up twice. But between me and the key, is there a wall? The walls are at various positions, but the key is at 2 step up, and there's a wall at 2 steps to the right and 2 step up. So if I'm to the left of that wall, moving up might be possible.

Alternatively, maybe the key is at 2 step up directly, and I can move up twice to reach it. Once I have the key, I can move to the door at 2 steps left and 2 steps down. But the door is a rule door at 5 steps to the right and 3 steps down. Wait, the door's position is a bit confusing. Let me check again:

The door is at ""2 step to the left and 2 steps down."" So from my current position, moving left twice and down twice would reach the door. But I need the key first. So the plan is: move up to get the key, then move left and down to the door, using the key to open it. Then go through the door to win.

But how to move up? Since I'm ""baba is you,"" I can move unless there's a stop. The ""stop"" is at 1 step to the left and 2 step up. So if I move up from my current position, say, to the first step up, is there a wall? The walls listed are at various positions, but the key is at 2 step up, and there's a wall at 2 steps to the right and 2 step up. So if I'm positioned to the left of that wall, moving up should be allowed.

Alternatively, maybe I need to rearrange the rules. For example, moving the ""is"" text block to create a new rule like ""key is win,"" making the key the win condition. But that would require moving the ""win"" rule somewhere else.

Another approach: since I'm Baba and can push objects, maybe I can push a text block to change the rules. The ""is"" rule at 6 steps right and 3 step up could be moved. If I move that ""is"" to combine with another rule, like making ""baba is win,"" but I need to reach that ""is"" block.

But the ""is"" block is 6 steps to the right and 3 step up, which is quite far. Maybe there's a closer ""is"" block at 1 step right and 1 step down. That one is closer. If I can move that ""is"" block and combine it with the ""baba"" rule at 3 steps left and 3 steps down, perhaps creating ""baba is win.""

To do that, I need to move the ""is"" block from 1 step right and 1 step down to be next to the ""baba"" rule. Then, combining them would make ""baba is win,"" making Baba the win condition. That way, I just need to reach Baba (which I am) to win.

So the steps would be:

1. Move to the ""is"" block at 1 step right and 1 step down.
2. Push that ""is"" block towards the ""baba"" rule at 3 steps left and 3 steps down.
3. Once combined, the rule becomes ""baba is win,"" so reaching Baba (myself) would win the level.

To do this, I need to navigate to the ""is"" block. The position of the ""is"" block is 1 step right and 1 step down from my current location. Assuming I'm at the origin, moving right once and down once would get me there. But I need to check if there are any obstacles.

Looking at the objects, there's a wall at 2 steps to the right and 3 step up, but that's above. The wall at 2 steps to the right and 2 step up is also there. However, the path to the ""is"" block at 1 step right and 1 step down might be clear. If I move right once and down once, I can pick up the ""is"" block. Then move left to the ""baba"" rule's position.

Once the ""is"" block is next to the ""baba"" rule, combining them would create the new rule ""baba is win."" Then, since I'm Baba, I can just stay in place and win.

Alternatively, if I can't move the ""is"" block directly, maybe I need to use other text blocks. The ""you"" rule is at 1 step left and 3 steps down. If I can move that to Baba, making him ""you,"" then I can control him and push the ""is"" block.

But this seems more complex. The first approach of making Baba the win condition by combining ""baba"" and ""is"" seems more straightforward.

So, the action plan is:

- Move right once to reach the ""is"" block at 1 step right and 1 step down.
- Then move left to the ""baba"" rule at 3 steps left and 3 steps down.
- Combine them to make ""baba is win.""
- Stay idle to win.

But how to navigate there? The current observation shows that the ""is"" block is 1 step to the right and 1 step down. So from my current position, moving right and then down would get me there. However, I need to ensure there are no stops in the way.

The ""stop"" rule is at 1 step to the left and 2 step up. So moving right and down shouldn't hit any stops. The walls are at specific positions, but they are either above or to the right, which shouldn't block the path down and left.

Therefore, the next action should be to move right to reach the ""is"" block.

Let's take a look at this Baba Is You level. The objective is usually to reach the WIN object, which is often labeled as a door or something similar. From the current observation, the active rule is still ""baba is you,"" meaning I can move Baba around and manipulate text blocks.

First, I need to check where the WIN object is. Looking at the objects, there's a rule `win` at 6 steps to the right and 3 steps up. But there's also a door at 4 steps to the left and 2 steps down. Wait, but in Baba Is You, the WIN could be any object that's defined as win, so I need to see if that door is the actual win condition. However, the active rules don't have anything overriding the default, so the win is still where the `win` rule is pointing.

Now, my position isn't specified here, but based on the objects listed, maybe I'm near the left side since there are rules and walls to the left and right. Let's see the key is at 1 step to the left and 2 steps up. Do I need the key? The door at 3 steps to the left and 2 steps down might be locked, but I don't see a ""LOCK"" rule here. So maybe the door isn't blocked. Alternatively, the `win` is at 6 steps right and 3 up, but there are walls blocking that path. The walls are at varying positions, so I need to navigate around them.

The key is at 1 left, 2 up. If I can get the key, maybe it opens a door, but I'm not sure. Let's look at the rules. The `stop` rule is at 2 left, 2 up. So anything at that position is stop, meaning I can't move through it. The `you` rule is at 2 left, 3 down, which is probably defining another object as ""you,"" but since I'm Baba and ""baba is you,"" maybe that's redundant or for another part of the level.

The main challenge is getting past the walls. The path to the `win` rule (6 right, 3 up) is blocked by walls at 2 right, 3 up and further right. Maybe I need to manipulate the rules to change the properties of those walls. For example, if I can make a wall into a ""stop"" or remove its ""wall"" property, I could walk through.

Looking at the available text blocks: there's an `is` rule at 5 right, 3 up. If I can move that `is` rule next to a wall and change its property, maybe I can reassign the wall's property. For instance, if I make ""wall is stop,"" then the wall would be stop, and I could push past it. But to do that, I need to move the `is` text block next to the wall and rewrite the rule.

Alternatively, if I can make myself (Baba) into something that can pass through walls, like ""baba is push"" or ""baba is win,"" but that might be more complex. Let's think step by step.

First, check my current position. Since the key is at 1 left, 2 up, maybe I'm near there. If I can pick up the key, that might help open a door. The door is at 3 left, 2 down. If I move left or down towards it, but there's a `stop` at 2 left, 2 up, which is a wall. So I need to go around that. Let's see the path: from my current position (assuming I'm near the key), moving left to get the key, but the key is at 1 left, 2 up. If I move left once, I can get the key. Then, maybe move down to the door.

Wait, but the door is at 3 left, 2 down. From where I am after getting the key, which is 1 left, 2 up, moving down two steps and left three steps would get to the door. But there's a wall at 2 left, 2 up (the stop rule's position), so I need to avoid that. Alternatively, maybe there's a path around the walls using the available rules.

Another approach: the `you` rule is at 2 left, 3 down. If I can move that `you` rule to Baba, making ""baba is you,"" but I already have that rule. Maybe combining it with another rule. For example, if I can make ""baba is win,"" then touching the door would make me win. But to do that, I need to move the `is` rule next to Baba and rewrite the rule.

Looking at the `is` rules: there's one at 5 right, 3 up. If I can move that `is` to where Baba is and change ""baba is you"" to ""baba is win,"" that would make me the win condition. But how do I move the `is` rule? I need to check if I can move text blocks. The tips say I can only move objects or text that are not defined as ""STOP"" or similar. The `is` rule itself isn't stopped, so I should be able to move it.

So the plan could be: move the `is` rule from 5 right, 3 up to next to Baba (assuming my position is near there) and change the rule from ""baba is you"" to ""baba is win."" That way, touching any object would make me win, but the door is the actual win object. Alternatively, change the door's property to win.

Alternatively, if I can make the door into a win by moving the `win` rule to the door's position. The current `win` rule is at 6 right, 3 up. If I move that `win` rule to the door's location (4 left, 2 down), then the door would be the win condition. To do that, I need to move the `win` rule text block to the door's position. But moving it would require pathing around walls.

This seems complicated. Let me recap:

- Current active rule: baba is you.
- WIN is at 6 right, 3 up, but blocked by walls.
- Door is at 4 left, 2 down. Not sure if it's a win.
- Key is at 1 left, 2 up. Maybe to open a door, but no lock mentioned.
- Need to manipulate rules to either remove walls, become win, or reposition win.

Possible steps:

1. Move the `is` rule from 5 right, 3 up to somewhere adjacent to a wall and change its property. For example, ""wall is stop"" so it becomes stop, allowing movement through. But where is the `is` rule? If I can move it next to a wall and rewrite the rule, that could work.

2. Alternatively, move the `win` rule to the door's location. To do that, I need to navigate to where the `win` rule is (6 right, 3 up), pick it up, and carry it to the door at 4 left, 2 down. But the path from 6 right, 3 up to 4 left, 2 down is blocked by walls. For example, from 6 right, 3 up, moving left to 5 right, 3 up (which has an `is` rule), then down to 5 right, 2 up, but there's a wall there. This seems tricky.

3. Use the key. If the door requires a key, but there's no ""key is win"" rule, so probably not. But getting the key might allow access to another part of the level.

Another angle: since ""baba is you,"" I can push objects if they're defined as push. But by default, walls are stop, so I can't push them. If I can change a wall to be push, then maybe I can move it out of the way. To do that, I need to create a rule like ""wall is push"" by moving the `is` rule next to a wall and rewriting it.

So, for example, move the `is` rule from 5 right, 3 up to a wall's position (say, 4 left, 2 up where the `wall` rule is), and change ""wall is [something]"" to ""wall is push."" Then I could push the wall. But this requires precise movement.

Alternatively, create a rule that makes ""baba is push,"" allowing me to push stop objects. But to do that, I need to write ""baba is push"" by moving the `is` rule next to Baba and rewriting the existing ""baba is you"" to ""baba is push you."" Wait, no. In Baba Is You, rules are in the format [Subject] IS [Property]. So to change ""baba is you"" to ""baba is push,"" I would need to move the `is` rule next to Baba and replace the property.

But how do I physically move the `is` rule? Let's see the positions:

- My current position isn't clear, but the `is` rule at 5 right, 3 up is a candidate. If I can move that `is` rule down and to the left to be next to Baba, then change the rule.

Assuming I'm near the key or the `is` rule, moving the `is` rule to be adjacent to a wall and changing its property. For example, moving the `is` from 5 right, 3 up to 4 right, 3 up (adjacent to a wall at 4 step to the left and 2 step up? Wait, the walls are at various positions. Maybe the wall at 4 step to the left and 2 step up is a different one. This is getting a bit confusing without a visual, but let's proceed.

If I can make a wall into a ""stop,"" then perhaps I can walk through it, but that doesn't help if it's blocking the path. Alternatively, making it ""push"" so I can move it.

Alternatively, the door at 4 left, 2 down is a `rule door` at 4 steps to the right and 3 steps down. Wait, in the current observation, the `door` rule is at 4 steps to the right and 3 steps down. The actual door object is at 4 step to the left and 2 steps down. So there's a discrepancy. Maybe the `door` rule defines where the door is. So if the `door` rule is at 4 right, 3 down, then the door is located there. But the object listed is ""door 4 step to the left and 2 steps down,"" which might be a separate instance.

This is getting complicated. Let me try to outline possible actions:

1. Move towards the `win` rule at 6 right, 3 up to pick it up and move it to the door's location. But path is blocked.

2. Move the `is` rule to reassign a wall's property. For example, make a wall into ""stop"" so I can walk through, or ""push"" to move it.

3. Use the key to open a door, but no lock mentioned.

4. Change ""baba is you"" to ""baba is win,"" making touching anything win, but the door is the actual win object.

Given the observations, the most feasible step seems to be moving the `is` rule to rewrite a wall's property. Let's focus on that.

The `is` rule is at 5 right, 3 up. If I can move this `is` rule to a wall's position and change its property. For example, the wall at 4 left, 2 up has a `wall` rule there. If I move the `is` rule next to that wall and change ""wall is [something]"" to ""wall is stop,"" but that would make it even more impassable. Alternatively, change it to ""wall is push,"" allowing me to move it.

Alternatively, target the `stop` rule at 3 left, 2 up. If I can change ""stop"" to something else, but the `stop` rule is a property, not a subject. The rules are [Subject] IS [Property]. So the `stop` rule is likely part of another object's definition, like ""wall is stop.""

Looking at the objects, the `wall` rule at 4 left, 2 up defines that wall as stop. So to remove the stop property, I need to rewrite that rule. To do that, I need to move the `is` rule next to that `wall` rule and change it from ""wall is stop"" to something else, like ""wall is push.""

So the steps would be:

- Move the `is` rule from 5 right, 3 up to 4 left, 2 up (adjacent to the `wall` rule).
- Change the rule from ""wall is stop"" to ""wall is push.""
- Now, the wall is pushable. I can then push it out of the way to access the path to the `win` rule.

But how to physically move the `is` rule? The `is` rule is at 5 right, 3 up. To get to 4 left, 2 up, I need to move left and down multiple steps, avoiding walls. The path might be:

From 5 right, 3 up: move left to 4 right, 3 up (which has a `win` rule at 6 right, 3 up—wait, no, the `win` rule is at 6 right, 3 up. So moving left from 5 right to 4 right, 3 up is possible. Then move left again to 3 right, 3 up, but check if there are walls. Looking at the objects, at 2 step to the right and 3 step up, there's a wall. So moving left from 5 right to 4 right, then 3 right, then 2 right, but there's a wall at 2 right, 3 up. So that path is blocked.

Alternative route: From the `is` at 5 right, 3 up, move down to 5 right, 2 up. Is there a wall there? The objects list a wall at 2 step up, but not specifically at 5 right, 2 up. So maybe possible. Then move left to 4 right, 2 up (adjacent to the `wall` rule). This would allow me to pick up the `is` rule and move it.

Once the `is` rule is at 4 left, 2 up (next to the `wall` rule), I can change the rule from ""wall is stop"" to ""wall is push."" Then, I can push the wall out of the way, creating a path to the `win` rule.

Alternatively, after making the wall pushable, push it left or right to clear the path.

This seems like a viable plan. So the actions needed would be:

1. Move towards the `is` rule at 5 right, 3 up.
2. Pick up the `is` rule and carry it to the `wall` rule at 4 left, 2 up.
3. Change the rule to ""wall is push.""
4. Push the wall to clear a path.
5. Navigate to the `win` rule at 6 right, 3 up.

But given the step-by-step actions required, the immediate next action would be to move towards the `is` rule or to the `wall` rule.

Given the current observation, the `is` rule is at 5 steps to the right and 3 steps up. If I'm positioned near the left side, I need to move right and up. However, the path might be blocked. Alternatively, if I'm near the `win` rule, moving left to get the `is` rule.

But without knowing my exact position, it's challenging. However, based on the objects listed, perhaps the player (Baba) is near the key or the `you` rule. Let's assume I'm near the `you` rule at 2 left, 3 down. To reach the `is` rule at 5 right, 3 up, I need to move right and up, avoiding walls.

Alternatively, if I can move the `you` rule to somewhere else to free up movement, but that might not be necessary.

Another possibility: Since ""baba is you,"" I can move any text block that's not stopped. The `is` rule at 5 right, 3 up is not stopped, so I can pick it up. To do that, I need to move adjacent to it.

Assuming I can move right and up to reach the `is` rule, then pick it up and move it left and down to the `wall` rule's location.

The immediate action would be to move right to get closer to the `is` rule. But based on previous actions, the user has been alternating between left and right, moving back and forth. Perhaps the correct approach is to focus on manipulating the `is` rule.

In the last observation, after moving right, the `is` rule is at 6 steps to the right and 3 steps up. Wait, no, the observation shows that after some moves, the `is` rule is at different positions. This is getting a bit too confusing without seeing the actual level layout.

Given the time I've spent and the need to provide an action, I'll go with moving the `is` rule to rewrite a wall's property. The most logical next step is to move right towards the `is` rule to pick it up. Alternatively, move left to reach the `wall` rule.

But considering the previous actions of left and right alternating, maybe the correct next move is to move left again to get closer to the `wall` rule where the `is` needs to be placed.

Alternatively, since the `is` rule is at 5 right, 3 up, and the `wall` rule is at 4 left, 2 up, the direction to move would be left and down. But navigating that path requires avoiding walls.

Given all this, the safest immediate action is to move left to get closer to the `is` rule or towards the wall that needs redefinition. However, without knowing the exact positions, I'll have to assume a direction. 

Looking at the latest observation, the `is` rule is at 5 steps to the right and 3 up. If I'm to the left of that, moving right would be necessary. Alternatively, if I'm below, moving up.

But since the user's previous actions were left and right, perhaps the correct next move is to move left to position the `is` rule correctly.

So, the chosen action is left.

Let's try to figure out how to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. The goal is usually to reach the ""win"" object, which is probably the door or something similar. Looking at the current observation, the active rule is ""baba is you"". That means whatever I move, it's treated as Baba.

First, I'll check the map layout again. There are several walls, keys, and doors scattered around. The ""win"" rule is located at 7 steps to the right and 3 steps up. But there's a wall blocking that path directly. So maybe I need to move the ""win"" rule to a different position or change some other rules.

Looking at the objects, there's a ""rule `is`"" at 6 steps right and 3 steps up. If I can move that ""is"" rule somewhere else, maybe I can create a new rule. For example, if I can make ""baba is win"", then touching the door (which is the win object) would make me win. But to do that, I need to manipulate the ""is"" text block.

Also, there's a key at 2 steps up. I might need to pick that up to unlock a door, but right now, the ""key"" rule is at 6 steps right and 1 step down. Maybe if I can move the key to a different spot, but I don't know if that's necessary yet.

The ""door"" is at 2 steps left and 2 steps down. The ""rule `door`"" is at 5 steps right and 3 steps down. So the door is to the left of me, but I might be blocked by walls. Let me see where I am. The ""baba"" rule is at 3 steps left and 3 steps down. Wait, no—the ""rule `baba`"" is at 3 steps left and 3 steps down. So maybe the player is adjacent to that? Or is the player's position not explicitly listed? Hmm, the observation lists objects and rules but not the player's position directly. Maybe I need to infer it based on the rules and other objects.

Assuming I'm the Baba object because ""baba is you"" is active. The ""rule `baba`"" is at 3 steps left and 3 steps down. If I need to reach the ""win"" at 7 steps right and 3 steps up, that's a long path blocked by walls. Alternatively, maybe I can change the ""win"" rule's position. The ""win"" rule is at 7 steps right and 3 steps up. If I can move that ""win"" rule closer, but to do that, I need to move the text block that says ""win"".

Wait, the ""rule `win`"" is at 7 steps right and 3 steps up. So it's a text block that defines what is win. If I can move that text block next to the door, then the door would become the win condition. But how do I move it? To move a text block, I have to push it unless it's marked as ""stop"". Looking at the objects, there's a ""stop"" rule at 1 step left and 2 step up. So some objects are ""stop"", meaning I can't push them. But the ""rule `win`"" is a text block, so if it's not stopped, I can move it.

Wait, the rules are ""baba is you"", which means I can move myself (Baba) and any text blocks that aren't stopped. The ""stop"" rule is at 1 step left and 2 step up, which is probably a wall or another object flagged as stop. So to move the ""win"" text block at 7 steps right and 3 steps up, I need to get to that position and push it. But the path there is blocked by walls. Let me check the path.

From my current position (assuming I'm at the position of the ""rule `baba`"" at 3 steps left and 3 steps down), I need to move right to get to the ""win"" rule. But between me and the ""win"" rule, there are walls. For example, at 2 steps right and 3 steps up is a wall. So maybe I need to rearrange the walls by moving their rules.

The ""rule `wall`"" is at 3 steps left and 2 steps up. If I can move that ""wall"" rule, I could remove the wall blocking my path. But again, to move a text block, it has to not be stopped. The ""stop"" rule is at 1 step left and 2 step up, which might be a separate wall. So perhaps I can move the ""wall"" rule to a different location to create a path.

Alternatively, maybe I can change the ""win"" rule to be the door. The door is at 2 steps left and 2 steps down. The ""rule `door`"" is at 5 steps right and 3 steps down. If I can move the ""win"" rule to be next to the door, then touching the door would make me win. To do that, I need to pick up the ""win"" text block (which is at 7 steps right and 3 steps up) and move it to the door's position or near it.

But moving the ""win"" block requires getting past the walls. Let's see. From my current position (assuming I'm at 3 left, 3 down), moving right towards the ""win"" rule at 7 right, 3 up. The path is blocked by walls at 2 right, 3 up; 2 right, 2 up; etc. So perhaps I need to move the ""wall"" rules to remove those obstacles.

The ""rule `wall`"" is at 3 left, 2 up. If I can move that rule to a different spot, say next to the wall blocking my path, then the wall would no longer be there. But how do I reach that ""rule `wall`""? To get to 3 left, 2 up, I need to move left and up. But there's a ""stop"" rule at 1 left, 2 up, which might be blocking that path.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the ""is"" rule to create a new rule. For example, if I can make ""baba is win"", then touching the door would win. To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule to combine with ""baba"" and ""win"". The ""rule `is`"" is at 6 right, 3 up. If I can move that ""is"" block next to ""baba"" and ""win"", then I can create the new rule.

But again, moving the ""is"" block requires getting past the walls. Let's see. The ""is"" block is at 6 right, 3 up. To get there from my current position (3 left, 3 down), I need to move right multiple times and up. However, there's a wall at 2 right, 3 up, so I can't go straight up. Maybe I can move the wall rule first.

Alternatively, maybe I can push the ""is"" block by moving towards it. Since ""baba is you"", I can push the ""is"" block if it's not stopped. The ""stop"" rule is at 1 left, 2 up, which is not in the way of the ""is"" block. So if I move right towards the ""is"" block at 6 right, 3 up, I can push it. But the path there is blocked by walls. For example, at 2 right, 3 up is a wall. So unless I remove that wall, I can't get to the ""is"" block.

This seems complicated. Maybe there's a simpler way. Let's think about the key. The key is at 2 steps up. If I can pick up the key, then maybe I can unlock a door. The door is at 2 steps left and 2 steps down. But the door is probably locked unless I have the key. The ""rule `door`"" is at 5 steps right and 3 steps down. So the door's behavior is defined by that rule. If I can change the door's rule to, say, ""door is key"", then having the key would allow passage. But I need to manipulate the ""door"" rule.

Alternatively, if I can make the door act as a win condition. If I can create ""door is win"", then touching the door would make me win. To do that, I need to move the ""win"" rule to the door's position or create a new rule with ""door is win"".

But how to do that? Let's see. The ""win"" rule is at 7 right, 3 up. If I can move that to the door's location (2 left, 2 down), but that's a big distance. Alternatively, create a new rule ""door is win"" using the ""is"" rule. The ""is"" rule is at 6 right, 3 up. So if I can move ""is"" next to ""door"" and ""win"", but I don't have a ""door"" text block in my current vicinity except for the ""rule `door`"" at 5 right, 3 down.

This is getting a bit tricky. Maybe I should try to move the ""is"" rule to a position where I can create a new rule. For example, if I can get ""is"" next to ""baba"" and ""win"", then ""baba is win"" would make me win when I touch the win object. But to do that, I need to move the ""is"" block.

Looking at the current positions, the ""is"" block is at 6 right, 3 up. If I move left from there, towards my current position (3 left, 3 down), maybe I can reposition it. But the path is blocked by walls. Alternatively, maybe I can push the ""is"" block to the left by moving into it. Since I'm Baba and can move, if I move left towards the ""is"" block at 6 right, 3 up, but that's to the right of me. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the directions. The positions are described as steps right/left and up/down from my current position?

Hmm, this is confusing. Let me try to visualize the map. The player (Baba) is likely at the position of the ""rule `baba`"" which is at 3 steps left and 3 steps down. So relative to me, that's to the left and below. Wait, no—if the ""rule `baba`"" is at 3 steps left and 3 steps down, that means from my current position, I need to move left 3 and down 3 to reach that rule. But that would place me at the edge of the map. Maybe the coordinates are relative to the player's position. Alternatively, the game's grid has certain positions, and the player is somewhere on that grid.

This is getting too vague. Maybe I should focus on possible actions. The available actions are idle, up, right, down, left. The previous actions were a series of left, right movements, which might be trying to position the player near key objects.

Looking at the latest observation, after several left and right movements, the player is now at a position where the ""rule `baba`"" is at 3 steps left and 3 steps down. The ""win"" rule is at 7 right, 3 up. The ""is"" rule is at 6 right, 3 up. So if I can move the ""is"" rule to be next to ""baba"" and ""win"", I can create the ""baba is win"" rule.

To do that, I need to move the ""is"" block from 6 right, 3 up to a position where it's between ""baba"" and ""win"". For example, if ""baba"" is at 3 left, 3 down, and ""win"" is at 7 right, 3 up, the ""is"" block at 6 right, 3 up is between them vertically. If I can move the ""is"" block one step left to 5 right, 3 up, then I could have ""baba is win"" if the blocks are adjacent.

But how to move the ""is"" block? Since I'm Baba and ""baba is you"", I can push text blocks that aren't stopped. The ""stop"" rule is at 1 left, 2 up, which isn't near the ""is"" block. So if I move towards the ""is"" block, I can push it. For example, if I move right towards the ""is"" block at 6 right, 3 up, but there's a wall at 2 right, 3 up blocking the path. So I need to remove that wall first.

The wall at 2 right, 3 up is defined by the ""rule `wall`"" at 3 left, 2 up. To remove that wall, I need to move the ""rule `wall`"" to a different position. If I can move the ""wall"" rule, then the wall at 2 right, 3 up would disappear.

The ""rule `wall`"" is at 3 left, 2 up. To get there, I need to move left and up from my current position. But there's a ""stop"" rule at 1 left, 2 up, which might be a wall or another stopped object. If I can move past that, I can reach the ""rule `wall`"" and move it.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the ""is"" rule to create a new rule that removes the stop property. For example, ""stop is nothing"", but that might be too advanced.

This seems like a lot of steps. Maybe a simpler approach is to focus on moving the ""win"" rule to the door. The door is at 2 left, 2 down, and the ""rule `door`"" is at 5 right, 3 down. If I can move the ""win"" rule to be near the door, then touching the door would make me win. The ""win"" rule is at 7 right, 3 up. To move it to the door's location (2 left, 2 down), I need to push it left and down, but that's a long distance and likely blocked by walls.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule that makes the door win by combining the ""door"" and ""win"" rules with an ""is"" block. For example, if I can create ""door is win"", then the door would be the win object. To do that, I need to move the ""is"" block next to ""door"" and ""win"".

The ""door"" rule is at 5 right, 3 down. The ""win"" rule is at 7 right, 3 up. The ""is"" rule is at 6 right, 3 up. So if I can move the ""is"" block from 6 right, 3 up to 5 right, 3 down (next to the ""door"" rule), then I can create ""door is win"". But how to get there?

The path from 6 right, 3 up to 5 right, 3 down requires moving left and down. However, there's a wall at 2 right, 3 up, and other walls blocking the way. Unless I remove those walls by moving their rules, this path is blocked.

This is getting really complex. Maybe I should try to move the ""is"" block to a more strategic position. Let's see. The ""is"" block is at 6 right, 3 up. If I move left once to 5 right, 3 up, that might position it between the ""win"" rule (7 right, 3 up) and the ""baba"" rule (3 left, 3 down). But I need to see if that helps.

Alternatively, moving the ""is"" block down to 6 right, 2 up, which might be near the key or other objects. But I'm not sure.

Another idea: If I can make myself a key, then maybe I can unlock the door. To do that, create ""baba is key"". The key is at 2 step up. So if I can move the ""is"" block next to ""baba"" and ""key"", then I can become a key. Let's see. The ""key"" rule is at 5 right, 1 step down. The ""baba"" rule is at 3 left, 3 down. The ""is"" block is at 6 right, 3 up. It's a bit far, but maybe possible.

To get the ""is"" block to the area near ""baba"" and ""key"", I need to move it left and down. But again, blocked by walls.

Maybe the key isn't necessary right now. Let's try to focus on the immediate goal. The ""win"" rule is at 7 right, 3 up, but there's a wall there. If I can remove that wall by moving its rule, which is at 3 left, 2 up. To reach that ""wall"" rule, I need to move left and up from my current position. But the ""stop"" rule at 1 left, 2 up is blocking that path. How can I get past the ""stop"" rule?

If the ""stop"" rule is making certain objects immovable, maybe I can change its property. For example, if I can make ""stop is nothing"", then the stop rule wouldn't block movement. But that requires creating a new rule, which needs an ""is"" block.

Alternatively, if I can move the ""stop"" rule away. The ""stop"" rule is at 1 left, 2 up. If I can push it, but since it's a stop rule, maybe I can't. Wait, the rules say I can only move objects or text blocks that are not defined as ""STOP"" or similar immovable properties. So if an object is ""STOP"", I can't move it. But the ""stop"" rule itself is a text block. If it's not stopped, I can move it. However, if the ""stop"" rule is applied to an object, that object can't be moved. But the text block for ""stop"" is separate.

This is getting too convoluted. Maybe I should try to move the ""is"" block towards the ""win"" and ""baba"" to create ""baba is win"". Let's attempt that.

The ""is"" block is at 6 right, 3 up. If I move left once to 5 right, 3 up, then I'm next to the ""win"" block at 7 right, 3 up. But that's not adjacent. Wait, positions are in steps, so moving left from 6 right would be 5 right. The ""win"" is at 7 right, so there's still a gap. Maybe I need to get closer.

Alternatively, move the ""is"" block down to 6 right, 2 up. Then, perhaps next to the ""key"" rule at 5 right, 1 step down. Not sure.

Another approach: Since the player is likely at the position of the ""","

Let's try to figure out what to do next in this Baba Is You level. The active rule is still ""baba is you,"" which means I can move Baba around. The goal is usually to reach a ""win"" object, but I need to check if any rules have changed that.

Looking at the objects on the map, the ""win"" rule is at 7 steps to the right and 3 steps up. But there are walls blocking the path. There's also a door at 2 steps to the left and 2 steps down. Doors are usually blocked by ""stop"" rules, but I need to see if anything overrides that.

I see a key at 2 step up. Maybe I need to pick that up to unlock the door. However, moving towards the key might be tricky because of the walls. Let me check the positions again. The key is in the same vertical line as the ""win"" rule but shifted left. The walls are to the right and left, so maybe moving left or right is necessary.

Wait, there's a ""rule `is`"" block at 1 step to the right and 1 step down. If I can move that ""is"" block, I could potentially create a new rule. For example, if I move ""is"" next to ""baba"" and ""win,"" I could make ""baba is win,"" which would mean Baba itself is the win condition. That might let me step on the door or somewhere else as the win.

But first, I need to reach that ""is"" block. The current position of Baba isn't clear from the observation, but the last action was ""right,"" so maybe Baba is near the right side. Alternatively, I might need to navigate around the walls. The walls are spread out, so maybe moving up or down could open a path.

Another thought: the ""you"" rule is at 1 step to the left and 3 steps down. Since ""baba is you,"" maybe combining that with other rules could help. For instance, if I can make ""baba is win,"" then stepping on the door (which is a ""door"" object) might count as winning if ""baba"" is ""win.""

To do that, I need to move the ""is"" block. Let's see its location: 1 step to the right and 1 step down from where? Assuming the current position of Baba is somewhere, but without knowing exactly, I have to make an educated guess. Maybe moving left or right to reach the ""is"" block.

Alternatively, the key at 2 step up might be necessary to unlock the door. If I can get the key, then perhaps the door isn't a ""stop"" anymore. But how to reach the key? The path might be blocked by walls. Let's check the positions again.

The key is at 2 step up. There's a ""stop"" rule at 1 step to the left and 2 step up. So moving left from the key's position would hit a ""stop"" wall. Maybe moving right first? But the walls to the right are at 2 steps to the right and 2 step up. So perhaps the key is accessible if I can navigate around the ""stop"" wall.

Alternatively, maybe the ""rule `is`"" block at 1 step to the right and 1 step down can be moved to create a new rule. If I move that ""is"" next to ""baba"" and ""win,"" that could work. So the action would involve moving the ""is"" block, but I need to know how to do that in the game. In Baba Is You, you can push text blocks if they're not defined as ""stop"" or similar. So if the ""is"" block isn't stopped, I can move it.

Assuming I can move the ""is"" block, the next step would be to move it adjacent to ""baba"" and ""win"" to create ""baba is win."" Once that rule is active, stepping on the door (which is a ""door"" object) might trigger the win condition since Baba is now win.

So the plan is: move to the ""is"" block at 1 step to the right and 1 step down, push it next to ""baba"" and ""win,"" then head to the door. But how to get there? The current active rules still have ""baba is you,"" so movement is possible unless blocked by ""stop.""

Looking at the map, there's a ""stop"" rule at 1 step to the left and 2 step up. That might block movement left from the key's position. So perhaps moving down to the ""is"" block first. Let me visualize the grid.

If I'm currently positioned somewhere, maybe the best move is to go down to the ""is"" block at 1 step right and 1 step down. Then move it left or right to concatenate with ""baba"" and ""win."" For example, if ""baba"" is at 4 step to the left and 3 steps down, and ""win"" is at 5 steps to the right and 3 step up, maybe arranging the ""is"" between them.

Alternatively, the ""you"" rule is at 1 step to the left and 3 steps down. Maybe combining ""baba is you"" with ""you is win"" could work, but I don't see a ""win"" rule nearby to link.

Another angle: the door at 2 step to the left and 2 steps down. If I can make the door a ""win"" by placing a rule next to it, like ""door is win."" But to do that, I need to move the ""is"" block next to the door and ""win.""

But the ""win"" rule is already at 7 steps to the right and 3 step up, which is far from the door. Maybe it's better to focus on making Baba the win condition.

So, the immediate action should be to move towards the ""is"" block at 1 step right and 1 step down. From the current observation, Baba's position isn't specified, but the last action was ""right,"" so maybe Baba is near the right side. To reach the ""is"" block, moving left or down might be necessary.

Assuming I need to move left to get to the ""is"" block, the action would be ""left."" Alternatively, if down is needed, then ""down."" But based on the last observation, after moving right multiple times, the position of Baba might be such that moving left brings them to the ""is"" block.

In the previous steps, the user kept moving left and right, and the map's walls and rules are shifting positions each time. It seems like the level is dynamically changing based on the player's movements, which is common in Baba Is You.

Given that, the critical move is to interact with the ""is"" block to create a new rule. The most straightforward way is to move the ""is"" block next to ""baba"" and ""win."" Since the ""win"" rule is far to the right, perhaps moving the ""is"" block to the left of ""baba"" and then combining it with ""win"" by moving it further right.

But how to do that in one move? The player can only move one step at a time, so the sequence would involve moving to the ""is"" block's location, then pushing it into place.

Given the current observation, the ""is"" block is at 1 step to the right and 1 step down. If Baba is positioned to the left of that, moving right once would reach it. Alternatively, if below, moving down.

But without knowing Baba's exact position, it's challenging. However, the previous actions suggest a pattern of moving left and right to navigate. Given that the last few observations show the map shifting, perhaps the solution requires a specific sequence of moving blocks.

Another possibility: the ""key"" at 2 step up. If I can get the key, then maybe the door isn't a stop anymore. But the door is at 2 step to the left and 2 steps down. So moving left and down from the key's position might reach the door. However, there's a ""stop"" rule at 1 step to the left and 2 step up, which could block movement left from the key.

Alternatively, after getting the key, use it on the door. But in Baba Is You, keys usually unlock doors if the door is defined as ""lock"" or similar. However, in this case, the door's rule is ""door,"" and there's no ""lock"" mentioned. So maybe the key isn't necessary unless there's a specific rule requiring it.

Given the time I've spent and the previous failed attempts, the most promising action is to interact with the ""is"" block to create a new rule. So the chosen action would be to move towards that ""is"" block. Since it's at 1 step to the right and 1 step down, the appropriate move might be ""down"" first to get to the correct row, then ""right.""

But based on the latest observation, the ""is"" block is 1 step to the right and 1 step down from wherever Baba is currently. If the last action was ""right,"" maybe Baba is now positioned such that moving down and then right would reach the ""is"" block.

Alternatively, if the ""is"" block is directly below, moving ""down"" once would get there. Then, push it left or right to concatenate with the other rules.

Given the uncertainty in Baba's exact position, but needing to take an action, the safest bet is to move towards the ""is"" block. So, the action would be ""down"" to reach the row where the ""is"" block is located, then ""right"" to get next to it. However, since the system requires a single action per step, I have to choose the immediate next move.

Assuming that moving down from the current position would place Baba next to the ""is"" block, then ""down"" would be the action. Alternatively, if the ""is"" is to the right and down, maybe ""down"" then ""right,"" but only one action is allowed.

Given the previous pattern of moving left and right, and the latest observation showing the ""is"" block at 1 step right and 1 step down, the best action is probably ""down"" to move towards that block.

The active rule is still ""baba is you,"" so I can move around as Baba. The goal is usually to reach the ""win"" object, but I need to check if that's still the case. Let me look at the objects on the map.

Looking at the current observation, the ""win"" rule is at 7 steps to the right and 4 steps up. There's also a door that might be a win condition if the rules have changed. But right now, the active rule is ""baba is you,"" so I can move as Baba.

I see a key at 3 steps up. Do I need to pick up the key to unlock something? The door is at 2 steps left and 1 step down, but the door's rule is at 5 steps right and 2 steps down, which is ""door is door,"" so it's probably a normal door that needs to be pushed or maybe requires a key. But I don't have the key yet—wait, the key is at 3 steps up. Let me check where Baba's position is. Since the observations mention objects relative to Baba, but the exact position of Baba isn't specified here. Hmm, that's a problem. Without knowing where I am, it's harder to navigate.

Wait, in previous observations, the user's moves (like right, left, down) changed the map's perspective. Maybe the map is static, and the player's position is changing relative to the objects. So when I move right, the objects' positions are described from my new perspective.

In the last move, the assistant moved down, and now the observation shows some walls and rules adjusted. The key is now at 3 steps up. If I move up towards the key, maybe I can get it. Then, with the key, I could potentially move the door or unlock it. But the door's rule is still ""door is door,"" so maybe it's a stop unless modified.

Alternatively, maybe the real goal is to reach the ""win"" rule. Since ""win"" is an object, perhaps touching it makes me win. The ""win"" is at 7 steps right and 4 steps up. But the path is blocked by walls. Let me see the layout.

From the current observation:

- Walls are at various positions. To the right, there's a wall at 2 steps right, 3 step up, and others. Upwards, there's a wall at 2 steps right and 4 step up, which is where the ""win"" rule is. So the way to the win is blocked by a wall at 4 step up. Unless I can move that wall by changing the rules.

The ""is"" rule is at 6 steps right and 4 step up. If I can move the ""is"" text block, I could change a rule. For example, if I make ""wall is not stop,"" then the wall wouldn't block me. But to do that, I need to move the ""is"" text block and combine it with ""wall"" and ""stop"" or another property.

Alternatively, maybe I can make myself ""key"" so I can pick up the key without moving it. But the current rules are ""baba is you."" If I can create a new rule like ""baba is key,"" then I could pick up the key. To do that, I need to move the ""is"" text block next to ""baba"" and ""key.""

Looking at the current positions:

- ""is"" is at 6 steps right and 4 step up.
- ""key"" is at 3 step up.
- ""baba"" is probably at the starting position, but since the observations show rules and objects relative to the player's position, maybe the player is near the lower part. For example, if the player is at the origin, then the ""win"" is up and to the right, but walls are blocking the path.

Wait, the observation mentions ""rule `baba` 3 step to the left and 3 steps down."" So the ""baba"" text block is 3 left and 3 down from the player's current position. Since the active rule is ""baba is you,"" the player is Baba. So to move Baba, the player needs to move in directions relative to their position.

In the last move, the assistant moved down, leading to this new observation. Now, the key is at 3 steps up. If I move up three times, I can reach the key. But let me check if there are any stops in the way. The walls are at 2 steps right and various positions. If I'm moving up, the path might be clear except for the wall at 2 steps right and 4 step up (which is the ""win"" position). So maybe moving up towards the key is safe.

Alternatively, after getting the key, I could move to the door and use the key to unlock it. But the door's rule is ""door is door,"" so unless I change it to ""door is key"" or something, it won't open. But to change the door's rule, I need to move the ""is"" text block next to the door and the key.

Another approach: Since ""baba is you,"" maybe I can create a new rule like ""you is win"" to make touching anything a win. But I need to move the ""is"" text block to do that. For example, move ""is"" next to ""you"" and ""win"" to make ""you is win.""

Looking at the current positions:

- ""you"" is at 1 step to the left and 2 steps down.
- ""win"" is at 7 steps right and 4 step up.
- ""is"" is at 6 steps right and 4 step up.

If I can move the ""is"" block from (6r,4u) to be next to ""you"" (which is 1l,2d) and ""win"" (7r,4u), that might be tricky. The distances are quite far. Maybe it's easier to first reach the ""is"" block and then rearrange the rules.

Alternatively, let's focus on getting the key first. The key is at 3 step up. From the current position, moving up once would get me closer. But I need to check if there are any stops. The walls are at 2 steps right and 3 step up, and other positions. If I'm facing the key, moving up should be possible unless there's a stop in the way. Since the key isn't a stop, and the player can move past non-stop objects, moving up towards the key makes sense.

So the steps would be:

1. Move up to reach the key at 3 step up.
2. Pick up the key (if possible by default, since you can move over keys).
3. Then, move to the door and use the key to unlock it, possibly by changing the door's rule to ""key"" or similar.
4. Alternatively, create a new rule to make yourself the win condition.

But first, let's focus on reaching the key. The current observation after moving down shows the key at 3 step up. So moving up once would get closer. Wait, in the current observation, the key is at 3 step up. If the player is at position (0,0), then moving up three times would reach the key. However, need to ensure the path is clear.

Looking at the walls:

- At 2 steps right and 3 step up: there's a wall.
- The player's current position isn't explicitly stated, but the objects are relative. If the player is near the lower left, moving up towards the key (3u) might be possible without hitting walls.

Alternatively, maybe the key is in a different direction. Let me parse the positions again.

In the current observation:

- ""key"" is at 3 step up.
- ""is"" is at 6 steps right and 4 step up.
- ""win"" is at 7 steps right and 4 step up.
- ""door"" is at 2 step left and 1 step down.
- ""baba"" is at 3 step left and 3 steps down (relative to the player).

Assuming the player is at the origin (0,0), then:

- Key is at (0, 3).
- ""is"" is at (6,4).
- ""win"" is at (7,4).
- ""door"" is at (-2, -1).
- ""baba"" text block is at (-3,-3).

But the player is Baba, so they are at (0,0), and the objects are positioned relative to that. So to move towards the key at (0,3), the player needs to move up three times. However, there's a wall at (2,3), which is two steps to the right and three steps up. So if the player is at (0,0), moving up three steps would take them to (0,3), which is where the key is. But is there a wall in the way?

The walls are:

- wall 2 steps to the right and 3 step up: at (2,3).
- wall 2 steps to the right and 2 step up: at (2,2).
- wall 2 steps to the right and 1 step up: at (2,1).
- wall 2 steps to the right: at (2,0).

So the path up from (0,0) to (0,3) is clear except for the wall at (2,3), which is to the right. If the player is moving straight up, they won't encounter that wall. So moving up three times should reach the key.

Once the key is obtained, the player can then move to the door at (-2,-1). But the door is at (-2,-1), which is two steps left and one step down from the player's current position (0,0). However, there's a ""stop"" rule at 1 step to the left and 2 step up. Not sure if that affects movement.

Alternatively, after getting the key, the player can move to the ""is"" rule at (6,4) and rearrange the rules. For example, move the ""is"" to combine with ""baba"" and ""win"" to make ""baba is win,"" making touching anything a win. But that requires moving the ""is"" block next to ""baba"" and ""win.""

Given the complexity, perhaps the quickest way is to pick up the key and then use it to unlock the door. But how?

The door's rule is ""door is door,"" so it's a normal door. In Baba Is You, usually, doors can be pushed if they're not stopped. But since ""door"" is a stop unless modified, the player might need to change the door's rule to ""door is push"" or remove the ""stop"" property.

Alternatively, if the player has the key, they might need to place it near the door to unlock it. But the game mechanics for keys might require placing the key object on the door to unlock it, which would involve moving the key block adjacent to the door.

Given that, after obtaining the key, the player should move to the door's position (-2,-1) and place the key there. However, the key is an object, and in the game, you can push objects if they're not stopped. Since ""key"" isn't defined as stop, the player can move it.

So the plan is:

1. Move up three times to get the key at (0,3).
2. Move left twice and down once to reach the door at (-2,-1).
3. Place the key next to the door to unlock it.
4. Then move through the door to the win position.

But how to unlock the door? In Baba Is You, you might need to change the door's rule to ""door is key"" or similar. To do that, the player needs to move the ""is"" text block next to ""door"" and ""key.""

After obtaining the key, the player can move to the ""is"" rule at (6,4) and rearrange it. For example, move ""is"" to connect ""door"" and ""key"" to make ""door is key."" Then the door would become pushable or unlockable.

Alternatively, create a rule ""key is win"" so that touching the key makes you win, but that's not necessary if the goal is already a win object.

This is getting complicated. Let's focus on the immediate steps.

Current position after moving down: key is at 3 step up. So the first action should be to move up towards the key.

But wait, in the last observation, after moving down, the key is now at 3 step up. So moving up once would get closer. Let me check the exact positions again.

In the current observation:

- The key is at 3 step up.
- The player is presumably at (0,0).
- Moving up once brings them to (0,1).
- Next up to (0,2).
- Then up to (0,3) to get the key.

But there's a wall at (2,3), which is two steps to the right and three steps up. If the player is moving straight up, they won't hit that wall. So moving up three times should be safe.

Once the key is at the player's position, they can then move to the door. But the door is at (-2,-1). So from (0,3), move left twice to (-2,3), then down four times to (-2,-1). Along the way, need to check for stops. The ""stop"" rule is at 1 step to the left and 2 step up, which is (-1,2). So moving left twice from (0,3) would go through (-1,3) and (-2,3). The stop is at (-1,2), which is above, so no collision. Then moving down to (-2,-1).

Once at the door, place the key adjacent to it. Then, move the ""is"" rule to make ""door is key."" Then the door can be pushed through.

Alternatively, after getting the key, move to the ""is"" rule at (6,4) and rearrange it. To do that, the player would need to move right six times and up four times, which is a long way, but possible.

Another option: Since ""baba is you,"" maybe create a rule ""you is win"" so that touching anything makes you win. To do that, move the ""is"" rule next to ""you"" and ""win."" The ""you"" is at 1 step to the left and 2 steps down, and ""win"" is at 7 steps right and 4 steps up. That's a significant distance, so maybe not feasible.

Given the time constraints, perhaps the best immediate action is to move up to get the key. So the next action should be ""up.""

Let's try to figure out what to do here. The game is Baba Is You, and right now the active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I can move and manipulate other objects by moving the text blocks.

Looking at the current observation, the key is at 2 step up. There's also a door somewhere, and I need to figure out how to reach it. But first, the walls are blocking my path. The walls are positioned to the left and right, so I might need to move the ""is"" rule or other text blocks to change the game rules.

The key is at 2 step up. If I can get to that key, maybe I can use it to unlock the door. But how do I get past the walls? The walls are either stop objects or part of other rules. The ""stop"" rule is at 1 step to the left and 2 step up. Since ""stop"" makes objects immovable, I can't pass through them unless I change the rule. 

The ""is"" rule is at 6 steps to the right and 3 step up. If I can move that ""is"" rule, maybe I can create a new rule. For example, if I take the ""is"" text block and combine it with ""wall"" or another object, I can change what walls do. But wait, the ""baba is you"" rule means I can move text blocks that aren't stopped. The ""stop"" rule is at 1 step left, 2 step up. So I need to check if the ""is"" rule is movable. Since there's no ""stop"" on the ""is"" rule, I can move it.

If I move the ""is"" rule next to the ""key,"" maybe I can make a new rule like ""key is you"" or ""key is win."" Let me think. The goal is usually to reach the ""win"" object, which is a door in this case. If I can make the key into a win condition, then grabbing the key would make me win. Alternatively, if I can make myself a key, then I could pick up the key and use it on the door.

Alternatively, maybe I can make the door not a stop. The door is at 2 step left and 2 steps down. If I can change the ""door is stop"" rule, that would help. Looking at the objects, there's a ""rule `door` 5 steps to the right and 3 steps down."" So the door's rule is probably ""door is stop"" or something similar. If I can move that rule away or change it, the door becomes passable.

Another approach: since ""baba is you,"" I can push objects. The key is at 2 step up. If I move up, I can grab the key. But there's a wall at 2 steps to the right and 2 step up. Wait, looking at the map, the walls are positioned such that moving up might be blocked. Let me map out the positions.

The player (Baba) is probably at the starting position, but the exact location isn't specified here. Assuming the player is somewhere in the grid, let's focus on the key at 2 step up. To get there, if there's a wall in the way, I need to rearrange the rules. For example, if there's a wall at 2 step up, maybe it's because of a ""wall is stop"" rule. If I can move that rule, the wall becomes movable.

Alternatively, if I can create a ""key is push"" or ""key is you,"" then maybe I can use the key to interact with the door. But the main issue is navigating the walls. 

The ""is"" rule is at 6 steps to the right and 3 step up. If I move that ""is"" rule next to the ""key"" at 2 step up, I can make a new rule. For example, moving ""is"" to the key's position and combining them into ""key is you,"" making the key controllable. Then I could pick up the key and carry it to the door. But how do I move the ""is"" rule there? The player would need to move horizontally or vertically to reach it.

Alternatively, if I can make the wall a stop, but that's not helpful. Maybe making the wall not a stop. Wait, the existing rules include ""wall is stop"" at 2 step left and 2 step up. If I can remove that rule or change it, the wall becomes passable. To do that, I need to move the ""wall is stop"" rule away or destroy it. But how? Since ""baba is you,"" I can push text blocks. So if I move the ""rule `wall` 2 step left and 2 step up"" somewhere else, that rule would be deactivated.

So the plan could be:

1. Move the ""is"" rule to near the ""wall is stop"" rule.
2. Use the ""is"" rule to change ""wall"" to something else, like removing the ""stop"" property.

Alternatively, move the ""is"" rule to the ""key"" to make ""key is you,"" then grab the key and go to the door.

But the door is at 2 step left and 2 steps down. There's a ""rule `door` 5 steps to the right and 3 steps down,"" which probably defines the door's properties. If I can change that rule to ""door is you"" or ""door is win,"" then stepping on it would win the game. But to do that, I need to move the ""door"" rule.

Another angle: since the active rule is ""baba is you,"" I can push objects. The key is at 2 step up. If I move up, I can pick up the key. But the path might be blocked by walls. Let's check the path to the key.

Assuming the player is to the left of the key, moving up would take them to the key. But there's a wall at 2 steps to the right and 2 step up. Wait, the walls are positioned such that moving up might require going around them. Maybe the key is behind a wall, so I need to rearrange the rules to remove the wall's stop property.

Alternatively, if I can make the wall a pushable object by changing its rule. For example, if the wall's rule is ""wall is stop,"" changing it to ""wall is push"" would let me move it out of the way.

To do that, I need to move the ""wall is stop"" rule. The ""is"" rule is at 6 steps to the right and 3 step up. If I can move the ""is"" rule next to the ""wall is stop"" rule, then I can combine them to create a new rule, like ""stop is you"" or something that nullifies the stop property.

But this is getting a bit complicated. Let's break it down step by step.

Current rules affecting movement:

- ""baba is you"": I can move and push text blocks.
- ""wall is stop"": Walls are immovable.
- ""door is ..."": Probably ""door is stop"" or ""door is win.""

The key is at 2 step up. If I can reach it, maybe I can use it to unlock the door. But how?

Alternatively, if I can create a ""key is win"" rule, then grabbing the key would make me win. To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to the ""key"" and combine them into ""key is win.""

So the steps would be:

1. Move the ""is"" rule (at 6 steps right, 3 up) towards the key (2 step up). Since the player is likely between these positions, moving right or left to reposition the ""is"" rule.

But in the previous observations, the user has been moving left, right, up, down. The last action was ""down,"" which moved the player down, perhaps to a new position.

In the current observation, after moving down, the player's new position might have different nearby objects. The key is still at 2 step up. The ""is"" rule is at 6 steps right, 3 up. The player needs to navigate to where they can move the ""is"" rule next to the key.

Alternatively, maybe the player is near the ""is"" rule and can move it left or right to combine with other objects.

Another possibility: The door is at 2 step left and 2 steps down. If I can make the door not a stop, I can walk through it. To do that, I need to change the door's rule. The existing door rule is at 5 steps right and 3 steps down: ""rule `door` 5 steps to the right and 3 steps down."" So the rule is probably ""door is stop"" or ""door is win."" If I can move that rule away, the door's behavior changes.

Alternatively, create a ""door is you"" rule, which would make the door controllable, but that doesn't necessarily make it a win condition. To make winning by touching the door, the rule should be ""win is door"" or ""door is win.""

So, if I can move the ""win"" rule (which is at 7 steps right, 3 step up) to be next to the door, that could work. But the player needs to reach that position.

This is quite complex. Let's consider the immediate actions. The player is likely near the ""is"" rule. If they move the ""is"" rule to the key's location, they can create a new rule. For example, moving ""is"" to the key's position and combining them into ""key is win,"" making the key a win condition. Then, picking up the key would make the player win.

Alternatively, move ""is"" to the door's rule to change its property.

But the key is at 2 step up, and the ""is"" rule is at 6 steps right, 3 step up. The player's current position isn't specified, but based on previous actions, they might be moving towards the key.

In the last move, the user did ""down,"" which might have brought them closer to the key. Now, the observation shows the key at 2 step up. So moving up would get the player to the key. But there's a wall at 2 steps to the right and 2 step up. Wait, the walls are at various positions, so maybe the path is clear.

Alternatively, if the player moves up, they can reach the key. Let's check the path. If the player is one step below the key, moving up once would get them there. But if there's a wall in between, they need to move the wall's rule.

Another approach: Since the key is at 2 step up, and the player is maybe one step away, the best action is to move up to grab the key. But the observation shows that after moving down, the player's position might have changed. Let's assume that moving up is possible now.

So the chosen action would be ""up.""

33,up,"<reasoning>
Let's try to figure out what to do next. The active rule is still ""baba is you,"" which means I can manipulate text blocks if possible. Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key at 1 step up, a door at 2 steps left and 3 steps down, and some walls and other rules scattered around.

First, I need to check if there are any rules that I can change to progress. The goal is usually to reach a ""win"" object, which is currently at 7 steps to the right and 3 steps up. But maybe the definition of ""win"" has been altered? Let's see the active rules: ""baba is you,"" ""is"" is somewhere, ""win"" is as mentioned. No other rules like ""win"" being something else.

Looking at the objects, there's a ""door"" at 2 steps left and 3 steps down. To open a door, usually you need a key. The key is at 1 step up, which is north of my current position. So maybe I should go get the key first. But how do I move there? Let me check my current position relative to the key.

Wait, the key is 1 step up. If I'm facing north, moving up once would get me there. But the observation shows the key's position relative to where? The problem is that the observations describe objects relative to the player's position, but the exact coordinates are a bit unclear. However, based on previous steps, it seems like the player is moving around the grid, and each action changes their position.

In the last observation, after moving up, the key is now 1 step up. So if I move up again, I can reach the key. Once I have the key, I can use it to open the door. The door is at 2 steps left and 3 steps down. So after getting the key, I need to go to the door and use it. But to get to the door, I might have to navigate past some walls. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to change the rules to bypass the door. For example, if I can make ""door"" a ""stop"" or ""lose"" property, but without the key, I can't open it. Wait, the door is a ""stop"" if it's defined that way, but in the current rules, there's no ""door is stop"" or anything. The rule ""stop"" is at 1 step left and 2 step up. So maybe the door is passable unless there's a ""stop"" rule on it. Let me check the active rules again. The active rules are ""baba is you,"" and the other rules are positioned elsewhere on the map. So the door might just be a regular object that I can push or walk through if possible.

But since the player is ""baba"" and ""you,"" maybe I can push objects. However, the door is likely a ""stop"" if there's a rule somewhere. Wait, looking at the objects, there's a ""rule `stop` 1 step to the left and 2 step up."" That rule is separate from the door. So the door's behavior depends on any rules attached to it. Since there's a ""rule `door` 5 steps to the right and 3 steps down,"" but that's a text block, not an active rule. Active rules are the ones in the format ""[Subject] IS [Property]."" So the door's default behavior is probably to be a stop unless changed. But unless there's a rule like ""door is not stop,"" I can't pass through it.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule to make ""door"" something else. For example, ""door is you"" or ""door is win."" But to do that, I need to move the ""is"" text block next to the ""door"" rule and then rearrange them to form a new rule. Let's see where the ""is"" text blocks are located.

In the current observation, there's a rule `is` at 6 steps to the right and 2 step up, another at 1 step to the right and 1 step down, and another at 1 step to the right and 2 steps down. So if I can get to one of these ""is"" blocks and combine it with the ""door"" rule, I can change its property.

The door is at 2 step to the left and 3 steps down. Let's see the positions of the ""is"" blocks relative to the door. The ""is"" at 2 step to the left and 3 steps down is actually the same position as the ""rule `door`"" at 5 steps to the right and 3 steps down. Wait, no, the ""rule `door`"" is at 5 steps to the right and 3 steps down, and the ""is"" is at 2 step to the left and 3 steps down. So the ""door"" rule is to the right of the ""is"" block. If I can move the ""is"" block next to the ""door"" rule, I can create a new rule like ""door is [something].""

But to move the ""is"" block, I need to ensure that it's not defined as ""stop"" or similar. Looking at the objects, the ""is"" blocks are not tagged with any immovable properties. So I can pick them up and move them.

So the plan could be: move to the ""is"" block at 2 step to the left and 3 steps down (which is near the door), combine it with the ""door"" rule to create a new rule, like ""door is win"" or ""door is you."" That way, taking the door would either end the game (if made win) or let me pass through as ""you.""

Alternatively, since I'm already ""you"" (from the active rule ""baba is you,"" but wait, no—the active rules are only ""baba is you."" There's no ""you"" rule assigned to anything else. Wait, looking back at the initial problem description, the active rules are formed by text blocks in the format ""[Subject] IS [Property]."" So ""baba is you"" makes Baba the player. If there's another rule like ""you is win,"" then touching the win object would work. But currently, the only active rule is ""baba is you.""

So to reach the win object at 7 steps to the right and 3 steps up, I need to get there. But there's a wall blocking the path. Let's see the wall positions. There's a wall at 4 steps to the right and 3 steps up, which might be blocking the direct path. So maybe I need to move around the wall, but that might require pushing it if I can. Since I'm ""you"" (as per the active rule), maybe I can push blocks. Wait, pushing blocks usually requires the ""push"" ability, which is not explicitly mentioned here. But in Baba Is You, if you're the subject of a ""push"" rule, you can push. Since there's no such rule here, I can't push.

Alternatively, maybe I can change the wall's property. For example, make it ""push"" or remove the ""wall"" property. But to do that, I need to manipulate the text blocks. The ""rule `wall` 1 step to the left and 2 step up"" is a text block that defines a wall. If I can move that text block away, the wall might disappear. But that text block is at 1 step to the left and 2 step up. To reach it, I might need to navigate through other areas.

This is getting complicated. Let's recap:

- Active rule: baba is you (so I can move and manipulate text blocks).
- Key is at 1 step up. Need to get it to open the door.
- Door is at 2 step left and 3 steps down. It's probably a stop unless changed.
- ""is"" text blocks are present; can combine them with other rules to create new ones.

Possible actions:

1. Move up to get the key.
2. Move to the ""is"" block near the door and combine it with the ""door"" rule to change its property.
3. Navigate around the walls to reach the win object.

But considering the current position after previous moves, the player might be near the key. Let's check the latest observation:

Current Observation shows the key at 1 step up. So moving up once would retrieve the key. Once the key is obtained, the door can be opened. Then move to the door and open it. Alternatively, use the key to open the door from a distance if possible, but in Baba Is You, you usually have to be adjacent to the door to use the key.

After getting the key, moving to the door at 2 step left and 3 steps down. Then, with the key, open the door and proceed to the win object.

But how to move to the door? The path might be blocked by walls. Looking at the walls:

- Wall at 2 steps to the right and 2 step up.
- Wall at 2 steps to the right and 1 step up.
- Wall at 2 steps to the right (base level).
- Wall at 2 steps to the right and 1 step down.
- Wall at 2 steps to the right and 2 steps down.
- Wall at 2 steps to the right and 3 steps down.

So the path south from the key (1 step up) leads into walls. Maybe need to go around them. Alternatively, use the ""is"" blocks to create a new rule that allows passage.

Another approach: Combine the ""is"" block at 6 steps to the right and 2 step up with the ""door"" rule to make ""door"" something else. For example, move the ""is"" block next to the ""door"" rule and form ""door is win."" Then touching the door would make it a win condition.

To do that, I need to move the ""is"" block from 6 steps right and 2 step up to be adjacent to the ""door"" rule at 5 steps right and 3 steps down. That would require moving left and down. But the player's current position isn't clear, but based on previous steps, maybe they are near the ""is"" block at 6 steps right and 2 step up.

Alternatively, the ""is"" block at 1 step right and 2 steps down is closer to the door. Let's see: the ""is"" block is at 1 step right and 2 steps down, and the door is at 2 step left and 3 steps down. So the distance between them is a bit. Maybe moving the ""is"" block to the door's position by pushing or walking.

This is getting a bit too vague without knowing the exact player position. But given the latest observation, the key is 1 step up, and the door is 2 steps left and 3 steps down. The active rules are still ""baba is you,"" so the player can move freely (as Baba) and manipulate text blocks.

The immediate goal seems to be getting the key. So moving up once to pick up the key. Once the key is obtained, the door can be opened. Then proceed to the door's location and open it. After that, the path to the win object at 7 steps right and 3 steps up might be clear.

Alternatively, if the door is made into a win condition, touching it would end the game. So creating ""door is win"" would be ideal. To do that, need to move the ""is"" block next to the ""door"" rule.

In the current observation, there's a ""rule `is`"" at 1 step to the right and 2 steps down. The ""door"" rule is at 5 steps to the right and 3 steps down. So the ""is"" block is not adjacent to the door. To get them adjacent, the player would need to move the ""is"" block south or east.

But moving the ""is"" block requires moving it over the grid. If the player is near that ""is"" block, they can pick it up and move it. For example, moving down from the current position to reach the ""is"" block at 1 step right and 2 steps down, then moving southeast to place it next to the ""door"" rule.

This seems complex, but perhaps the quickest way is to get the key and open the door. So the next action should be moving up to retrieve the key.

Let's try to figure out the next move here. The active rule is still ""baba is you,"" which means I can move around and potentially push things since I'm Baba. Looking at the objects on the map, there's a door that's a ""win"" if I can reach it, but right now the rules say ""win"" is a separate object. The key is in the map, but I don't know if it's needed yet.

First, I need to check where the door is. The observation shows a door at 2 steps to the left and 4 steps down. But there are walls around, so I might need to navigate around them. Also, there's a rule ""door"" at 5 steps to the right and 5 steps down, which probably means the door's default property is something else, but since the active rule is ""baba is you,"" maybe I can override that.

Wait, the current active rules are just ""baba is you."" All the other rules like ""win"" and ""door"" are defined as text blocks, but they aren't active unless they're in the active rules. So to get to the door, I need to either move it or change the rule so that ""baba"" is ""win"" or the door becomes a ""win.""

Looking at the objects, there's a ""key"" at 6 steps to the right and 3 steps down. Maybe picking up the key allows me to do something, like unlock a rule or a door. But how do I pick up the key? Since I'm Baba and ""baba is you,"" I can move onto the key. Once I'm on the key, does that give me the key? In Baba Is You, picking up a key usually requires stepping on it, and then you can use it to open a door. But in this case, the key's position is fixed unless I can move it by rearranging the text blocks.

Wait, the rules are formed by text blocks. For example, there's a rule `win` at 5 steps to the right and 3 step up. If I can move that `win` text block next to the door, then the door would become the win condition. But to do that, I need to move the `win` rule. However, can I move the `win` rule? The rule says ""baba is you,"" which means I can move objects that aren't defined as ""stop"" or similar. The `win` rule itself is a text block, so if it's not marked as stop, I can move it. Looking at the objects, the ""stop"" rule is at 1 step to the left and 2 step up. So other text blocks like `is`, `win`, `wall`, etc., can be moved unless they're under a stop rule.

So the plan might be: move the `win` text block next to the door so that the door becomes the win condition. To do that, I need to navigate to where the `win` rule is located. The `win` rule is at 5 steps to the right and 3 step up. Currently, I'm at the position of Baba, which is at 2 steps to the right and 1 step up (from the last observation). Wait, in the current observation, Baba's position is implied by the rules. Let me check again.

In the latest observation, the active rules are ""baba is you."" The objects list includes ""rule `baba` 3 step to the left and 5 steps down."" Wait, no—the `baba` text block is a rule, not Baba's position. So where is Baba actually located? In Baba Is You, Baba's position is separate from the text blocks. The text blocks define the rules, but Baba's position is on the map as an object. Looking at the objects list, I don't see Baba explicitly mentioned except in the rules. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Maybe Baba is represented by the ""baba"" text block's position? Or perhaps the player's position is inferred based on previous moves.

Wait, in the previous observations, after moving right, left, up, etc., the map's configuration changes. But the current observation lists all objects, including walls, rules, key, door, etc., but not Baba. That's odd. Maybe Baba is represented by the ""rule `baba`"" object? For example, in the current observation, there's a ""rule `baba`"" at 3 step to the left and 5 steps down. If that's the case, then my current position is there. But I need to confirm.

Alternatively, perhaps the player's position is not listed explicitly, and I have to deduce it based on the movement actions taken. Since the previous actions were moving right, left, up, down, the player's position would change accordingly. But given that the observations are getting more complex with each step, it's challenging to track without seeing Baba's direct position.

Assuming that the ""rule `baba`"" objects are placeholders for where Baba can move, perhaps I need to move that rule to a different position. For example, to reach the door, I might need to move the `win` rule next to it. Let me look at the current positions of key and door again.

The key is at 6 steps to the right and 3 steps down. The door is at 2 step to the left and 4 steps down. There's a ""rule `door`"" at 5 steps to the right and 5 steps down, which might be a static rule defining the door's behavior. But the active rule is still ""baba is you,"" so unless I change that, the door's default property is whatever the rule says. Since the `win` rule is currently at 5 steps to the right and 3 step up, I need to move that `win` rule to the door's location.

To move the `win` rule, I have to go to its current position (5 steps to the right and 3 step up) and then move it. But wait, in the current observation, the `win` rule is at 5 steps to the right and 1 step up. No, looking back: in the previous observation before the last ""up"" move, the `win` rule was at 5 steps to the right and 3 step up. Then after moving up, it shifted to 5 steps to the right and 4 step up. Now, in the latest observation, after moving up again, the `win` rule is at 5 steps to the right and 2 step up.

Wait, the exact positions are a bit confusing. Let me parse the latest observation:

Current Observation:
Active rules:
baba is you

Objects on the map:
wall 2 steps to the right and 1 step up
rule `is` 6 steps to the right and 1 step up
rule `win` 7 steps to the right and 1 step up
rule `wall` 3 step to the left
rule `stop` 1 step to the left
wall 2 steps to the right
wall 2 steps to the right and 1 step down
wall 2 steps to the right and 2 steps down
rule `is` 1 step to the right and 3 steps down
wall 2 steps to the right and 3 steps down
rule `key` 6 steps to the right and 3 steps down
door 2 step to the left and 4 steps down
wall 2 steps to the right and 4 steps down
rule `baba` 3 step to the left and 5 steps down
rule `is` 2 step to the left and 5 steps down
rule `you` 1 step to the left and 5 steps down
wall 2 steps to the right and 5 steps down
rule `door` 5 steps to the right and 5 steps down

So, the `win` rule is now at 7 steps to the right and 1 step up. The door is at 2 steps to the left and 4 steps down. The `rule `door`` is at 5 steps to the right and 5 steps down. To make the door a win, I need to have a rule that says ""door is win"" or ""win is door."" Currently, the active rule is only ""baba is you.""

Alternatively, I can create a new rule by combining existing text blocks. For example, if I can move the `win` rule next to the door's position, then ""door is win"" would be the rule, making the door the win condition. But the `win` rule is currently far away at 7 steps to the right and 1 step up.

To move the `win` rule, I need to navigate to its location. My current position is likely near the `baba` rule at 3 step to the left and 5 steps down. From there, moving up might get me closer to the `win` rule. Let's see:

If I'm at 3 step to the left and 5 steps down (rule `baba`'s position), moving up once would take me to 3 step left and 4 steps down. Then up again to 3 left and 3 down, and so on. But the `win` rule is at 7 right and 1 up. That's quite far. Maybe there's a more efficient path.

Alternatively, perhaps I should first reach the `win` rule at 7 right and 1 up. To get there from my current position (assuming I'm at 3 left, 5 down), I need to move right multiple times and up. But there are walls in the way. For example, there's a wall at 2 steps to the right and 1 step up. So moving right from 3 left to 2 left would hit a wall. Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Wait, maybe the key is needed first. The key is at 6 steps to the right and 3 steps down. If I can move to the key, pick it up, and then use it to unlock a door or move a rule. But how does the key work in this context? In Baba Is You, you usually pick up the key by stepping on it, then use it on a locked door. But here, there's no locked door mentioned. The door is just a door; unless there's a ""locked"" rule, it can be passed through. But the door's default property is whatever the `rule `door`` says. Looking at the `rule `door`` at 5 steps to the right and 5 steps down, it's a static rule, so the door's behavior is defined by that. Since the active rule is ""baba is you,"" and there's no overriding rule for the door, maybe the door is just a regular object that can be pushed or moved if possible.

Alternatively, maybe the door is a stop object. But the `stop` rule is at 1 step to the left and 1 step up, so it doesn't affect the door. So perhaps the door can be moved if I push it, since I'm Baba (you). But I need to be adjacent to it and push it in the desired direction. The door is at 2 step to the left and 4 steps down. If I can get next to it and push it, maybe I can move it into a position where a rule applies. But without a ""win"" rule next to it, it won't matter.

Alternatively, maybe I should create a new rule by combining `baba`, `is`, and `win` into a single text block. For example, if I can move the `is` rule next to `baba` and `win`, that would create ""baba is win,"" making Baba the win condition. That's a common solution in Baba Is You puzzles. So, if I can rearrange the text blocks to form ""baba is win,"" then touching Baba would make me win.

To do that, I need to move the `win` rule next to the `baba` rule and the `is` rule. The `baba` rule is at 3 step to the left and 5 steps down. The `is` rule is at 6 steps to the right and 1 step up. The `win` rule is at 7 steps to the right and 1 step up. So, perhaps I can move the `is` rule down to be near the `baba` rule, and then move the `win` rule to be next to the `is` rule.

But how to move these rules? Since I'm Baba, and the rules aren't stopped, I can move them by stepping on them and pushing them. For example, to move the `is` rule from 6 right, 1 up to a position next to `baba` at 3 left, 5 down, I'd need to navigate there, but there are walls blocking the path. The wall at 2 steps to the right and 1 step up might be in the way.

This is getting really complex. Maybe the best approach is to first reach the `win` rule and move it towards the door or combine it with other rules. Alternatively, create the ""baba is win"" rule by arranging the existing text blocks.

Another angle: the `rule `you`` is at 1 step to the left and 3 steps down. If I can move that `you` rule next to `baba`, then ""baba is you"" would still be active, but maybe combining it with `win` could help. Not sure.

Wait, the current active rule is ""baba is you."" So I am Baba. If I can create a rule that says ""baba is win,"" then touching Baba (myself) would make me win. To create that rule, I need the text blocks ""baba"", ""is"", and ""win"" arranged in sequence. The existing `baba` rule is at 3 left, 5 down. The `is` rule is at 6 right, 1 up. The `win` rule is at 7 right, 1 up. So the `is` and `win` are already adjacent horizontally. If I can move the `baba` rule next to them, then they would form ""baba is win.""

But how to move the `baba` rule? It's a text block, so I can push it if it's not stopped. The `rule `baba`` is at 3 left, 5 down. There's a wall at 2 steps to the right and 1 step up, but that's above. To move the `baba` rule, I need to be adjacent to it and push it. If I'm at 3 left, 5 down (the position of the `baba` rule), I can push it in any direction, but there might be walls blocking. Looking at the objects, there's a wall at 2 steps to the right and 1 step up, but that's not in the same row as the `baba` rule.

Assuming I can move the `baba` rule, say to the right, then it would be at 2 left, 5 down. Then, if the `is` and `win` rules are at 6 right, 1 up and 7 right, 1 up, they are far away. This seems unlikely to work.

Alternatively, maybe I should focus on moving the `win` rule closer. The `win` rule is at 7 right, 1 up. If I can move it down and to the left, perhaps near the door. But to do that, I need to navigate to its location, which is quite far from my current position.

Given the complexity, perhaps the quickest way is to move towards the `win` rule and rearrange the text blocks. But given the time constraints and the previous failed actions, maybe the correct next move is to move down towards the door or up to reach the text blocks.

Alternatively, since the `key` is at 6 right and 3 down, maybe picking it up will allow me to move a rule. But in Baba Is You, the key doesn't inherently do anything unless there's a locked door. Since there's no locked door here, maybe the key is a red herring, or its purpose is to allow moving a rule that's behind it.

Looking at the map, the key is at 6 right, 3 down. To reach it, I need to move right from my current position (assuming I'm near the `baba` rule at 3 left, 5 down). Moving right twice would get me to 1 left, 5 down. Then down to 1 left, 6 down? Wait, the movement is in steps, so each action moves one step in a direction.

This is getting too confusing without a visual map. But based on the latest observation, the most logical step might be to move down towards the door or towards the `win` rule. Alternatively, try to move the `is` rule next to `baba` and `win`.

Considering the previous actions and the pattern of moving right, left, up, down, perhaps the solver is oscillating without making progress. Maybe the correct action now is to move down towards the door to see if it can be pushed or if a rule can be applied there.

Alternatively, since the `rule `door`` is at 5 right, 5 down, and the door is at 2 left, 4 down, maybe combining the `door` rule with the `win` rule would make the door the win condition. But how?

Another approach: since the active rule is ""baba is you,"" and I need to reach the door, which is a `door` object. Unless there's a rule that makes `door` a `win`, I can't win by reaching it. So the solution must involve creating a ""door is win"" rule or a ""baba is win"" rule.

To create ""door is win,"" I need the text blocks `door`, `is`, and `win` arranged together. The `door` rule is at 5 right, 5 down. The `is` rule is at 6 right, 1 up. The `win` rule is at 7 right, 1 up. These are all separated. It's difficult to move them together.

Alternatively, create ""baba is win"" by moving the `win` rule next to `baba` and `is`. The `baba` rule is at 3 left, 5 down. The `is` rule is at 6 right, 1 up. The `win` rule is at 7 right, 1 up. To get them together, I need to move the `is` rule down and to the left, and the `win` rule left as well. But there are walls in the way, like the wall at 2 right, 1 up.

Maybe the key here is to move the `is` rule down to be near the `baba` rule. The `is` rule is at 6 right, 1 up. If I can push it down to, say, 6 right, 2 down, then maybe place the `win` rule next to it. But how?

This requires navigating to the `is` rule's position and pushing it","

Let's try to figure out what to do here. The active rule is still ""Baba is you,"" so I can move Baba around. The goal is to reach the Win object, but right now it's a door probably because of some rule like ""door is win"" or something. Looking at the objects, the key is at 6 steps right and 3 steps down. The door is at 2 steps left and 4 steps down. There's also a rule 'baba' somewhere to the left, maybe at 3 steps left and 5 steps down.

Wait, the rules at the bottom say ""rule `baba` 3 step to the left and 5 steps down,"" so that must be a text block. Similarly, there's an 'is' and 'you' rule next to it. So maybe that's where I can manipulate the rules. The current active rule is ""baba is you,"" so I can push or move that text block to make new rules. 

If I can get to the 'baba' text block and combine it with 'is' and 'you' to make ""baba is you"" again, maybe that's redundant, but perhaps there's another rule that can change the win condition. The door is a win if the rule says so. There's a 'door' rule at 5 steps right and 5 steps down, which might be ""door is stop"" or something else. I need to check the existing rules. 

Looking at the objects, the 'is' rules are at various positions. Maybe if I can move the 'baba' text block next to an 'is' and a different property, like 'win,' I can create ""baba is win,"" making Baba himself the win condition. That way, standing on Baba would make him the win. 

But first, I need to navigate to those text blocks. The 'baba' rule is at 3 steps left and 5 steps down. To get there, from my current position (which I assume is the starting point, maybe near the original Baba), I need to move left and down. But there are walls blocking the path. Let's see the map layout. 

Current position: Not specified, but based on the objects, Baba is probably at the origin, and the walls are around. The key is at 6 right, 3 down. The 'baba' rule is 3 left and 5 down. The 'is' rule is at 2 left and 5 down, and 'you' is at 1 left and 5 down. So those three text blocks are clustered to the left and down. 

To reach the 'baba' text block, I need to move left and down, but there are walls. For example, rule `stop` is 1 step left and 1 step up. So moving left directly might hit a stop wall. Maybe I need to find a path around. Alternatively, use the key to open a door, but the door is at 2 left and 4 down, which is a door. If I can make the door not a stop, maybe by changing its property. 

Wait, the active rules are still ""baba is you,"" so I can move any text blocks that aren't labeled 'stop' or similar. So 'is', 'win', 'wall', 'key', 'door' might be movable. The 'stop' rule at 1 left, 1 up is immovable. 

So the plan is: first, get the key located at 6 right, 3 down. But to get there, I might have to move right and down. However, there's a wall at 2 right and 1 up, which could block the path. Alternatively, maybe move down through the lower paths. 

Alternatively, target the text blocks to the left. Let's see. The 'baba' rule is 3 left and 5 down. To get there from the current position (assuming starting at 0,0), I need to move left 3 and down 5, but there are walls in the way. For example, at 2 left, 5 down, there's a wall. So perhaps I need to navigate around. 

Alternatively, maybe combine existing rules. If I can move the 'baba' text block next to an 'is' and a 'win' rule, that would create ""baba is win,"" making Baba the win condition. So the steps would be: move to the 'baba' rule at 3 left, 5 down, then move the 'is' rule from 2 left, 5 down next to it, and then the 'win' rule from 7 right, 3 up (but that's far away). Alternatively, maybe there's a 'win' rule somewhere else. Wait, the active rules are ""baba is you,"" and the objects include a 'win' rule at 7 right, 3 up. That's quite far. 

Alternatively, maybe use the 'key' to unlock something. The key is at 6 right, 3 down. If I can get the key and bring it to the door, but the door is at 2 left, 4 down. But moving the key might be possible since it's not a stop. So perhaps: move right to get the key, then move left to the door. But there's a wall at 2 right, 1 up, so maybe navigating down. 

Alternatively, focus on changing the rules. The key is at 6 right, 3 down. If I can move the 'key' to somewhere else, but not sure. Let's think again. The main goal is to reach the win condition. The current active rule is ""baba is you,"" so if I can make ""baba is win,"" then touching Baba would win. 

To create ""baba is win,"" I need the 'baba' text block, the 'is' text block, and the 'win' text block adjacent. The 'baba' is at 3 left,5 down. The 'is' is at 2 left,5 down. The 'win' is at 7 right,3 up. That's quite far. Maybe it's better to move the 'win' text block closer. But how? 

Alternatively, use existing 'is' rules. There's an 'is' at 1 step right and 1 step down, and another at 2 left,5 down. Maybe move the 'win' rule to be next to 'baba' and 'is'. But the 'win' is at 7 right,3 up. That's a long way. 

Alternatively, look for other rules. The 'door' rule is at 5 right,3 down. If I can change 'door' to 'win', that would make the door the win condition. To do that, I need to create ""door is win"" by moving the 'door' text block next to 'is' and 'win'. The 'door' is at 5 right,3 down. The 'is' is at 6 right,3 up (wait, no: looking back, the 'is' rule is at 6 steps right and 3 step up in the first observation, but later positions change as the player moves. Wait, the current observation's 'is' rule is at 6 steps right and 1 step up. Hmm, the positions are changing as the player moves, so the exact positions depend on where the player has moved the text blocks. 

This is getting complicated. Let me try to outline the current state based on the last Observation:

Active rules: baba is you

Objects:
- wall 2 right,1 up
- rule `is` 6 right,1 up
- rule `win`7 right,1 up
- rule `wall`3 left
- rule `stop`1 left
- wall 2 right
- wall 2 right,1 down
- wall 2 right,2 down
- rule `is`1 right,3 down
- wall 2 right,3 down
- rule `key`6 right,3 down
- door2 left,4 down
- wall2 right,4 down
- rule `baba`3 left,5 down
- rule `is`2 left,5 down
- rule `you`1 left,5 down
- wall2 right,5 down
- rule `door`5 right,5 down

So the key is at 6 right,3 down. The 'baba' rule is at 3 left,5 down. The 'is' rules are at 2 left,5 down and 1 right,3 down. The 'you' rule is at 1 left,5 down. The 'door' rules are at 5 right,5 down and 2 left,4 down.

To make ""baba is win"", I need to bring the 'baba' text block next to an 'is' and a 'win' text block. The 'win' is currently at 7 right,1 up, which is far to the right and up. Maybe moving the 'win' rule closer. But how?

Alternatively, use the existing 'is' at 2 left,5 down. If I can move the 'baba' rule (3 left,5 down) next to that 'is' and the 'win' rule. But the 'win' is at 7 right,1 up. That's a long way. Maybe instead, use the 'win' rule that's part of the active rules? No, the active rule is ""baba is you"", but other 'win' rules are objects on the map.

Alternatively, create a new rule ""door is win"" by moving the 'door' text block (5 right,5 down) next to 'is' (2 left,5 down) and 'win' (7 right,1 up). That seems difficult. 

Another angle: Since the player is ""Baba"", and the goal is usually to reach the 'win' which is likely the door, maybe the door is behind a 'stop' wall. The 'stop' rule is at 1 left,1 up. So to get past that, perhaps change the 'stop' property. For example, move the 'stop' rule away or change it to something else. But 'stop' is a property, so maybe the rule is ""wall is stop"". If I can move that rule to make ""wall is not stop"", then the wall becomes movable. 

The rule ""rule `stop` 1 step to the left and 2 step up"" – wait, in the current observation, the 'stop' rule is at 1 left,1 up. The 'wall' rule is at 3 left. So the 'wall is stop' rule is probably at 3 left,2 up or somewhere. Wait, the objects include ""rule `wall` 5 step to the left and 2 step up"" in some previous observations, but in the latest, it's ""rule `wall` 3 step to the left"". Hmm.

Alternatively, focus on the key. Get the key located at 6 right,3 down. To reach there, move right 6 and down 3, but there are walls. From the current position (assuming starting at 0,0), moving right 2 steps would hit a wall at 2 right,1 up. So perhaps move down first. Let's say I'm at (0,0). Moving down to (0,-1), then right to (2,-1), but there's a wall at 2 right,1 up, which is at (2,1) in the initial position, but now positions might have changed as the player moves. This is getting confusing without knowing the exact starting point.

Alternatively, think about the fact that the 'key' is at 6 right,3 down. If I can move towards that, but navigating through the map. However, there are walls blocking. Maybe the path is blocked by walls, so I need to use the 'is' rules to change properties. 

Wait, the 'is' rule at 6 right,1 up. If I can move that 'is' rule next to the 'key' and another rule to create a new rule. For example, ""key is win"" would make the key the win condition. But the key is at 6 right,3 down. The 'is' is at 6 right,1 up. So maybe move the 'is' rule down to be near the key. But can I move the 'is' rule? Yes, since it's not labeled 'stop'. 

So the steps could be: move down from the 'is' at 6 right,1 up to 6 right,2 down, then to 6 right,3 down where the key is. But there's a wall at 2 right,2 down. So maybe that's not possible. 

Alternatively, move the 'key' to a different position. But the key is an object, not a rule, so maybe it can be moved if it's not 'stop'. The key's position is at 6 right,3 down. If I can move it left to where the 'door' is at 2 left,4 down, but that's a long way. 

This is really tricky. Let me try to summarize:

Current active rule: Baba is you.

Win condition is likely a door, but it's guarded by a 'stop' wall or rule. To pass the stop, need to change the rule. For example, if ""wall is stop"", changing it to ""wall is not stop"" would let us move through. The 'wall is stop' rule is probably a text block somewhere. Looking at the objects, there's a ""rule `wall` 3 step to the left"" which might be ""wall is [something]"". If that's ""wall is stop"", then moving that rule to make it ""wall is you"" or something else. 

In the current observation, the 'wall' rule is at 3 left. So the text block says ""wall is [property]"", and it's located at 3 left. If I can move that 'wall' rule to be next to an 'is' and a different property, like 'push' or 'win', then the wall's property changes. 

For example, if the 'wall' rule is at 3 left, and I can move it next to 'is' and 'push', then it becomes ""wall is push"", making walls movable. Then I can move through them. 

So the plan: move to the 'wall' rule at 3 left, bring an 'is' rule next to it, and a 'push' rule (if available) to change its property. But where is the 'push' rule? Not sure if it exists. Alternatively, use 'you' or another property. 

Alternatively, target the 'stop' rule at 1 left,1 up. If I can move that 'stop' rule away or change its property. 

This is really complicated. Maybe the simplest way is to create ""baba is win"" by moving the 'baba' text block next to 'is' and 'win'. The 'baba' is at 3 left,5 down. The 'is' is at 2 left,5 down. The 'win' is at7 right,1 up. That's a far distance, but perhaps possible by moving the 'win' rule left. 

But how to move the 'win' rule? It's a text block, so if it's not 'stop', I can move it. The 'win' rule is at7 right,1 up. To move it left, need to navigate around. 

Alternatively, use the existing 'is' at 1 right,3 down. If I can move the 'baba' rule (3 left,5 down) to be next to that 'is' and the 'win' rule. But the distance is too great. 

Maybe the key is a distraction. The main thing is to reach the win condition. Since the player is Baba, if we can make Baba the win, then standing on him would work. So create ""baba is win"" by adjacent text blocks. 

To do that, need 'baba', 'is', and 'win' next to each other. The 'baba' is at3 left,5 down. The 'is' is at2 left,5 down. The 'win' is at7 right,1 up. Perhaps move the 'win' rule leftward. But how? 

Alternatively, there's a 'door' rule at5 right,5 down. If we make ""door is win"", then touching the door would win. To do that, move 'door' next to 'is' and 'win'. The 'door' is at5 right,5 down. The 'is' is at2 left,5 down. The 'win' is at7 right,1 up. Not sure. 

This is getting too time-consuming. Maybe the best action is to move towards the 'baba' text block at3 left,5 down, to try to manipulate the rules there. So from the current position, which is unclear, but assuming near the center, move left and down. But there are walls. For example, at2 left,5 down there's a wall. So maybe move around that. 

Alternatively, move down to reach the 'is' rule at1 right,3 down, then move left to get to the 'baba' rule. 

Alternatively, grab the 'key' first. Move right to6 right,3 down, but there's a wall at2 right,1 up. Maybe move down to avoid walls. 

This is really challenging without knowing the exact layout. Based on the latest observation, the key is at6 right,3 down. The 'baba' rule is at3 left,5 down. The 'is' rules are at2 left,5 down and1 right,3 down. 

Perhaps the best action is to move left towards the 'baba' rule. So the action would be ""left"".

Let's take a look at the current situation in Baba Is You. The active rule is still ""baba is you"", which means I can manipulate other rules by moving them around. The goal is usually to reach a ""win"" object, but sometimes that changes. Let me check the objects on the map.

First, I need to see where all the elements are positioned. There's a key somewhere. Let me scan the objects:

- There's a key at 1 step to the right.
- A door at 1 step to the left and 4 steps down.
- The ""win"" rule is at 8 steps to the right and 1 step up. But right now, the rule is ""win"", so touching that would make me win. However, there are walls blocking the path. Let's see the layout.

Looking at the walls:
- There's a wall at 3 steps to the right and 1 step up. Then rule `is` at 7 steps right and 1 up, followed by `win` at 8 right, 1 up. So the path to the `win` rule is blocked by walls and other rules.

I need to figure out how to reach the `win` rule. Since ""baba is you"", I can push or move text blocks that aren't marked as ""stop"". The ""stop"" rule is at 1 step left, so anything with ""stop"" property can't be moved. 

The key is at 1 step to the right. Maybe I need to get the key first to unlock a door? The door is at 1 step left and 4 steps down. But I'm not sure if the key is necessary here. Alternatively, perhaps rearranging the rules to change the ""win"" condition or make a path clear.

Looking at the rules:
- ""baba is you"" is active, so I can move other rules.
- The ""win"" is a rule at 8 right, 1 up. To reach it, I need to move through the walls. But walls are there, so maybe I need to change the ""wall"" rule to something else. The ""wall"" rule is at 2 steps left. If I can change that, maybe I can remove the walls blocking the path.

Alternatively, maybe create a new rule that allows me to pass through walls. For example, making ""wall is stop"" would make walls immovable, but if I can change that to ""wall is"", then walls would be movable. Wait, but the current rules are:

- rule `wall` 2 step to the left: This is the ""wall is"" rule? Wait, no. The rules are in the format ""[Subject] IS [Property]"". So ""rule `wall` 2 step to the left"" probably means the text block ""wall is"" is located there. Similarly, ""rule `stop` 1 step to the left"" is the ""stop is"" text block.

So current rules:

- At 2 step left: ""wall is"" (since it's rule `wall`)
- At 1 step left: ""stop is"" (rule `stop`)
- At 3 right, 1 up: wall (object)
- At 7 right, 1 up: rule `is` (which is the text ""is""?) Wait, no. The rule `is` would mean the text block ""is is""? That doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the notation.

Wait, the observation lists objects and rules. The ""rule `is`"" entries are the text blocks that define the rules. For example, ""rule `is` X Y"" means there's a text block on the map at position X Y that says ""is"". Similarly, ""rule `win` ..."" is a text block saying ""win is"". Wait, no—the rules are formed by text blocks in the format ""[Subject] IS [Property]"". So each rule is a text block composed of three parts: Subject, ""IS"", Property. So if there's a text block ""BABA IS YOU"", that's three connected objects: baba, is, you.

But in the observation, the ""rule `is`"" entries might be parts of these rules. Wait, perhaps the game represents each rule as three separate text blocks. For example, the rule ""BABA IS YOU"" would be three text blocks: baba, is, you placed next to each other. But in the observation, the user lists objects and rules. The ""rule `X`"" entries are probably the individual components. Hmm, this might be confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the ""rule `X`"" entries represent the entire rule text blocks. For instance, a rule located at position A that says ""BABA IS YOU"" would be listed as a rule `baba` at position A, followed by rule `is` at the next position, then rule `you` at the next. But the way the observation is presented here seems to list each rule component as a separate object. For example, ""rule `is` 5 steps to the right and 3 step up"" could be the ""IS"" part of a rule.

This is a bit unclear. Let me try to parse the observation again.

Current Observation:

Active rules:
baba is you

Objects on the map:
wall 3 steps to the right and 1 step up
rule `is` 7 steps to the right and 1 step up
rule `win` 8 steps to the right and 1 step up
rule `wall` 2 step to the left
rule `stop` 1 step to the left
key 1 step to the right
wall 3 steps to the right
wall 3 steps to the right and 1 step down
wall 3 steps to the right and 2 steps down
rule `is` 2 steps to the right and 3 steps down
wall 3 steps to the right and 3 steps down
rule `key` 7 steps to the right and 3 steps down
door 1 step to the left and 4 steps down
wall 3 steps to the right and 4 steps down
rule `baba` 2 step to the left and 5 steps down
rule `is` 1 step to the left and 5 steps down
rule `you` 5 steps down
wall 3 steps to the right and 5 steps down
rule `door` 6 steps to the right and 5 steps down

So the active rule is ""baba is you"", meaning I can manipulate other rules by moving their text blocks.

The ""win"" is a rule at 8 right, 1 up. To reach that, I need to get past the walls. The walls are at 3 right, 1 up; 3 right; 3 right, 1 down; etc. But how to move through them?

The ""wall"" rule is at 2 step to the left. That's probably the text block ""wall is"" somewhere. If I can change that rule, maybe to ""wall is push"" or something, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, if I can make the walls not act as walls by redefining them.

But since I'm Baba and can push rules, I need to see if I can move the ""wall"" rule text block. The ""rule `wall` 2 step to the left"" is a text block that defines that ""wall"" has the property... Wait, no. The ""rule `wall`"" would be part of a rule. For example, a rule like ""WALL IS STOP"" would have three parts: wall, is, stop. So if the game represents each rule as three separate text blocks connected together, then the ""rule `wall`"" at 2 step left is the ""WALL"" part of a rule. Similarly, ""rule `is`"" is the ""IS"" part, and ""rule `stop`"" is the ""STOP"" part.

In the current observation, there's a ""rule `wall`"" at 2 step left, a ""rule `stop`"" at 1 step left, and other ""rule `is`"", ""rule `win`"", etc. So perhaps the active rules are formed by combining these parts. For example, the ""baba is you"" rule is made up of the text blocks ""baba"", ""is"", ""you"" connected together somewhere. But in the current observation, I don't see the ""you"" part of that rule except in the 5 steps down position: ""rule `you` 5 steps down"". Wait, that's part of another rule, like ""X IS YOU"".

But the active rule listed is ""baba is you"", which means that somewhere on the map, the text blocks ""baba"", ""is"", ""you"" are connected to form that rule. The other rules like ""wall is stop"" would be formed by their respective text blocks.

So, to manipulate the rules, I need to find the text blocks that make up the current rules and rearrange them. For example, if I can take the ""is"" from the ""baba is you"" rule and attach it to ""wall"" and ""stop"", I could change ""wall is stop"" to ""wall is something else"".

Looking at the map, there's a ""rule `is`"" at 7 steps right and 1 step up, next to the ""rule `win`"" at 8 steps right, 1 up. So perhaps the ""win"" rule is ""something IS win"", but the subject is missing. Wait, no. The ""win"" rule is probably ""WIN IS ..."" but the active rule listed is ""baba is you"", so maybe the ""win"" rule is ""WIN IS WIN"", making touching it a win. But I need to confirm.

Alternatively, the ""win"" rule could be part of a rule like ""YOU IS WIN"", which would make touching you (Baba) a win. Since the active rule is ""baba is you"", if there's a ""you is win"" rule, then touching Baba (since you) would make you win. But looking at the objects, there's a ""rule `you` 5 steps down"" and a ""rule `door` 6 steps right, 5 steps down"". Not sure.

Alternatively, the ""win"" rule at 8 right, 1 up is a standalone rule, and touching it directly would win. But the path is blocked by walls and other rules.

So, to reach the ""win"" rule, I need to clear the path. The walls are likely defined by the ""wall is stop"" rule. The ""rule `wall` 2 step left"" and ""rule `stop` 1 step left"" are parts of that rule. If I can move those text blocks to change the definition of ""wall"", maybe to ""wall is push"" or remove the ""stop"" property.

But how to do that? Since I'm Baba, and the active rule is ""baba is you"", I can push other rules. The ""rule `wall`"" at 2 left and ""rule `stop`"" at 1 left are part of the ""wall is stop"" rule. If I can move the ""stop"" rule to a different position, I can redefine what ""wall"" does.

For example, if I move the ""rule `stop`"" from 1 left to somewhere else, then the ""wall is"" rule would no longer have a ""stop"" property, making walls passable. Alternatively, I could create a new rule like ""wall is push"" so that walls can be pushed out of the way.

But to do that, I need to find the ""is"" text blocks that are part of the existing rules. Looking at the map, there's a ""rule `is`"" at 7 right, 1 up (near the ""win"" rule), another at 2 right, 3 down, and others. The ""is"" text blocks are critical because they connect subjects and properties.

Another approach: Since the door is at 1 left, 4 down, and there's a key at 1 right, maybe I need to get the key to unlock the door. But how? The door's rule is at 6 right, 5 down: ""rule `door` 6 steps to the right and 5 steps down"". If the door is normally a stop, but if I can change the door's rule to something else, like ""door is key"", then stepping on the door with the key might open it. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, if I can make the door a ""win"" instead of a stop, then stepping on it would win. To do that, I need to redefine the door's rule. The current ""door"" rule is probably ""door is stop"" or similar. If I can replace ""stop"" with ""win"", that would work.

But to do any of this, I need to move the text blocks. Let's see where the ""is"" text blocks are. There's a ""rule `is`"" at 7 right, 1 up (near the win rule), another at 2 right, 3 down, and one at 1 left, 5 down (part of the ""you is"" rule?).

Maybe the key is at 1 right, and if I can reach it, I can carry it to the door. But the path to the key is clear? Let's check:

Looking at the objects:

- Key is at 1 step to the right.
- Walls at 3 right, 1 up; 3 right; 3 right, 1 down; etc.
- So from Baba's current position (assuming start position isn't specified, but based on the rules' positions, maybe I'm near the left side?), moving right to get the key might be possible if there's a path.

Wait, the initial position of Baba isn't specified here, but looking at the rules, the ""baba"" rule is at 3 left, 5 steps down: ""rule `baba` 3 step to the left and 5 steps down"". So Baba is likely at that position, which is 3 left, 5 down. The ""you"" rule is at 1 left, 5 down, so maybe that's part of another rule.

From Baba's position (3 left, 5 down), to get to the key at 1 right, I need to move right. But there are walls at 3 right, 1 up, etc. Wait, the walls are spread out. Let me try to visualize the map.

Alternatively, maybe the best approach is to change the ""wall is stop"" rule to something else. The ""rule `wall`"" is at 2 left, and ""rule `stop`"" at 1 left. If I can move the ""stop"" rule away, then the wall rule would be ""wall is [nothing]"", making walls passable. To do that, I need to push the ""stop"" rule text block somewhere else.

But can I move the ""stop"" rule? Since ""baba is you"", and the ""stop"" rule is a text block, unless it's protected by another rule, I should be able to move it. The ""stop"" property makes objects immovable, but the text blocks themselves can be moved unless they're part of a ""stop"" rule.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is a text block that defines that something is stop. For example, ""WALL IS STOP"" makes walls stop. If I can remove the ""STOP"" part of that rule, then walls won't be stop anymore.

So the ""rule `stop` 1 step to the left"" is the ""STOP"" part of the ""wall is stop"" rule. If I can move that ""stop"" rule to a different position, the wall rule would no longer have the stop property.

To move the ""stop"" rule, I need to be adjacent to it and push it. The ""stop"" rule is at 1 step to the left. If I'm at 3 left, 5 down (Baba's position), moving left to 1 left would get to the ""stop"" rule. But is there a wall in the way?

Looking at the objects, there's a wall at 2 step left (rule `wall` at 2 left) and another wall at 1 left (rule `stop`). So from Baba's position (3 left, 5 down), moving left twice would reach the ""stop"" rule at 1 left. But there's a wall at 2 left (rule `wall`), which is a text block, not an object wall. Wait, the walls mentioned are separate objects. For example, ""wall 3 steps to the right and 1 step up"" is an actual wall object, blocking movement.

So the text blocks like ""rule `wall`"" and ""rule `stop`"" are separate from the wall objects. So moving the ""rule `stop`"" text block at 1 left should be possible if I can reach it without hitting a wall object.

Assuming Baba is at 3 left, 5 down, to get to the ""stop"" rule at 1 left, he needs to move left twice. But is there a wall in between? The objects listed are walls at specific positions, like 3 right, 1 up, etc. So moving left from 3 left to 2 left to 1 left should be possible if there are no wall objects in between. The wall objects are at 3 right, various positions down, but not on the left side near Baba's position.

Therefore, the plan is:

1. Move left from Baba's position (3 left, 5 down) to reach the ""stop"" rule at 1 left.
2. Push the ""stop"" rule to a different position, say, one step down, to break the ""wall is stop"" rule.
3. Now, the walls would no longer be stop, allowing Baba to push them or move through.
4. Then, navigate to the ""win"" rule at 8 right, 1 up, avoiding the walls since they're no longer stop.

Alternatively, after removing the ""stop"" property from walls, move the ""win"" rule's text blocks to make ""baba is win"", so touching Baba would make him win.

But first, let's focus on moving the ""stop"" rule. To do that, the action would be to move left towards the ""stop"" rule.

The previous actions tried moving left, up, etc., but perhaps the correct sequence is to move left to reach the ""stop"" rule.

In the current observation, the ""stop"" rule is at 1 step to the left. So from Baba's position (assumed to be near the ""rule `baba`"" at 3 left, 5 down), moving left once would get to the ""stop"" rule.

Therefore, the action should be ""left"".

Let's see. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I can move Baba around. The goal is usually to reach the ""win"" object, but maybe that's been changed. Looking at the objects, there's a ""door"" and a ""win"" rule. So normally, reaching the door might not win, but if ""win"" is connected to something else, I need to check.

First, I need to figure out where Baba is. The observation doesn't explicitly state Baba's position, but since the rules involve ""baba,"" maybe I'm at the position where the ""baba"" rule is. Let me check the objects. There's a ""rule `baba` 2 step to the left and 5 steps down."" So if I'm at that position, moving up 5 steps would get me to Baba. Wait, but how do I know my current position? The observation lists objects relative to my position, I think. So ""wall 3 steps to the right and 1 step up"" would be three steps right and one up from me.

My current position is probably the starting point. let me try to map this out. The goal is to get to the ""win"" which is at 8 steps right and 1 step up. But there's a wall at 3 steps right and 1 step up blocking the path. Also, there's a ""stop"" rule at 1 step left and 2 step up. So moving right directly towards the ""win"" is blocked by the wall.

Wait, but maybe I can manipulate the rules. The ""rule `is`"" blocks are movable if they're not ""stop"" or similar. So if I can move the ""is"" text blocks to create new rules. For example, if I can make ""baba is win"" or ""door is you,"" that might change things.

Looking at the objects, there's a ""key"" at 1 step right. Maybe I need to get the key first. But how? The key is at 1 step right, but there's a wall at 3 steps right and 1 step up. Maybe moving left towards the key. Wait, the key is 1 step to the right, so if I move right once, I can get the key. But is there a wall in the way? The walls are at 3 steps right and 1 step up, but the key is at 1 step right. So moving right once should reach the key. Once I have the key, maybe I can unlock a door.

Alternatively, the ""door"" is at 1 step left and 4 steps down. If I can make the door a ""stop"" or change its property, but I don't have the key yet. Hmm. Let's check the rules again. The active rule is only ""baba is you."" So I can push other text blocks if they're not stopped.

The ""rule `is`"" blocks are movable. For example, the ""rule `is` 7 steps to the right and 1 step up"" could be moved. If I can move that to create a new rule like ""baba is win,"" then I could become the win condition. But how to reach that rule block?

To get to the ""rule `is`"" at 7 steps right and 1 step up, I need to move right multiple times. But there's a wall at 3 steps right and 1 step up. So moving right past that wall might be blocked unless I change the ""wall"" property. The ""rule `wall` 2 step to the left"" exists. If I can move that ""wall"" rule, perhaps I can remove the wall blocking my path.

So the plan could be: move left to the ""rule `wall`"" at 2 steps left, then move it somewhere else to remove the wall blocking the right path. Then move right past the wall, grab the ""rule `is`"" block at 7 steps right and 1 step up, and rearrange it to say ""baba is win."" Then, as Baba, I would be the win condition, so reaching any ""win"" block (which is at 8 steps right and 1 step up) would complete the level.

Alternatively, maybe there's a door that can be turned into a win. The ""rule `door` 6 steps to the right and 5 steps down"" is present. If I can make ""door is win,"" then reaching the door would win. To do that, I need to move the ""win"" rule and the ""door"" rule next to each other with an ""is"" in between.

But this requires manipulating multiple text blocks. Let me outline the steps:

1. Move left to the ""rule `wall`"" at 2 steps left. Since I'm ""baba is you,"" I can move this rule unless it's stopped. The wall itself is at 3 steps right and 1 step up, but the ""rule `wall`"" is separate. Since ""rule `wall`"" isn't labeled as stop, I can move it.

2. Move the ""rule `wall`"" block out of the way. For example, move it down or left. This would remove the wall blocking the right path.

3. Move right past the removed wall to reach the ""rule `is`"" at 7 steps right and 1 step up.

4. Move that ""rule `is`"" block down or to a side, then bring it next to the ""win"" rule (8 steps right and 1 step up) and the ""baba"" rule (2 steps left and 5 steps down). Arrange them as ""baba is win.""

5. Now, as Baba, moving to the ""win"" block would complete the level.

Alternatively, if I can reach the key first at 1 step right, maybe that provides a way to unlock something, but I'm not sure how the key is used here. The key is probably for a door, but the doors are either at 1 step left and 4 steps down or at 6 steps right and 5 steps down. Without knowing which door the key opens, it's hard to say.

Another angle: the ""rule `you` 5 steps down"" exists. If I can make ""baba is you"" and then change ""you"" to something else, but I already have ""baba is you."" Maybe combining rules. For example, if I make ""you is win,"" then since I'm you, I would be win.

But to do that, I need to move the ""you"" rule and the ""win"" rule with an ""is"" in between. The ""you"" rule is at 1 step left and 5 steps down. The ""win"" rule is at 8 steps right and 1 step up. That's quite far apart. Maybe not straightforward.

Back to the initial plan. Let's focus on removing the wall. To do that, I need to get to the ""rule `wall`"" at 2 steps left. From my current position (assuming I'm at the starting point), moving left twice would reach that ""rule `wall`."" But wait, the observation lists objects relative to my position. Let me confirm:

The objects are described as distances from my current position. For example, ""wall 3 steps to the right and 1 step up"" is three steps right and one up from me. So my current position is the reference point.

The ""rule `wall`"" is at 2 steps left. So to get there, I need to move left twice. But can I move left past any obstacles? The closest obstacle is the ""stop"" rule at 1 step left and 2 step up. Wait, ""rule `stop` 1 step to the left and 2 step up."" So if I move left once, I'm at 1 step left from my current position. But is there a wall there? The ""wall"" at 3 steps right and 1 step up is not in the left direction. The ""wall"" at 2 step left is the ""rule `wall`"" itself, which is a movable text block.

So moving left twice would take me to the ""rule `wall`"" block. Once there, I can move it. Let's say I move it down. Then the wall that was blocking the right path (at 3 steps right and 1 step up) would no longer be there because the ""rule `wall`"" that defined that wall has been moved.

After removing that wall, I can move right past it. Then, navigate to the ""rule `is`"" at 7 steps right and 1 step up. Moving right seven steps from my current position would place me there. Then, I can move that ""rule `is`"" block next to the ""baba"" rule and the ""win"" rule to create ""baba is win.""

But this requires several moves. However, the assistant needs to output a single action. Given the current observation, what's the next immediate action?

Assuming the assistant is trying to reach the ""rule `is`"" block to create a new rule, the next step would be to move right towards it. But there's a wall at 3 steps right and 1 step up. Wait, the wall is defined by the ""rule `wall`"" at 2 steps left. If I haven't moved that yet, then moving right past 3 steps would hit the wall. Therefore, the priority is to first move the ""rule `wall`"" block out of the way.

So the first action should be to move left to the ""rule `wall`"" at 2 steps left, then move it. But how to do that in one action? The assistant needs to choose between up, down, left, right, or idle.

In the current observation, the closest movable object related to the wall is the ""rule `wall`"" at 2 steps left. To reach it, the action should be ""left"" twice. But the assistant can only choose one action at a time. So the immediate action is to move left once to get closer to the ""rule `wall`"" block.

Wait, but in the current observation, the ""rule `wall`"" is 2 steps left. So from my current position, moving left once would bring me to 1 step left. Is there an obstacle there? The ""rule `stop`"" is at 1 step left and 2 step up. But moving left once would place me at 1 step left, but not at the same position as the ""rule `stop`"". The ""rule `stop`"" is two steps up from that position. So moving left once is possible, as there's no ""stop"" blocking movement left. Since I'm ""baba is you,"" and the only immovable things are ""stop"" or similar properties. The ""rule `stop`"" is a text block that makes whatever it's applied to be stop. But the ""rule `stop`"" itself is movable unless it's stopped. Since it's not labeled as stop, I can move it.

Therefore, the next action should be to move left to reach the ""rule `wall`"" block. So the chosen action is ""left"".

I need to figure out the next move in this Baba Is You puzzle. Let's start by understanding the current situation.

The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I can control Baba. My goal is usually to reach the win condition, but I need to check if that's still applicable here. Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ""rule `win` 8 steps to the right and 1 step up."" So the win object is quite far to the right and up a bit. But there are walls blocking the path directly. Maybe I need to rearrange the rules to bypass them.

First, I should check the positions of key objects. There's a key at ""1 step to the right."" If I can get that key, maybe it unlocks something, like a door. But the door is at ""1 step to the left and 4 steps down."" Wait, the door's position might be relative to Baba's current location. Since I'm at the starting point (assuming standard start), I need to navigate to the key first.

Looking at the movement options, I'm currently positioned somewhere, and the objects are described relative to me. The walls are to the left, right, up, and down. The ""rule `is`"" blocks are important because they can be moved to create new rules. For example, if I move a ""rule `win`"" block next to ""baba,"" I can change the win condition. But right now, the win is fixed.

The ""rule `you`"" is at ""1 step to the left and 5 steps down."" Since I'm Baba and the rule is ""baba is you,"" maybe I need to associate another object with ""you"" to control it. But how?

The ""rule `stop`"" blocks are immovable, so I can't push past them unless I change their property. Currently, nothing is making the stop blocks not stop, so I have to go around them.

The key is at 1 step to the right. If I move right, I can get the key. But there's a wall at 3 steps to the right, so moving right three times would hit a wall. Wait, the walls are at varying positions. Let me parse the objects again:

- wall 3 steps to the right and 1 step up
- rule `is` 7 steps to the right and 1 step up
- rule `win` 8 steps to the right and 1 step up
- rule `wall` 2 step to the left
- rule `stop` 1 step to the left
- key 1 step to the right
- wall 3 steps to the right
- wall 3 steps to the right and 1 step down
- etc.

So, from my current position, moving right once gets me to the key (1 step right). But then moving right again would hit the wall at 3 steps right. Wait, no. The wall at 3 steps right is directly to the right, but there's a key at 1 step right. So if I go right once, pick up the key, maybe that helps.

But how do I move? The actions are up, down, left, right, or idle. So I can try moving right to get the key. Let's see:

If I move right once, I reach the key. Then, maybe I can use the key to unlock the door. But the door is at 1 step left and 4 steps down. Wait, that's a bit confusing. The door's position is relative to where? Maybe relative to my current position after moving right. Let's think.

Alternatively, maybe I need to create a new rule. For example, if I move the ""rule `win`"" next to ""baba,"" I could change the win condition. But right now, ""baba is you"" is active, so I can manipulate the rules.

Another approach: The ""rule `you`"" is at 1 step left and 5 steps down. If I can make that ""you"" apply to Baba, then maybe I can move other objects. But ""baba is you"" is already a rule, so maybe that's not necessary.

Wait, the ""rule `baba`"" is at 3 steps left and 5 steps down. If I can move that ""baba"" text block next to another property, like ""win,"" then ""baba is win"" would make Baba the win condition. But how to do that?

To move a text block, I need to be adjacent to it and not be stopped. The ""rule `baba`"" block is 3 steps left and 5 steps down. To reach it, I would have to move left multiple times, but there are walls in the way. Let's check the path.

From my current position, moving left once gets to the ""rule `stop`"" at 1 step left. So I can't move left past that. The ""rule `wall`"" is at 2 steps left, which is also a stop. So moving left directly is blocked. Therefore, I can't reach the ""rule `baba`"" block directly.

Hmm. Maybe I need to go around the stops. The walls are at different positions. Let's see: moving down might lead to a path. For example, the door is at 1 step left and 4 steps down. If I can get to that door and use the key, perhaps it opens. But the door is a ""rule `door`"" block, which is likely a stop unless changed.

Alternatively, if I can make ""door is key,"" then stepping on the door would be possible with the key. But to do that, I need to move the ""key"" rule next to the ""door"" rule.

The ""key"" is at 6 steps to the right and 3 steps down. The ""door"" is at 1 step left and 4 steps down. These positions are quite apart. Maybe moving horizontally first.

Wait, the current active rule is ""baba is you,"" so I can move any object that isn't stopped. The ""rule `is`"" blocks are not stopped, so I can move them. For example, if I move the ""rule `is`"" at 7 steps right and 1 step up, I can create a new rule by placing it next to another rule.

But where would that lead? Let's say I move the ""rule `is`"" to be next to ""baba."" Then I could write ""baba is win,"" making me the win condition. But to do that, I need to reach the ""baba"" text block.

The ""rule `baba`"" is at 3 steps left and 5 steps down. To get there, I need to move left, but there's a ""rule `stop`"" at 1 step left. So maybe I need to rearrange the rules to remove the stop property.

For example, if I can make ""stop is nothing"" or similar, then the stop blocks become passable. But that requires manipulating the existing rules.

Currently, the rules are:

- baba is you
- The other rules are all positioned at various places. The ""rule `stop`"" is at 1 step left and 2 step up. If I can move that ""stop"" rule next to another property, maybe I can change its effect.

Alternatively, if I can create a rule like ""stop is push,"" then the stop blocks would be pushable. But that's a stretch.

Another angle: The ""key"" is at 1 step right. If I pick that up, maybe I can use it on the door. But how? In Baba Is You, typically, a key can unlock a door if they are connected by a ""push"" rule or something. But here, the door is a ""rule `door`,"" so unless we change its property to be unlockable by a key, it won't work.

To make ""door is key,"" I would need to move the ""key"" rule next to the ""door"" rule. The ""key"" is at 6 steps right and 3 steps down, and the ""door"" is at 1 step left and 4 steps down. These are quite far apart. Maybe moving horizontally first to gather the necessary rules.

Alternatively, focus on moving the ""win"" rule closer. The ""win"" is at 8 steps right and 1 step up. If I can make Baba reach that, but it's blocked by walls. So maybe changing the win condition to something else that's reachable.

Wait, the current active rule is ""baba is you,"" so if I can make ""you is win,"" then maybe that changes the win condition. But ""you"" is a property, not an object. The rules are ""[Subject] IS [Property].""

Alternatively, if I can make ""baba is win,"" that would make me the win condition. To do that, I need to move the ""win"" rule next to ""baba."" The ""baba"" rule is at 3 steps left and 5 steps down. So I need to move the ""win"" rule from 8 steps right and 1 step up to be adjacent to the ""baba"" rule.

But how to move the ""win"" rule? It's currently 8 steps to the right and 1 step up. To move it left, I would have to navigate around the walls. The path is blocked by walls at various points. This seems challenging.

Maybe another approach: Use the ""is"" rules to create new rules. For example, if I can move an ""is"" rule next to ""wall"" and ""stop,"" maybe I can change their properties. But that requires being adjacent to those rules.

Alternatively, pick up the ""key"" and use it to unlock the door. But the door is a separate rule. If I can make ""door is key,"" then having the key would allow passing through the door. To create ""door is key,"" I need to move the ""key"" rule next to the ""door"" rule.

The ""key"" is at 6 steps right and 3 steps down. The ""door"" is at 1 step left and 4 steps down. The distance between them is significant. To move the ""key"" rule to the ""door"" location, I need to navigate through the map.

But considering the walls and stops, this might not be straightforward. Let's see the layout again:

- Moving right from my current position: there's a wall at 3 steps right. So I can go right once to get the key at 1 step right, then maybe down or left.

Wait, the key is at 1 step right. If I move right once, I get the key. Then, maybe move down towards the door. The door is at 1 step left and 4 steps down. From the key's position (1 step right), moving left would hit the ""rule `stop`"" at 1 step left. So that's not possible. Alternatively, from the key's position, move down towards the door's location.

But the door's position is 1 step left and 4 steps down from the key's position. So from the key (1R), moving left 1 step would be into the stop, which I can't do. Moving down 4 steps from the key would reach the door's position. But along the way, are there walls?

Looking at the objects, there's a wall at 3 steps right and 2 steps up, among others. But from the key's position (1R), moving down step by step:

- 1R, 1D: is there a wall? The objects below the key's position: at 1R and 1D, is there a wall? The list includes ""wall 2 steps to the right and 1 step down"" and others. Wait, the wall at 2 steps right and 1 step down is further along. So maybe moving down from the key's position (1R) is possible until hitting a wall.

This is getting complicated. Maybe a better approach is to try to move the ""is"" rules to create new rules. For example, if I can create ""key is win,"" then picking up the key would make me the win condition. But to do that, I need to move the ""win"" rule next to the ""key"" rule.

The ""win"" rule is at 8R, 1U. The ""key"" is at 1R. So the distance is huge. Unless there's a way to teleport or something, which I don't think exists here.

Wait, maybe the solution is to push the ""rule `is`"" blocks to form new rules. For example, moving an ""is"" block next to ""baba"" and ""win"" to create ""baba is win.""

But to do that, I need to navigate to the ""baba"" rule at 3L,5D. From my current position, moving left is blocked by stops. So perhaps I need to move down first.

Alternatively, use the ""is"" blocks that are closer. There's an ""is"" block at 7R,1U (same as the ""win"" rule's position). If I can move that ""is"" block down to be next to the ""baba"" rule, then I could create ""baba is win.""

But the ""is"" block at 7R,1U is quite far. To get there, I would have to move right multiple times, but there's a wall at 3R. So moving right once gets to the key, then right again would hit the wall. So that's not possible.

Hmm. This is tricky. Let me recap:

Current active rule: Baba is you.

Key location: 1 step right.

Door location: 1 step left and 4 steps down (relative to key's position).

Walls block direct paths left and right.

Possible actions: move up, down, left, right, or idle.

I need to find a sequence of moves to either reach the win condition by changing rules or navigating around obstacles.

Another idea: The ""rule `you`"" is at 1L,5D. If I can make ""you"" apply to another object, like the door, then maybe stepping on the door would work. But how?

Alternatively, make ""door is push,"" allowing me to move it out of the way. But that requires creating the rule ""door is push.""

To do that, I need an ""is"" block next to ""door"" and ""push."" The ""push"" rule isn't present, so I can't create it unless I have a text block for ""push."" But the initial rules don't include ""push.""

Wait, the initial rules are ""baba is you,"" and other rules are ""is,"" ""win,"" ""wall,"" ""stop,"" ""key,"" ""door."" So ""push"" isn't a defined property here. Unless I can create it by moving ""is"" next to ""door"" and ""push,"" but there's no ""push"" text block.

This seems stuck. Maybe the solution is to move the ""win"" rule closer. But how?

Alternatively, use the key to unlock the door. If the door is a rule, maybe having the key nearby allows it to be passed. But in Baba Is You, typically, you need to have the key in your inventory and then step on the door. But the mechanics might differ here.

Wait, in some levels, picking up the key allows you to unlock the door by being in the same tile. But here, the door is a rule `door`, which is a stop. Unless we change its property.

Another approach: Make ""stop is nothing,"" turning the stop blocks into nothingness. To do that, I need to create the rule ""stop is nothing."" But ""nothing"" isn't a predefined property here. The available properties are is, win, wall, stop, key, door, you, baba.

So ""stop is nothing"" isn't possible unless ""nothing"" is a text block, which it isn't.

Alternatively, ""stop is push,"" making stop blocks pushable. But again, ""push"" isn't a property here.

Wait, the available text blocks are the ones present on the map. The rules are made by combining subjects and properties. The current text blocks are:

- baba
- is
- win
- wall
- stop
- key
- door
- you

So possible rules are combinations of these. For example, ""baba is key"" would make Baba a key, allowing him to unlock doors. But to create that rule, I need to move the ""key"" text block next to the ""baba"" text block.

The ""baba"" text block is at 3L,5D. The ""key"" is at 6R,3D. The distance is quite large. To move the ""key"" there, I need to navigate around the walls.

But considering the walls, maybe there's a path. Let's map it out:

From current position:

- Moving right once gets to the key (1R).
- From there, moving down towards the door's location (1L,4D from key), but can't move left past the stop at 1L.
- Maybe move down and then right? But there's a wall at 3R.

Alternatively, after getting the key at 1R, move down several steps. Let's see:

From key (1R):

- Down 1: position 1R,1D. Is there a wall? Yes, ""wall 2 steps to the right and 1 step down"" is further along. So maybe at 1R,1D, it's passable.

- Continue down to 1R,2D: Are there walls? The objects list includes ""wall 2 steps to the right and 2 steps down"" and ""rule `is` 2 steps to the right and 3 steps down."" So at 1R,2D, it's passable.

- Down to 1R,3D: ""rule `is`"" is at 2R,3D. So at 1R,3D, it's passable.

- Down to 1R,4D: ""door"" is at 1L,4D. From 1R,4D, moving left 1 step would reach the door's position (0R,4D?), but the door is at 1L,4D relative to the original position. Wait, this is getting confusing with relative positions.

Perhaps it's better to think in absolute coordinates. Assume my starting position is (0,0). Then:

- Objects are described relative to me.

- For example, ""wall 2 steps to the right"" is at (2,0).

- ""rule `is` 6 steps to the right and 1 step up"" is at (6,1).

- The key is at (1,0).

- The door is at (-1, -4) (1 step left and 4 steps down from my starting position).

This might help visualize the map.

So the map in absolute coordinates:

- (2,1): wall

- (6,1): rule `is`

- (7,1): rule `win`

- (-2,0): rule `wall`

- (-1,0): rule `stop`

- (1,0): key

- (3,","

Let's try to figure out what to do here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I can move and manipulate objects. The goal is usually to reach a ""win"" object, but maybe that's changed? Let me check the objects on the map.

Looking at the objects, there's a ""key"" at 1 step to the right. Maybe I need to get the key first to unlock something, but I don't see a lock. The ""door"" is mentioned, but it's not clear if I need a key for it. The ""win"" rule is all the way at 8 steps to the right, which is pretty far. There are walls blocking the path to the right, so I probably need to move left or find another way around.

I notice there are several ""rule `is`"" blocks scattered around. Since I can move text blocks, maybe I can rearrange the rules to change what I can do. For example, if I can make ""baba is win,"" then stepping on ""baba"" would make me the win object. Or maybe ""you is key"" so I can pick up the key. Let me see where the ""is"" rules are.

There's a ""rule `is`"" at 7 steps right and 1 step up. If I can move that to connect ""baba"" with another property, like ""win"" or ""key,"" that might help. But to do that, I need to move the ""is"" text block. Are there any ""stop"" or ""wall"" properties that are blocking my movement?

The walls are at 3 steps right and varying downs. The ""stop"" is at 1 step left and 1 step up. So moving left might be possible if I'm not stepping on a ""stop."" Let me check my current position. I assume I'm at the starting point, maybe near the left side since the key is to the right. 

If I go left, towards the ""rule `you`"" at 1 step left and 5 steps down, maybe I can combine that with ""baba is you"" to make myself the you object, but I already am. Hmm. Alternatively, moving the ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" and ""win"" to create ""baba is win."" But how to get there?

The path to the right is blocked by walls, so maybe moving down towards the ""rule `is`"" at 2 steps right and 3 steps down. If I can get there and rearrange the rules, that could work. Let's see. To get down, I need to move down step by step, avoiding stops and walls. The wall at 3 steps right and 4 steps down might be a problem. Maybe moving down 3 steps first, then right?

Alternatively, check if there's a way to make the door the win condition. If I can create ""door is win,"" then reaching the door would be the solution. But the door is at 1 step left and 4 steps down. To get there, I need to move left and down, but there are walls and stops in the way. The ""stop"" is at 1 step left and 1 step up, so moving left from my current position might hit that stop. Wait, maybe my current position is somewhere else. 

This is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to outline the possible steps:

1. Move towards the ""rule `is`"" blocks to create new rules.
2. Create a rule that makes ""baba"" equal to ""win"" so stepping on myself would win.
3. Alternatively, create ""key is you"" to pick up the key and use it on the door.
4. Navigate around walls and stops to reach the necessary rules.

Since the ""win"" is far to the right, maybe the intended solution is to change the win condition. If I can move a ""win"" rule somewhere else, like next to ""baba,"" then stepping on ""baba"" would trigger the win. But the existing ""win"" is at 8 steps right, which is blocked. 

Another angle: The ""rule `baba`"" is at 3 steps left and 5 steps down. If I can move that ""baba"" text block next to an ""is"" and a ""win,"" creating ""baba is win,"" that would make me win. But I need to move the ""baba"" block, which might require breaking existing rules or pushing past stops. 

Wait, the ""stop"" is at 1 step left and 1 step up. So moving left from my current position might be possible if I'm not on a stop. Let me assume I'm positioned somewhere central. Maybe I need to move left to reach the ""rule `you`"" at 1 step left and 5 steps down. If I can make ""you is win,"" then moving onto the ""you"" block would make me win. 

But how to get there? The path left might be clear. Let me check the objects again. The walls are at 3 steps right and various positions. To go left, I need to move left past the ""stop"" at 1 step left and 1 step up. So if I'm not in that area, moving left should be possible. 

Alternatively, move down towards the ""rule `is`"" at 2 steps right and 3 steps down. If I can get there and attach ""baba"" and ""win"" to it, that could work. But I need to navigate around the walls. 

This is tricky. Maybe the simplest way is to keep moving left towards the ""you"" rule and see if I can combine it with a ""win"" rule. Alternatively, pick up the key and use it on the door, but there's no lock mentioned. 

Alternatively, create ""door is stop"" to remove its stop property, but that might not help. 

Hmm. The key is at 1 step right. If I can get the key, maybe it's used to unlock the door, but the door's position is 1 step left and 4 steps down. To reach the door, I need to move left and down, but there's a wall at 3 steps right and 4 steps down. Maybe moving down first then left? 

Wait, perhaps the solution is to move the ""rule `is`"" next to ""baba"" and ""win."" Let's see: The ""rule `is`"" is at 7 steps right and 1 step up. If I move that left towards the ""baba"" rule at 3 steps left and 5 steps down, that's a long way. Maybe there's a closer ""is"" rule. There's another ""is"" at 2 steps right and 3 steps down. If I can move that ""is"" next to ""baba"" and ""win,"" that would create the desired rule. 

To do that, I need to move down to reach that ""is"" block. So actions would be: down, down, down, right, right, etc. But I have to avoid walls and stops. 

Alternatively, check if the current rules can be manipulated. Since ""baba is you,"" I can move text blocks. The key is at 1 step right, so maybe moving right to get the key, but there's a wall at 3 steps right. Wait, no, the walls are at varying positions. Let me recheck the map.

The objects listed are:

- Wall 3 steps right and 1 step up
- rule `is` 7 right, 1 up
- rule `win` 8 right, 1 up
- rule `wall` 2 left
- rule `stop` 1 left
- key 1 right
- wall 3 right
- wall 3 right and 1 down
- etc.

So the path to the right beyond 3 steps is blocked by walls. The key is at 1 step right, which is closer. If I can move right to get the key, then maybe use it somewhere. But how?

If I move right once, I reach the key at 1 step right. Then pick it up? But the game mechanics don't mention picking up keys; maybe the key is just an object to move. If I have ""baba is you,"" I can move the key. But why would that help? Unless there's a lock somewhere not mentioned. 

Alternatively, the door is at 1 step left and 4 steps down. If I can move the door, but it's probably defined as a stop. 

This is really challenging. Maybe the intended solution is to create a rule that makes ""baba"" the win. So find an ""is"" block and place it next to ""baba"" and ""win."" The existing ""win"" is at 8 steps right, which is blocked. But there's another ""win"" rule at 7 steps right and 1 step up (same as the ""is"" there). If I can move that ""win"" down to where ""baba"" is, that would work. 

But to move the ""win"" rule, I need to push it past any stops or walls. The ""stop"" is at 1 step left and 1 step up, which isn't in the way. The path to the left of the ""win"" rule is clear. So moving the ""win"" rule left to align with ""baba"" at 3 steps left and 5 steps down. But that's a long distance. 

Alternatively, move the ""is"" rule from 7 right,1 up to between ""baba"" and ""win."" For example, move the ""is"" left to 6 right,1 up, then maybe 5 right,1 up, etc., until it's next to ""baba"" and ""win."" But that requires multiple moves and avoiding walls. 

Alternatively, since the ""rule `baba`"" is at 3 left and 5 down, and there's a ""rule `is`"" at 2 right and 3 down, maybe move the ""is"" down to 2 right,4 down, then place it next to ""baba"" and ""win."" But I'm not sure. 

This is getting too complicated. Maybe the best immediate action is to keep moving left towards the ""you"" rule at 1 left and 5 down, hoping to create a ""you is win"" rule. To do that, I need to get to that ""you"" rule and have an ""is"" nearby. The ""is"" is at 1 left and 5 down (same position as ""you"")? Wait, the ""rule `you`"" is at 1 step left and 5 steps down, and there's a ""rule `is`"" at 2 steps right and 3 steps down. Maybe I can move the ""is"" down to 1 left and 5 down, placing it next to ""you"" and ""win."" 

But how to move the ""is"" block there? The path might be blocked by walls. 

Alternatively, the current active rule is ""baba is you,"" so I am Baba. If I can reach the ""win"" object, which is a rule at 8 right,1 up, but that's blocked. Maybe the actual win condition is a tile on the map labeled ""win,"" but in the observations, the ""win"" is a rule. So to win, I need to have a rule that makes Baba equal to Win. 

Given all this, perhaps the correct action is to move towards the ""is"" rule at 7 right,1 up and rearrange it to connect ""baba"" and ""win."" But to do that, I need to move left multiple times, avoiding walls. 

Alternatively, since the ""key"" is nearby at 1 right, maybe pick it up and use it on the door. But without knowing the level layout, it's hard to say. 

Given the time I've spent and the previous failed actions, maybe the best guess is to keep moving left towards the ""you"" rule to potentially create a ""you is win"" rule. So the action would be ""left.""

The goal is to reach the ""win"" object, which is usually a door or something similar. Right now, the active rule is ""baba is you,"" meaning I can move Baba around. I need to figure out how to get to the win condition.

Looking at the objects, the ""win"" is 8 steps to the right. There's a wall at 3 steps right, so I can't go straight right. There's a key at 1 step right. Maybe I need to get the key first? But how? The key is surrounded by walls on the right. Wait, there's a rule ""is"" at 7 steps right. Rules can be moved, right? If I can move the ""is"" rule, maybe I can create a new rule. 

But to move the ""is"" rule, I have to be able to move it. Since Baba is ""you,"" I can push objects that aren't ""stop."" The ""is"" rule isn't a stop, so I can move it. Let me see. From my current position, if I move left multiple times, maybe I can reach the ""is"" rule. Wait, the ""is"" is at 7 steps right and 1 step up. So from my current position (assuming I'm at the starting point, maybe?), moving right 7 steps would get to the ""is."" But there are walls blocking the way. The wall at 3 steps right might be in the way. 

Alternatively, maybe I need to rearrange the ""is"" rule to create a new rule like ""key is win"" or ""baba is win."" If I can move the ""is"" to be next to the key and the win, maybe I can make ""key is win,"" then pick up the key and walk into it. Or make ""baba is win"" so that touching anything makes me win. 

But first, how to get to the ""is"" rule. Let's check the map again. The ""is"" is at 7 steps right, 1 step up. The current position of Baba might be somewhere else, but the exact starting point isn't clear. However, the key is at 1 step right, which is closer. Maybe I should go get the key first. But the key is at 1 step right, but there's a wall at 3 steps right. Wait, the key is at 1 step to the right from the player's position? Let me parse the objects again.

The objects listed are:

- wall 3 steps to the right and 1 step up
- rule `is` 7 steps to the right and 1 step up
- rule `win` 8 steps to the right and 1 step up
- rule `wall` 2 step to the left
- rule `stop` 1 step to the left
- key 1 step to the right
- wall 3 steps to the right
- etc. down below.

So the player is probably at position (0,0), and the key is at (1,0). But there's a wall at (3,0). So to get to the key at (1,0), I can move right once. But is (1,0) blocked by anything? The key is at 1 step right, and the rule `stop` is at 1 step to the left. Wait, the rule `stop` is at 1 step to the left of the player, so that's (-1,0). So moving right to (1,0) would reach the key. But is there a wall there? The key is listed as an object, so it's separate from walls. So moving right once would get the key. Once I have the key, maybe I can use it to unlock the door. 

But the door is at 1 step left and 4 steps down. That's (-1,4). Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, the ""win"" is at (8,1). To get there, I need to move right past several walls. The walls are at 3, 2, etc. steps. So maybe moving right isn't the way. 

Another approach: since ""baba is you,"" I can move any object that isn't ""stop."" The ""stop"" rule is at 1 step left, so anything defined as stop can't be moved. The walls are defined as ""wall,"" which might be stop? Or is ""wall"" a separate property. In Baba Is You, sometimes ""wall is stop"" is a rule, which makes walls immovable. But in the current active rules, the only rules are ""baba is you."" So walls might be movable unless there's a rule like ""wall is stop."" Since there's no such rule here, the walls can be pushed. 

So maybe I can push the walls aside to create a path. For example, if there's a wall at 3 steps right, I can push it left if I'm behind it. But to do that, I need to be adjacent to the wall and move in the opposite direction. 

Alternatively, create a new rule. The key is at 1 step right. If I can move the ""is"" rule to create ""key is win,"" then picking up the key would make it a win condition. Let's see. The ""is"" rule is at 7 steps right, 1 step up. If I can move that ""is"" rule next to the key and the win rule, I can make ""key is win."" 

To move the ""is"" rule, I need to be adjacent to it and move it. The ""is"" is at (7,1). The player's position isn't clear, but assuming the player is at (0,0), moving right 7 steps would reach (7,0), but the ""is"" is at (7,1). So the player would need to move up to (7,1) to grab the ""is"" rule. But there are walls blocking the path. For example, at (3,0) there's a wall. So moving right from (0,0) to (3,0) is blocked by the wall. Therefore, can't go straight right. 

Maybe go around the walls. The walls are at various positions, but perhaps there's a path downward. For example, moving down from the starting position, maybe there's a way to get to the ""is"" rule. 

Alternatively, use the existing rules to change properties. Since ""baba is you,"" I can move any non-stop object. The ""is"" rule isn't stop, so I can move it. Let's say I move the ""is"" rule to be next to the key and the win. For example, move ""is"" to the key's position, then create ""key is win."" But how to do that in steps. 

First, move to the ""is"" rule's location. From (0,0), moving right 7 steps would reach (7,0), but the ""is"" is at (7,1). So need to move up to (7,1). But the path might be blocked. There's a wall at (3,0), but moving up from (0,0) to (0,1), then right to (7,1). Are there walls along that path? The walls are at 3 steps right and 1 step up, which is (3,1). So from (0,1), moving right 7 steps would pass through (3,1) which is a wall. So can't go that way. 

Alternative path: move down from the starting position. Let's see. The objects down below include rule `is` at 1 step to the right and 3 steps down (from original position?), but this is getting complicated without a visual. 

Alternatively, focus on the existing ""is"" rules. There are multiple ""is"" rules scattered. The main one is at (7,1). If I can move that to be next to the key (1 step right, which is (1,0)) and the win (8,1), then I can create ""key is win"" or ""baba is win."" 

But moving the ""is"" from (7,1) to (1,0) would require moving left 6 steps and down 1 step. Is that possible? The player would have to navigate around the walls. 

Alternatively, use another ""is"" rule that's closer. For example, there's an ""is"" rule at 1 step to the right and 1 step down (from the initial position). So (1,-1). If I can move that ""is"" to create a new rule. 

Suppose I move that ""is"" to be next to the ""key"" at (1,0). Then I can write ""key is win."" To do that, I need to be adjacent to both the ""is"" and the ""key,"" then move the ""is"" next to the ""key"" and the ""win."" 

Let me outline steps:

1. Move to the ""is"" rule at (1,-1).
2. Push it right to (2,-1).
3. Then move down to be next to the key at (1,0).
4. Push the ""is"" to (1,0), creating ""key is win.""
5. Then go pick up the key and touch the win object, which is now a key.

But how to navigate there. Starting from (0,0):

- Move down once to (0,-1).
- Move right to (1,-1) where the ""is"" rule is.
- Push the ""is"" rule right to (2,-1).
- Move down to (2,-2).
- Move left to (1,-2).
- Move up to (1,-1), which has the key? Wait, the key is at 1 step to the right, which would be (1,0). Maybe this approach isn't straightforward. 

Alternatively, focus on the upper ""is"" rule at (7,1). To reach it, need to move right past walls. But walls are at (3,0), (2,0), etc. Maybe move down first to avoid walls. 

From (0,0), move down to (0,-1). Then right to (1,-1) where there's an ""is"" rule. Push that ""is"" right to (2,-1). Then move up to (2,0). But there's a wall at (3,0), so can't go right. 

This is getting complicated. Maybe the simplest way is to create a rule that makes Baba win. For example, ""baba is win."" To do that, take an ""is"" rule and place it next to ""baba"" and ""win."" 

The ""baba"" rule is at 3 steps to the left and 5 steps down. So if I can move an ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" and ""win,"" then create ""baba is win."" 

But the ""win"" is at (8,1), which is far away. How to get there? Maybe after creating the rule, Baba becomes win, so touching anything wins. 

Alternatively, create ""you is win,"" but since Baba is you, that would make you win, which is the same. 

Alternatively, pick up the key and use it on the door. But the door is at (-1,4), which is left and down. 

This is tricky. Let me think again. The key is at (1,0). If I can move to (1,0), pick up the key, then move to the door at (-1,4) and use the key. But how to open the door? Maybe the door's rule is ""door is stop,"" so unless changed, it's blocked. 

If I can change the door's property to not be stop, then I can pass through. For example, ""door is you"" or ""door is win."" 

But to do that, need to move an ""is"" rule next to the door and the new property. 

The door is at (-1,4). There's a rule `door` at 6 steps to the right and 5 steps down, which is (6,-1) from the starting point? Not sure. 

This is getting too vague without a map visualization. Maybe the best approach is to focus on moving the ""is"" rule to create a new rule that makes touching the win object possible. 

For example, move the ""is"" at (7,1) down to (7,0), then left to (6,0), etc., until it's next to the ""win"" rule at (8,1). But the path is blocked by walls. 

Alternatively, use the lower ""is"" rules. The one at 1 step to the right and 3 steps down (from starting position) is (1,-3). Move that ""is"" up to (1,0), next to the key, then create ""key is win."" 

Steps:

1. Move to (1,-3) where the ""is"" rule is.
2. Push it up to (1,-2), (1,-1), (1,0).
3. Now, at (1,0), place ""is"" next to key and win.
4. But the ""win"" is at (8,1), which is far away. Instead, create ""key is win"" by placing ""is"" between key and win. But the key is at (1,0), and win is at (8,1). Not adjacent. 

Hmm. Maybe create ""baba is win"" instead. The ""baba"" rule is at (3,-5) (since it's 3 steps left and 5 steps down from starting position). To get there:

1. Move down from (0,0) to (0,-1), (0,-2), etc., until reaching (3,-5) where ""baba"" rule is.
2. Bring an ""is"" rule next to it and the ""win"" rule. 

But the ""win"" is at (8,1), which is up and to the right. This seems impossible without moving through walls. 

Alternatively, use the existing ""is"" rules to create a new rule closer. 

Another idea: since the key is at (1,0), and the ""win"" is at (8,1), maybe create a rule like ""key is win"" by placing ""is"" between them. But they are not adjacent. So that won't work. 

Wait, perhaps the key is at 1 step to the right (so (1,0)), and there's a rule `key` at 6 steps to the right and 1 step down (from starting position), which would be (6,-1). If I can move the ""is"" rule to be next to both the key and the win, then create ""key is win."" 

But the key and win are not adjacent. The win is at (8,1), key at (1,0). Not near each other. 

This is really challenging. Maybe the solution is to move the ""is"" rule to create ""baba is win,"" making touching anything a win. To do that, I need to get the ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" and ""win."" 

The ""baba"" rule is at (3,-5), and ""win"" is at (8,1). The distance is too great. 

Alternative approach: Use the lower part of the map. There's a ""door"" at (-1,4) and a ""rule door"" at (6,-1). Maybe create ""door is win"" to make the door a win condition. 

To do that:

1. Find an ""is"" rule, move it next to ""door"" and ""win.""
2. The ""door"" is at (-1,4), and ""win"" is at (8,1). Not adjacent. 

Alternatively, create ""you is win"" since Baba is you. So if I can make ""you is win,"" then touching anything makes me win. 

The ""you"" rule is at 1 step to the left and 3 steps down (from starting position?), which is (-1,-3). To get there:

1. Move left to (-1,0), then down to (-1,-3) where the ""you"" rule is.
2. Bring an ""is"" rule next to ""you"" and ""win.""
3. Place ""is"" between them to make ""you is win.""

But ""win"" is at (8,1), so not adjacent. 

This seems impossible. Maybe the intended solution is to move the ""is"" rule to create ""baba is win"" by somehow positioning it. 

Alternatively, pick up the key and use it on the door. If the door is a ""stop,"" but if I make the door not stop, then I can pass. 

To make the door not stop, I need to change its property. For example, ""door is you"" or ""door is win."" 

The door is at (-1,4). There's a ""rule door"" at (6,-1). Maybe move that ""door"" rule to be next to the door object and a different property. 

But this is too vague. 

Given the time I've spent and the previous actions, maybe the correct move is to keep moving left towards the ""is"" rules to rearrange them. The last few actions were left, left, down, left, etc., trying to navigate towards the ""is"" rules. Perhaps the next step is to move left again to reach the ""is"" rule at 1 step to the left and 5 steps down, then move it to create the desired rule. 

Alternatively, move down to reach the ""is"" rule at 1 step right and 3 steps down, then move it up to be next to the key. 

But without knowing the exact map layout, it's hard to say. Given the previous observations, the latest valid action before the failure was ""left,"" but the system defaulted to idle. Maybe the correct action now is to move down to reach a lower ""is"" rule. 

Alternatively, since the player is stuck moving left and not making progress, perhaps the solution is to move towards the ""is"" rule at 7 steps right, 1 step up by moving right despite the walls, but that seems impossible. 

Wait, the active rules are still ""baba is you,"" so walls can be pushed. Maybe push the walls aside to create a path. For example, push the wall at 3 steps right to the left, creating a passage. 

To push a wall, be adjacent to it and move in the direction opposite to where you want to push it. So if there's a wall at (3,0), I can stand next to it and move left, pushing it to (2,0). 

But the key is at (1,0), so pushing the wall at (3,0) leftward would create a path from (2,0) to (3,0). Then I can move right past the wall to (4,0), etc. 

Let's try that:

1. Move right to (1,0) to get the key.
2. Move right to (2,0), but there's a wall at (3,0). So stand at (2,0","

Your previous output did not contain a valid action. Defaulted to action: idle

41,down,"<reasoning>
Let's take a look at the current state of the Baba Is You level. The active rule is still ""baba is you,"" which means I can manipulate other objects by moving the ""is"" rule text blocks.

First, I need to check what objects are present. The map has several walls, keys, doors, and rule texts. The key is located 1 step to the right, and there's a door that's probably the exit. The door might be ""stop"" or have another property blocking me from passing through it. 

Looking at the objects, I see ""rule `you` 5 steps down."" Since the default is that Baba is the player (""baba is you""), but here there's a ""you"" rule 5 steps down. Maybe that's a way to make another object the player. Also, there's a ""rule `is`"" block next to ""you,"" which I can move to reconfigure the rules.

My goal is to reach the ""win"" condition, which is likely the door. But the door might be defined as ""stop"" or require a key. The key is 1 step to the right, so maybe I need to get that first. However, moving right might be blocked by walls. 

Wait, the key is 1 step to the right. If I move right, but there's a wall at 3 steps to the right. Wait, no—current position isn't specified, but the key is 1 step to the right. If I'm at position 0, moving right once gets me to the key. But there's a wall at 3 steps right. So maybe I need to move the ""is"" rule to change the key's property or make it movable.

Alternatively, since I'm Baba and can push objects that aren't ""stop,"" maybe I can push the key towards me. But the key is 1 step to the right. If I move right, I might pick up the key. However, if there's a wall blocking the path, that's a problem. 

Looking at the rules, there's a ""rule `stop` 1 step to the left."" So anything that's ""stop"" can't be moved. The walls might be ""stop"" properties. If I can change the ""wall"" rule to something else, maybe I can pass through them. 

The ""rule `is`"" blocks are scattered around. If I can move one of them to create a new rule, like ""key is push"" or ""door is not stop,"" that could help. For example, if I move the ""is"" block next to ""you"" (5 steps down) to make ""baba is you"" again, but that's redundant. Alternatively, take the ""is"" block at 7 steps right and 1 step up (which is part of the ""win"" rule) and move it to link ""baba"" with another property. 

Wait, the ""win"" rule is 8 steps to the right. To make Baba the win, I could move the ""is"" next to ""win"" to say ""baba is win."" But I need to find the ""is"" block near the win rule. The ""is"" is at 7 steps right and 1 step up, which is adjacent to ""win"" at 8 steps right. So if I move that ""is"" to connect Baba with win, then ""baba is win"" would make me the win condition, letting me touch the door to win. 

But how do I move that ""is"" block? To move an object, it can't be ""stop."" The ""is"" block itself isn't stop unless there's a rule saying so. Looking at the active rules, there's ""rule `stop` 1 step to the left,"" so unless the ""is"" is under a stop rule, it's movable. The ""is"" at 7 steps right and 1 step up is probably movable. 

So the plan would be: move the ""is"" block from (7 right, 1 up) to connect ""baba"" with ""win."" To do that, I need to navigate to that ""is"" block, pick it up (by moving right towards it), and then move it to the ""baba"" rule which is at 3 steps left and 5 steps down. Wait, the ""baba"" rule is at 2 steps left and 5 steps down. Hmm, coordinates might be a bit confusing here. 

Alternatively, the ""baba"" rule is located 3 steps to the left and 5 steps down from the current position. To reach the ""is"" block at 7 right and 1 up, maybe I need to move right multiple times, but there are walls at 3 steps right. Wait, the walls are at 3 steps right and various down positions. So moving right from my current position (assuming I'm at 0,0) would hit the wall at 3 steps right. That's a problem. 

Perhaps I need to find another path. If I move down towards the ""you"" rule at 5 steps down, there's an ""is"" block there. Maybe I can use that to create a new rule. For example, moving the ""is"" at 1 step left and 5 steps down to make ""baba is you"" again, but that's already the case. Alternatively, use it to make ""door is not stop."" 

The door is at 1 step left and 4 steps down. If I can change its property from ""stop"" to something else, like ""push"" or remove the ""stop"" rule, then I can move through it. 

Looking at the objects, there's a ""rule `stop` 1 step to the left and 2 step up."" That's probably defining the walls as stop. If I can remove that ""stop"" rule, the walls wouldn't block me anymore. But how? To delete a rule, I might need to move it off the screen or overwrite it with another rule. 

Alternatively, create a rule that says ""stop is nothing,"" effectively removing the stop property. But I need the correct syntax. 

Another approach: since I'm Baba and can be ""you,"" maybe I can push the door if it's not stop. If I can make the door ""push,"" then I can move it out of the way. But to do that, I need to create a rule like ""door is push."" 

To create such a rule, I'd need to move the ""is"" block next to ""door"" and then link it to ""push."" The ""push"" property isn't defined in the current active rules, so maybe I can create it. 

The ""is"" block at 2 steps right and 3 steps down is next to the key. If I move that ""is"" to connect door with push, but where is the ""push"" text? It doesn't exist on the map, so I'd have to create it by placing ""door IS push"" using existing text blocks. Wait, the rules are formed by text blocks that are on the map. So to create a new rule, I need to have the subject and property somewhere. 

The available text blocks are ""baba,"" ""win,"" ""wall,"" ""stop,"" ""key,"" ""door,"" ""is,"" and ""you."" So to make ""door is push,"" I need a ""push"" text block, which isn't present. Therefore, I can't create that rule directly. 

Maybe another approach: use the existing ""win"" rule. If I can make Baba the win, then touching the door (which is win) would make me win. To do that, I need to move the ""is"" from the ""win"" rule to connect Baba with win. 

The ""win"" rule is at 8 steps right and 1 step up. The adjacent ""is"" is at 7 steps right and 1 step up. So if I move that ""is"" to the ""baba"" rule, which is at 3 steps left and 5 steps down, then I can form ""baba IS win."" 

But how to get to that ""is"" block? My current position isn't clear, but the key is 1 step to the right. If I move right to get the key, then maybe I can use that to gain access. However, moving right might be blocked by walls. 

Alternatively, move down towards the ""you"" rule. The ""is"" block at 1 step left and 5 steps down could be moved to link ""baba"" with ""win."" Let's see: the ""baba"" rule is at 3 steps left and 5 steps down. If I move the ""is"" next to ""you"" (which is at 1 step left and 5 steps down) to the ""baba"" rule, then it would create ""baba IS you,"" but that's redundant. 

Wait, perhaps I need to move the ""is"" from the ""win"" rule (7 right, 1 up) to the ""baba"" rule (3 left, 5 down). To do that, I need to navigate from my current position to the ""is"" block, pick it up, and move it to the ""baba"" rule's location. 

Assuming I'm at the starting position, say (0,0), the ""is"" block is at (7,1). Moving right 7 times and up 1 would get there, but there are walls at 3 steps right. So that path is blocked. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to rearrange rules step by step. For example, first move the ""is"" block next to ""key"" (7 right, 3 down) to create a new rule. If I make ""key is push,"" then I can push the key to reach the ""is"" block for the win rule. But again, there's no ""push"" text block. 

This is tricky. Maybe the key isn't necessary right now. If I can make the door not a stop, then I can walk through it. The door is at 1 step left and 4 steps down. There's a ""rule `door` 5 steps to the right and 5 steps down,"" but that's probably defining something else. 

Looking at the active rules, ""baba is you"" is the only one. All other rules are ""wall IS wall,"" ""stop IS stop,"" etc., which are default immovable rules. 

Another idea: since ""you"" is defined 5 steps down, maybe I can make myself ""you"" again, but that's already the case. 

Wait, the ""you"" rule is at 1 step left and 5 steps down. If I can move that ""is"" block (which is at 2 step left and 5 steps down) to connect ""baba"" with ""you,"" but that's redundant. 

Alternatively, move the ""is"" block next to ""win"" (7 right, 1 up) to the ""baba"" rule (3 left, 5 down). To do that, I need to get the ""is"" block from (7,1) to (3,-4), which is a significant move. Given the walls, this might not be feasible. 

Perhaps the solution is to move the ""is"" block near the ""win"" to the ""baba"" location. Let's try to calculate the steps. From (7,1) to (3,-4): move left 4 steps and down 5 steps. But along the way, there are walls at 3 steps right, so moving left from 7 would go through open spaces. 

If I can move left from the ""is"" block at (7,1) four times to reach x=3, then down five times to y=-4. But need to check if the path is blocked. The map shows walls at various positions, but if there's a clear path, this might work. 

Assuming I can move the ""is"" block left and down, then placing it next to ""baba"" would create ""baba IS win,"" making me the win condition. Then, touching the door (which is win) would complete the level. 

So the steps would be: 
1. Navigate to the ""is"" block at (7,1). 
2. Pick it up and move left 4 steps to x=3. 
3. Move down 5 steps to y=-4, placing it next to the ""baba"" rule. 
4. Now ""baba IS win"" is active, so touching the door (which is win) makes me win. 

But how to navigate there given the current position? The key is at 1 step right, so maybe I'm near there. If I move right to get the key, then use it to push objects? Wait, the key is 1 step right, so moving right once takes me to the key. But there's a wall at 3 steps right, so maybe the key is at (1,0). 

Alternatively, maybe the player's starting position is near the key. If I pick up the key, perhaps I can use it to unlock something, but there's no lock in the current rules. 

This is getting complicated. Maybe the simplest way is to focus on moving the ""is"" block near the ""win"" rule to the ""baba"" rule. To do that, I need to move left and down. Let's try to execute that step by step. 

First, move right to reach the ""is"" block at (7,1). But there's a wall at (3,0), so moving right from (0,0) to (3,0) is blocked. Therefore, this path isn't possible. 

Alternative route: move down to the lower part of the map where the ""you"" rule is. From there, move left and up to reach the ""is"" block. 

The ""is"" block at 1 step left and 5 steps down is near the ""you"" rule. If I can move that ""is"" block to connect ""baba"" with something else. For example, move it to the ""win"" rule at (8,1). But that's far. 

Alternatively, use the ""is"" block at (7,1) which is near the ""win"" rule. To get there, maybe move down from the upper part. But without knowing the exact starting position, it's hard to say. 

Perhaps the key is to realize that the door is a ""door"" and maybe can be made ""win"" by redefining rules. Since the door's position is 1 step left and 4 steps down, if I can make ""door is win,"" then touching it would win. To do that, I need an ""is"" block next to ""door"" and ""win."" 

The ""win"" rule is at (8,1), and the door is at ( -1, -4) assuming starting at (0,0). The ""is"" block near the win is at (7,1). If I can move that ""is"" to the door's position, connecting door with win. 

So move the ""is"" from (7,1) to ( -1, -4), which is left 8 steps and down 5 steps. That's a long move, but if possible, it would create ""door IS win,"" making the door the win condition. 

Alternatively, create ""baba IS door"" to make touching the door win. To do that, move an ""is"" block next to ""baba"" and ""door."" The ""baba"" rule is at ( -3, -5), and the door is at ( -1, -4). So moving an ""is"" block from (7,1) to between ""baba"" and ""door."" That would require moving left 8 steps and down 5 steps, which is feasible if the path is clear. 

Given the walls are at various positions, but assuming the path is possible, this could work. 

In summary, the best action is to move the ""is"" block associated with the ""win"" rule to link either ""baba"" with ""win"" or redefine the door as ""win."" Since the player is Baba and can be the win condition, the former is more direct. 

To execute this, the action would be to move the ""is"" block from (7,1) to the ""baba"" rule at ( -3, -5). The steps required are left 4 and down 5. But how to input this as a single action? The available actions are up, down, left, right, idle. 

Since each action is a single step, moving left four times and down five times would take multiple actions. However, the system might require a single action per turn. 

Given that, perhaps the immediate action is to move left towards the ""is"" block. But given the previous failed attempts, maybe the correct action now is to move left to position the ""is"" block correctly. 

Alternatively, since the last valid observation had the player possibly stuck, the next logical move is to try moving left again to adjust position. 

But considering the latest observation, after several left moves, the map state hasn't changed much. Maybe the correct action is to move down to reach the lower part where the ""you"" rule and other ""is"" blocks are, to potentially create a new rule from there. 

Alternatively, move the ""is"" block adjacent to ""win"" down towards the ""baba"" rule. Each move of the ""is"" block would require individual actions, but since we can only output one action per turn, the best immediate action is to move left to get closer to the ""is"" block. 

In the last observation, the player was at a position where moving left again didn't change the state, possibly because the ""is"" block is out of reach. Therefore, perhaps the correct action now is to move down to navigate to a different part of the map where.rules can be manipulated more effectively.

Let's try to figure out what the next move should be here. The active rule is still ""baba is you,"" which means I can manipulate other text blocks or move around. Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key located at 1 step to the right and 1 step up. Maybe I need that key to open a door? But the door is positioned at 1 step to the left and 3 steps down. Let me check the current position of the key again. The key is at 1 step right and 1 step up from my current position.

Wait, the current observation shows that after moving down once, the key's position hasn't changed. So if I move up from here, I can reach the key. But there's a wall 3 steps to the right and 1 step up. Hmm, but since ""baba is you,"" maybe I can push the wall or move through it? No, according to the rules, walls are defined as stop, which means I can't move through them unless a rule changes that. Let me check the active rules again. The active rule is only ""baba is you,"" so walls are still stop. 

So moving up to get the key might be blocked by the wall. Alternatively, maybe I need to move towards the door. The door is at 1 step left and 3 steps down. But there's a rule `door` 6 steps to the right and 5 steps down. Wait, the door might be a stop? Or does the door have a different property? The active rules don't mention door being anything other than a door. Usually, in Baba Is You, the door is something you need to reach, but it might require a key. The key is here, so maybe I need to grab it first.

But how to get past the walls? The walls are to the right and left. If I can create a new rule that makes the wall something else, like ""wall is stop,"" but since I'm Baba and can push text blocks, maybe I can move the 'is' rule to create a new rule. For example, if I move the 'is' block to say ""wall is stop,"" but wait, 'stop' is already a rule. Alternatively, maybe I can change 'wall' to 'you' or 'win' to make a path. 

Looking at the objects, there's a rule `is` at 2 steps to the right and 3 steps down. If I can move that 'is' block next to 'wall' or another object, I could create a new rule. For instance, moving 'is' next to 'baba' and 'win' to make ""baba is win,"" which would make Baba the win condition. That might be a way to reach the goal without dealing with the door and key. 

Alternatively, since the key is nearby, maybe I should go get it first. If I move up once, but there's a wall at 3 steps right and 1 step up. Wait, my current position isn't specified, but the objects are relative. Maybe I need to adjust my movement based on the positions. Let me try to visualize the map. It's a bit complex with multiple walls and rules scattered around. 

The key is at 1 step right and 1 step up. If I move up from my current position, I can reach the key. But the wall is 3 steps to the right and 1 step up. How does that relate to my position? Maybe I'm positioned somewhere in the middle. If I move left to get around the wall, but the 'stop' rule is at 1 step left and 1 step up, which is a wall. Hmm. 

Another approach: Since I'm Baba and can move text blocks, maybe I can move the 'is' rule nearby to create a new rule. For example, moving the 'is' at 7 steps right and 1 step up to attach to 'win' at 8 steps right and 1 step up, making ""win is [something]"". But not sure. Alternatively, move the 'is' to attach to 'baba' and 'you', making ""baba is you"" again, which is already active. 

Wait, the active rule is already ""baba is you,"" so that doesn't help. Maybe I need to create a rule that makes a path. For instance, moving 'is' next to 'wall' and 'stop', making ""wall is stop"", which is redundant because that's already a rule. Or moving 'is' to 'baba' and 'win', making ""baba is win"", which would make Baba the win condition. Then I could just move towards where Baba is (which is me) and that would be the win. 

Looking at the positions, the rule `baba` is at 3 steps left and 5 steps down. If I can create ""baba is win"" by moving the 'is' block next to 'baba' and 'win', then I can win by reaching myself. But how to get the 'is' block there? The 'is' blocks are scattered at various positions. The closest 'is' is at 6 steps right and 3 steps down, but that's to the right. Alternatively, the 'is' at 2 steps right and 3 steps down. Maybe moving that one. 

Alternatively, move the 'is' at 1 step down to be next to 'baba' and 'win'. But I need to see the exact positions. The 'baba' rule is at 2 steps left and 5 steps down, and 'win' is at 8 steps right and 1 step up. That's a bit far. Maybe another approach. 

The door is at 1 step left and 4 steps down. If I can make the door not a stop, or make myself able to pass through it. Since the door is a stop unless a rule says otherwise. If I can change the door's property, like ""door is push"" or something, but there's no 'push' rule here. Alternatively, make the door a 'win' by moving the 'is' rule next to 'door' and 'win'. 

The rule `door` is at 6 steps right and 5 steps down. The 'win' is at 8 steps right and 1 step up. So maybe moving the 'is' from 2 steps right and 3 steps down to be between 'door' and 'win', making ""door is win"". Then the door would be the win condition. Then I can move towards the door. 

But getting to that 'is' block might be tricky. Alternatively, use the existing 'is' blocks to create new rules. The key is at 1 step right and 1 step up. If I can get the key first, maybe that unlocks something. But how? The door requires the key, perhaps. If I move down to the key's location, but there's a wall in the way. 

Wait, the current position after moving down earlier is now with the key at 1 step right and 1 step up. If I move up from here, I can reach the key. Let me check if there's a path. My current position isn't specified, but the objects are relative. Let's assume I'm at the position relative to the key. If I move up once, I can get the key. Then, with the key, I can move to the door at 1 step left and 4 steps down. 

But the door is blocked by walls. The door's position is 1 step left and 4 steps down. There's a wall at 3 steps right and 4 steps down. So maybe after getting the key, I need to push the wall aside by changing its rule. For example, moving 'is' next to 'wall' and 'stop' to reinforce it, but that doesn't help. Alternatively, change 'wall' to 'push' or 'you'. 

Another idea: Since I'm Baba and can move text blocks, maybe I can create a rule that allows me to move through walls. For example, making ""wall is stop"" which is already a rule, or making ""stop is you"", which would make stops behave like you. If I can move the 'is' rule to say ""stop is you"", then I can walk through walls. 

The 'stop' rule is at 1 step left and 1 step up. There's an 'is' block at 2 steps right and 3 steps down. If I can move that 'is' to be next to 'stop' and 'you', making ""stop is you"". Then, walls (which are stop) would be you, meaning I can walk through them. That could open up a path. 

So the steps would be: Move to the 'is' block at 2 steps right and 3 steps down, then move it next to 'stop' (1 step left and 1 step up) and 'you' (1 step left and 3 steps down). Once that's done, ""stop is you"" becomes active, allowing me to walk through walls. Then I can navigate to the door or the key more easily. 

Alternatively, create ""baba is win"" to immediately win. To do that, find an 'is' block and move it next to 'baba' (3 steps left and 5 steps down) and 'win' (8 steps right and 1 step up). That's quite far, though. 

Considering the time and possible moves, maybe focusing on getting the key and then using it on the door. But the door's position is 1 step left and 4 steps down, and I need to reach it. With the key, I can open the door. However, the path might be blocked by walls. 

Alternatively, Changing the door's property to 'win' using an 'is' block. The door is at 6 steps right and 5 steps down. If I can move an 'is' block there next to 'door' and 'win', making ""door is win"". Then the door becomes the win condition. 

So moving the 'is' block from 2 steps right and 3 steps down to be next to the door and win. That would require moving left and down. 

Alternatively, the current observation shows an 'is' block at 1 step down. If I can move that 'is' block to attach to 'door' and 'win', that could work. 

But navigating to that position might be complex. Given the time I've spent and the previous failed attempts, maybe the best immediate action is to move towards the key to retrieve it, then use the key on the door. To get the key, I need to move up from my current position, but there's a wall. So perhaps I need to rearrange the rules first to remove the wall's stop property. 

Another angle: The 'key' is at 1 step right and 1 step up. If I move right once, I can reach the key. But there's a wall at 3 steps to the right and 1 step up. Wait, that wall is three steps to the right from my current position? Or is that relative to another object? This part is a bit confusing without a map layout. 

Alternatively, since the key is nearby and I need it, maybe the solution is to move up to get the key, even if there's a wall. But since walls are stop, I can't move through them. So perhaps the wall is in a different direction. 

Hmm, this is tricky. Given the previous failed attempts and the need to provide a valid action, perhaps the best bet is to move towards the key by moving up, assuming that the path is clear. Or try to move left to reach a different part of the map where rules can be manipulated. 

Alternatively, move the 'is' block to create a new rule that allows movement. For example, moving 'is' next to 'baba' and 'win' to make ""baba is win"". 

Given the time I've spent and the need to choose an action, I'll go with moving down towards the door area, hoping to reach it with the key. So the action would be down.

The current active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I can move and interact with objects as Baba. The goal is usually to reach a ""win"" object, but I need to check if that's still the case.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ""win"" rule positioned 8 steps to the right and 3 steps up. But there are walls blocking the path directly. The ""key"" is 1 step to the right and 2 steps up, which might be necessary to open a door. There's a ""door"" 1 step to the left and 2 steps down, but I don't know if it's locked or requires a key. 

The ""rule `you`"" is at 1 step to the left and 3 steps down. Since I'm Baba and ""baba is you,"" maybe I can manipulate the rules. If I can move the ""you"" text block to another object, like Baba, that might make me the ""you"" and allow me to push or interact differently. 

The ""rule `is`"" blocks are scattered. If I can move one of them to rewrite a rule, like changing ""baba is you"" to ""baba is win,"" then touching the win object would make me win. Alternatively, turning a wall into a stop or something else. 

Let me plan the steps. First, check if I can reach the key. The path to the key is blocked by walls, but maybe I can move a rule block to remove a wall. The ""rule `is`"" at 2 steps to the right and 1 step down might be movable. If I move that to somewhere else, perhaps I can clear a path. 

Alternatively, focus on manipulating the ""you"" rule. If I can move the ""you"" text block onto Baba, then ""baba is you"" becomes ""you is you,"" which might not help. Wait, no. If I make ""baba is you"" and then create ""you is win,"" then touching win would work. But how to do that? 

Looking at the map, the ""rule `is`"" at 7 steps to the right and 3 step up could be moved. If I move that ""is"" next to ""baba"" and ""you,"" I could create a new rule like ""baba is win."" But I need to move the ""is"" block. However, moving objects requires that they're not defined as ""STOP"" or similar. The current rules don't have any movement restrictions except the walls. 

So, possible actions: move left to reach the ""you"" rule, or move down to reach an ""is"" block to create a new rule. Let's say I move down to the ""is"" block at 2 steps to the right and 1 step down, pick it up, and place it next to ""baba"" and ""win"" to make ""baba is win."" Then, moving towards the win would work. 

But how to get to that ""is"" block? My current position isn't clear, but based on the observations, I need to navigate. Maybe move down twice to reach the ""is"" block at 2 steps right and 1 step down. Once I place it next to ""baba"" and ""win,"" the rule changes, and I can win. 

Alternatively, if I can get the key first, unlock the door, but the door is 1 step left and 2 steps down. To get there, need to move left and down, but there are walls. Maybe moving a wall rule to remove a block. 

Another angle: Since ""baba is you,"" I can push objects. If I can push a wall or a rule block out of the way. But the ""stop"" property makes some objects immovable. The ""stop"" rule is at 1 step left and 2 step up, so touching that would stop me. 

Wait, the key is at 1 step right and 2 step up. To get there, I need to move right, but there's a wall at 3 steps right. So maybe move the ""is"" block at 7 steps right and 3 step up to remove a wall. But that's far. 

Alternatively, focus on the ""you"" rule. If I can move the ""you"" block to Baba, making ""baba is you"" and ""you is you,"" but that doesn't help. Or move ""you"" to ""win,"" making ""win is you,"" so touching win makes me you, but I'm already you. Hmm. 

Maybe the correct approach is to create a new rule ""baba is win."" To do that, I need to move an ""is"" block next to ""baba"" and ""win."" The ""is"" block at 7 steps right and 3 step up is a candidate. If I can move that to the position between ""baba"" (which is at 4 step left and 3 steps down) and ""win"" (8 steps right and 3 step up). Wait, positions are relative. Maybe the map's layout is such that moving the ""is"" block next to ""baba"" and ""win"" would create the new rule. 

Alternatively, the ""is"" block at 1 step right and 1 step down could be moved. Let me see. My current position isn't specified in the latest observation, but based on previous steps, I might be near the ""baba"" rule at 3 steps right and 5 steps down. 

This is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to outline possible steps:

1. Move to the ""is"" block at 2 steps right and 3 steps down (from previous observations) to create a new rule.
2. Place it next to ""baba"" and ""win"" to make ""baba is win.""
3. Then, move towards the ""win"" object at 8 steps right and 3 step up.

But how to navigate there? There are walls, so maybe need to remove them by moving ""wall"" rules. For example, the ""wall"" rule at 3 step left and 2 step up can be moved to elsewhere to clear a path. 

Alternatively, since I'm Baba and can push objects, maybe push a wall block out of the way. But the ""stop"" rule might prevent that. 

Another idea: The ""key"" is nearby. If I get the key, maybe I can unlock a door. The door is 1 step left and 4 steps down. But to reach the key, I need to move right and up, but there's a wall at 3 steps right. So maybe move a wall rule to remove the wall. 

The ""rule `is`"" at 7 steps right and 1 step down could be moved to overwrite a wall. For example, moving it to the position of a wall to change its property. 

This is quite complex. The most promising route seems to be creating a new rule ""baba is win."" To do that, I need to move an ""is"" block next to ""baba"" and ""win."" Let me check the positions:

- ""baba"" rule is at 4 step left and 3 steps down (from earlier observations, but current position might differ).
- ""win"" rule is at 8 steps right and 3 step up.
- An ""is"" block is at 7 steps right and 3 step up. If I can move this ""is"" block to the position between ""baba"" and ""win,"" that would create ""baba is win.""

To move the ""is"" block at 7 steps right and 3 step up, I need to navigate there. From the current position (assuming I'm near the ""baba"" rule), moving right and up. But there are walls. Maybe move left first to get closer. 

Alternatively, use the ""is"" block at 1 step right and 1 step down. If I can move that one to the desired location. 

Given the uncertainty of my current position, I'll prioritize moving to the nearest ""is"" block to create a new rule. The ""is"" block at 2 steps right and 3 steps down (from a previous observation) might be accessible. Moving down to reach it, then placing it next to ""baba"" and ""win."" 

So, the chosen action would be to move down to reach that ""is"" block, then move it to create the desired rule. But the immediate action needed is to decide the next step. Based on the latest observation, the active rules and objects are as listed. The key is at 1 step right and 2 step up, but path blocked. The door is 1 step left and 4 steps down. The ""you"" rule is at 5 steps down. 

Wait, the current observation shows ""rule `you` 5 steps down."" If I can move that ""you"" rule onto myself (Baba), then ""baba is you"" becomes ""you is you,"" which doesn't change much. But if I can make ""baba is win,"" that's better. 

Alternatively, move the ""is"" block at 7 steps right and 3 step up to the position between ""baba"" (which is at 4 step left and 5 steps down?) and ""win"" (8 steps right and 3 step up). Hmm, positions are relative, so maybe the map is laid out in a grid where directions are relative to the player's position. 

This is getting too ambiguous. Given the time I've spent, I'll go with moving down to reach an ""is"" block and then use it to create the new rule. So the next action is down.

Let's see where I am. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I can move and interact with other objects. My goal is usually to reach a ""win"" object, which is probably the door or something similar. Looking at the map, the ""win"" rule is positioned at 8 steps to the right and 4 steps up. There are walls blocking the direct path, so I need to navigate around them.

First, I need to check where the key is. The key is at 1 step to the right and 3 steps up. Maybe I need to get the key to unlock a door? The door is at 1 step to the left and 1 step down. Hmm, but the door might be a ""stop"" or ""wall"" unless its rule has changed. Wait, the rule ""door"" is at 6 steps to the right and 2 steps down. So currently, the door's property is defined by that rule. But since ""baba is you,"" maybe I can move into the door if its rule is changed. 

Looking at the objects, there's a ""rule `baba`"" at 2 steps to the left and 5 steps down. If I can move that text block, I could change the definition of Baba. For example, if I make ""baba is win,"" then I would become the win condition. Alternatively, if I can make ""door is you,"" then stepping on the door would make me win. 

But how do I move the text blocks? The rules specify that only objects not defined as ""STOP"" or similar can be moved. Let me check which objects are stop. There's a ""rule `stop`"" at 1 step to the left and 2 step up. So any object with ""stop"" property can't be moved. The walls are defined by ""rule `wall`,"" so they're also immovable. But the ""is"" rules and other text blocks like ""key,"" ""baba,"" ""you,"" ""door"" might be movable if they don't have a stop property. 

The ""rule `baba`"" is at 2 steps to the left and 5 steps down. If I can move that text block, I could place it next to ""Baba"" to change his properties. For example, if I move ""baba is win"" next to the Baba object, then I would become win. But first, I need to locate the Baba object. Wait, the Baba object's position isn't explicitly listed here. The map shows rules but not the actual Baba entity. Wait, in Baba Is You, the Baba you control is usually a separate object on the map. Let me check the objects again. 

Looking at the current observation, the objects listed are walls, rules, key, door, and rule `baba`. Wait, maybe the actual Baba avatar is implied by the ""baba is you"" rule. So perhaps the player is represented by the Baba entity, which is located somewhere on the map. But in the given objects, there's no explicit Baba object, only the rule `baba` which defines the text block. Hmm, maybe the Baba avatar is nearby. 

Alternatively, perhaps the player is the Baba entity, and their position is inferred from the rules. Let me think. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" so the player is Baba. So I need to move the Baba (player) around to interact with other objects. 

Looking at the map, the player's current position isn't specified. But the objects are listed relative to the player's position. For example, ""wall 3 steps to the right and 4 step up"" means there's a wall three steps right and four up from where I am. Similarly, the ""rule `is`"" is seven steps to the right and four up. 

To reach the ""win"" rule at 8 steps right and 4 up, I need to move right, but there's a wall at 3 steps right and 4 up. So I can't go directly right. Maybe I need to move down to avoid the wall. Let's check the path. If I move down a few steps, perhaps I can find a way around. 

The key is at 1 step right and 3 steps up. Maybe I should go get the key first. To get there, I need to move right once and up three times, but there's a wall at 3 steps right and 4 up. Wait, the key is at 1 step right and 3 up, which is closer. So moving right once and up three steps would reach the key. But is there a wall in between? Let's see: the walls are at 3 steps right and various up positions. The key is at 1 step right and 3 up, so the path from the player's position (assumed to be at 0,0) to the key is right 1, up 3. Are there walls along that path? The walls are at 3 steps right, so the path to the key isn't blocked. 

Once I have the key, maybe I can unlock the door. The door is at 1 step left and 1 step down. But the door's rule is at 6 steps right and 2 steps down, which probably defines it as a stop or wall. So unless I change the door's rule, it's blocking the path. 

Alternatively, if I can change the ""win"" rule's position. The ""win"" rule is at 8 steps right and 4 up. If I can move that rule closer, maybe I can reach it. But to move the ""win"" rule, I need to be able to move the text block, which requires it not to be stopped. The ""win"" rule's status isn't specified here, but since it's a text block, unless there's a ""stop"" rule on it, I can move it. 

Another approach: since I'm Baba and can change rules, maybe I can make myself win. For example, if I can write ""baba is win"" by placing the ""win"" text block next to the ""baba"" text block. The ""rule `baba`"" is at 2 steps left and 5 steps down. The ""rule `win`"" is at 8 steps right and 4 up. So I need to move either the ""baba"" rule or the ""win"" rule to combine them. 

To do that, I need to navigate to where those text blocks are. The ""baba"" rule is 2 left and 5 down, which is quite far. The ""win"" rule is 8 right and 4 up. Maybe it's easier to move the ""win"" rule towards the ""baba"" rule. But moving the ""win"" rule would require going 8 steps right and 4 up, which is blocked by walls. 

Alternatively, maybe I can rearrange the ""is"" rules. There are several ""rule `is`"" blocks scattered around. For example, one is at 7 steps right and 1 step up, another at 6 steps right and 3 steps down, etc. If I can create a new rule like ""baba is win"" by combining the ""baba"" and ""win"" text blocks with an ""is"" rule. 

Let me think step by step. 

1. Current active rule: ""baba is you"" → I am Baba.
2. Goal: Reach ""win"" (probably the door or a specific win block).
3. Obstacles: Walls and possibly the door's ""stop"" property.
4. Key is available; maybe needed to unlock something.
5. Possible solutions:
   a. Move the ""win"" rule to a location I can reach.
   b. Change my own rule to ""baba is win"" by placing the appropriate text blocks.
   c. Make the door passable by changing its rule.

Starting with solution b: To make ""baba is win,"" I need to have the text blocks ""baba,"" ""is,"" and ""win"" adjacent. The ""is"" rule is available at various positions. For example, there's a ""rule `is`"" at 7 steps right and 1 step up. If I can move that ""is"" rule next to the ""baba"" rule and the ""win"" rule, I can create the new rule. 

But moving those text blocks requires navigating to their positions. The ""baba"" rule is at 2 steps left and 5 steps down, which is quite far. The ""is"" rule at 7 steps right and 1 step up is also distant. Alternatively, maybe there's a closer ""is"" rule. Let me check the objects again:

- rule `is` 6 steps to the right and 3 step up
- rule `is` 1 step to the right and 1 step down
- rule `is` 2 steps to the right and 3 steps down
- rule `is` 7 steps to the right and 4 step up
- rule `is` 2 steps to the left and 3 steps down

Wait, in the current observation, the objects include multiple ""rule `is`"" blocks at different positions. For example, one is at 7 steps right and 4 step up, another at 6 steps right and 3 step up, etc. 

If I can move one of these ""is"" rules to combine with ""baba"" and ""win,"" that would create the new rule. Let's say I want to create ""baba is win."" I need the ""baba"" text block, an ""is"" text block, and the ""win"" text block adjacent. 

The ""baba"" rule is at 2 steps left and 5 steps down. The ""win"" rule is at 8 steps right and 4 step up. The closest ""is"" rule is at 7 steps right and 4 step up. If I can move that ""is"" rule towards the ""baba"" rule, maybe I can place them adjacent. 

But moving the ""is"" rule at 7 steps right and 4 step up would require navigating to that position. From the player's current position (assuming they're at the origin), that's 7 steps right and 4 up. However, there's a wall at 3 steps right and 4 step up, blocking the path. So moving directly right 7 steps would hit the wall. 

Alternative route: Maybe move down first to avoid the wall. For instance, move down to 3 steps right and 1 step up, then right to 7 steps. But I need to check the map layout. 

Alternatively, use the ""key"" to unlock something. The key is at 1 step right and 3 step up. If I pick up the key (by moving right and up), then use it on the door. But the door's rule is at 6 steps right and 2 steps down. If the door is defined as ""stop,"" then having the key might not help unless there's a rule like ""key unlock door."" But there's no such rule mentioned here. 

Another angle: The ""rule `you`"" is at 1 step left and 5 steps down. If I can make ""you"" something else, like ""door,"" then stepping on the door would make me win. To do that, I need to create a rule like ""you is door."" The ""you"" text block is at 1 left and 5 down, ""is"" is available at various spots, and ""door"" is at 6 right and 5 down. So if I can move ""is"" next to ""you"" and ""door,"" that could work. 

But to move the ""you"" or ""door"" text blocks, they must not be stopped. The ""you"" rule is at 1 left and 5 down; unless there's a ""stop"" on it, I can move it. 

So possible steps:
1. Move to the ""you"" rule at 1 left and 5 down.
2. Move an ""is"" rule next to it.
3. Move the ""door"" rule (at 6 right and 5 down) next to the ""is"" rule.
4. This would create ""you is door,"" meaning whatever is ""you"" (which is Baba) would become door, and since door is win, that would make me win.

But how to get to those positions? The player's current position is unknown, but the objects are listed relative to the player. Let's assume the player is at position (0,0). 

The ""you"" rule is at (-1, -5) (1 step left and 5 steps down). The ""is"" rules are at various positions, like (7,4), (6,3), (2, -1), etc. The ""door"" rule is at (6, -5). 

To reach the ""you"" rule at (-1, -5), the player would need to move left once and down five times. Along the way, are there walls? Let's see:

- At (3,4): wall
- At (3,3): wall
- At (3,2): wall
- At (3,1): wall
- At (3,0): wall
- At (3,-1): wall
- etc.

So moving down from the player's position (assuming they're north of the walls) would be blocked by walls starting at (3,4) down. Therefore, moving left and down directly isn't possible due to walls. 

Alternative path: Maybe move around the walls. For example, move right to get past the walls, then down. Let's see. 

If the player is at (0,0), and the walls are at (3,4) and below, perhaps the player is to the left of the walls. To get to the ""you"" rule at (-1,-5), they need to move left and down, but the path is blocked by walls starting at (3, y). Wait, maybe the walls are on the right side. For example, walls at 3 steps right and various up/down positions. So the player is likely on the left side of the map, and the right side has walls blocking the path. 

In that case, moving left and down towards the ""you"" rule might be possible if there are no walls in that direction. The ""you"" rule is at (-1,-5), so left 1, down 5. Are there walls there? The observation shows walls at 3 steps right, but not on the left. So maybe the path is clear. 

But I need to confirm. The listed walls are all on the right side (steps to the right), so moving left should be possible. 

So the plan could be:
1. Move left once to reach the ""you"" rule's x-coordinate.
2. Move down five steps to reach the ""you"" rule's position.
3. Once there, move an ""is"" rule next to it.
4. Then move the ""door"" rule next to the ""is"" rule to create ""you is door.""

But how to move the ""is"" and ""door"" rules? They need to be adjacent. 

Alternatively, pick up an ""is"" rule that's closer. For example, the ""rule `is`"" at 2 steps to the right and 1 step down (position (2,-1)). If I can move that ""is"" rule to the left to be near the ""you"" rule. 

To move the ""is"" rule at (2,-1), I need to go there, pick it up (since it's not a stop), and carry it to the ""you"" rule at (-1,-5). That would require moving left 3 steps and down 4 steps. But along the way, are there walls? The player's path would be from (0,0) to (2,-1): right 2, down 1. No walls mentioned in that area. Then from (2,-1) to (-1,-5): left 3, down 4. Again, no walls reported in those directions, as all walls are on the right side at 3 steps right. 

Once the ""is"" rule is at (-1,-5) next to the ""you"" rule, placing the ""door"" rule (which is at (6,-5)) next to them would require moving the ""door"" rule left 7 steps. But the ""door"" rule is at (6,-5), so moving it left to (-1,-5) would need to pass through (5,-5), (4,-5), etc., which are likely clear since there are no walls mentioned there. 

However, the ""door"" rule is a text block, and unless it's stopped, it can be moved. The ""door"" rule's property isn't specified as stop, so it should be movable. 

This seems complicated, but doable. 

Alternatively, another approach: Make the door a ""win"" by creating a rule ""door is win."" The ""door"" rule is at (6,-5), and the ""win"" rule is at (8,4). To do this, I need to move ""is"" between ""door"" and ""win."" 

The ""is"" rule at (7,4) is close to the ""win"" rule. If I can move that ""is"" rule down to (6,-5) next to ""door"" and ""win,"" but that's a long move. 

Alternatively, use an ""is"" rule that's closer. For example, the ""is"" at (2,-1). Move that ""is"" rule to (6,-5) next to ""door,"" then move the ""win"" rule to (7,-5) to create ""door is win."" 

But again, moving the ""win"" rule from (8,4) to (7,-5) would require bypassing walls. 

This is getting quite involved. Maybe the simplest way is to focus on creating ""baba is win"" by getting the ""baba"" rule, ""is,"" and ""win"" together. 

The ""baba"" rule is at (-2,-5). The ""win"" rule is at (8,4). The closest ""is"" rule is at (7,4). If I can move that ""is"" rule to (-2,-5), next to ""baba"" and ""win,"" but that's a huge distance. 

Alternatively, use a different ""is"" rule. The ""is"" at (6,3) is at (6,3). If I move that down to (-2,-5), that's moving left 8 and down 8, which is impossible due to walls. 

Perhaps this approach isn't feasible. 

Another idea: Since I'm Baba and can push certain objects, maybe I can push the ""win"" rule towards me. But the ""win"" rule is at (8,4), which is far to the right. The player would need to move right past the walls, but there's a wall at (3,4) and below, blocking that path. 

Wait, the walls are at 3 steps right and various up/down positions. So the player can't move right past 3 steps because of the walls. Therefore, the ""win"" rule at (8,4) is unreachable directly.

Let's try to figure out the next move here. I'm in Baba Is You, and the goal is usually to reach the WIN object, but I know the rules can change. Let's look at the current active rules.

The active rule is ""baba is you"". That means whatever I do, I can potentially move or manipulate the text blocks since I'm Baba. The objects on the map include walls, a key, a door, and some rules scattered around.

The key is at 1 step to the right and 3 steps up. The door is at 1 step to the left and 1 step down. The ""you"" rule is at 2 steps down, left of Baba's position. The ""win"" rule is all the way to the right at 8 steps right and 4 steps up. But there are walls blocking the direct path.

First, I need to see if I can reach the ""you"" rule to make myself the YOU, so I can push other objects. But the ""you"" is under a ""stop"" rule at 1 step left and 3 steps up. Wait, no, the ""stop"" is at 1 step left and 3 steps up, same as the key. The ""you"" rule is at 2 steps down, left of Baba. So maybe moving down towards the ""you"" rule?

Looking at the map, to get to the ""you"" rule, which is 2 steps down, left of Baba's position, I need to move down once, then left. But are there any STOP objects blocking the way? The wall is at 3 steps right, but I'm probably on the left side. Let me check the path.

If I move down from my current position, there's a wall 3 steps to the right and 1 step up. Wait, maybe I'm positioned somewhere in the middle. The ""rule `is`"" is at 2 steps to the right, which might be a movable text block. Since I'm Baba and ""baba is you"", I can move any text block that's not STOP. The STOP is at 1 step left and 3 steps up, so that's a wall with STOP property, which I can't move.

So the plan is: move towards the ""you"" rule at 1 step left and 2 steps down. To get there, I need to go left once and down once. But the way down might be blocked by walls. Let me check the objects around.

Looking at the objects: there's a rule `is` at 2 steps to the right. If I can move that, maybe I can rearrange the rules. Alternatively, maybe moving left first to reach the ""you"" rule. Let me see the positions again.

The ""you"" rule is located at 1 step to the left and 2 steps down. So from my current position, moving left once would get me to the same horizontal level as the ""you"" rule, then down two steps. But I need to check if there are any walls in between.

The wall is at 3 steps to the right and various positions, but since I'm moving left, the walls on the right shouldn't block me. The STOP is at 1 step left and 3 steps up, which is above the ""you"" rule. So moving left and down should be possible if there's no wall in the way.

Alternatively, maybe the key is nearby. The key is at 1 step right and 3 steps up. If I can get to the key, maybe I can use it to open a door. But the door is at 1 step left and 1 step down, which is close. However, to get to the key, I'd have to move right and up, but there are walls blocking those paths. The walls are at 3 steps right and various ups, so moving right towards the key might hit a wall.

Another approach: since ""baba is you"", I can pick up the ""rule `is`"" text block at 2 steps to the right and rearrange it. For example, moving ""is"" next to ""baba"" to create a new rule like ""baba is win"", making Baba the WIN object. That could let me push past walls or directly reach the WIN zone.

But to do that, I need to move the ""is"" text block. Let's see its position: 2 steps to the right. So if I move right twice, I can grab the ""is"" block. Then move it left to combine with ""baba"". The ""baba"" rule is at 2 steps left and 5 steps down. Wait, no, looking back, the ""rule `baba`"" is at 3 steps left and 5 steps down. So from my current position, moving left multiple times and down to reach the ""baba"" rule.

But that might be complicated. Alternatively, create ""you is baba"" by moving the ""is"" next to ""you"". The ""you"" is at 1 step left and 5 steps down. So moving left and down, then placing ""is"" between ""you"" and ""baba"" would make ""you is baba"", making Baba the YOU, allowing me to push objects.

But navigating to that position might be tough. Let's recap:

Current active rule: baba is you.

Possible actions:

1. Move towards ""you"" rule to make myself YOU, enabling pushing.
2. Move ""is"" rule to create new rules like ""baba is win"" or ""you is baba"".
3. Try to reach the key and door combination, but likely blocked by walls.

Given the walls, option 1 or 2 seems better. Let's try option 1 first.

The ""you"" rule is at 1 step left and 2 steps down. From my current position, moving left once gets to the same horizontal level as ""you"", then down two steps. Let's check if the path is clear.

Looking at the objects below: at 1 step down, there's a wall 3 steps to the right. But if I'm moving left, the wall is on the right, so shouldn't block. Then at 2 steps down, there's a wall at 3 steps to the right and 2 steps down, but again, moving left, that's on the right. So moving left and down should be possible.

So the sequence would be: left, down, down. But first, I need to confirm my current position. The observation shows various walls and rules relative to my position. For example, ""wall 3 steps to the right and 4 step up"" implies I'm somewhere to the left of that wall. The ""rule `is`"" at 7 steps right and 4 steps up is even further right.

Wait, maybe I'm positioned at the origin point, and all other objects are relative to me. So ""3 steps to the right"" would be my right side. So my current position is central, and objects are placed around me.

In that case, to reach the ""you"" rule at 1 step left and 2 steps down, I need to move left once, then down twice. Let's check if there are any STOP objects in between. The ""stop"" rule is at 1 step left and 3 steps up, which is above the ""you"" location. So moving down from there won't hit a STOP.

Therefore, the valid action would be to move left first, then down. But the previous attempts had the system failing, maybe due to incorrect directions. Let me check the last few observations.

In the last observation, after moving down multiple times, the active rules are still ""baba is you"", and the ""you"" rule is at 1 step left and 2 steps down. So the correct path is left then down twice.

But the system kept failing when I tried 'left' multiple times. Maybe the agent needs to move step by step. Let's try left once first.

The current active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I can move around and manipulate text blocks. The goal is usually to reach a ""win"" object, but I should check if that's still the case here.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ""win"" rule located at 9 steps to the right and 4 steps up. But there are walls blocking that path. Also, there's a ""door"" at 1 step down, which might need a key. There's a key at 2 steps to the right and 3 steps up. Maybe I need to get that key first.

Wait, but how do I get past the walls? The walls are defined by ""wall"" rules. Since I'm Baba and ""baba is you,"" maybe I can push the walls if they aren't stopped. But the rules also mention ""stop"" at 3 steps up. Hmm, not sure. Maybe I can move the ""is"" text blocks to change the rules.

Looking at the positions, the ""is"" rule is at 8 steps to the right and 4 steps up. If I can move that ""is"" somewhere else, maybe I can combine it with other text blocks to create new rules. For example, if I can make ""baba is win,"" then touching Baba would make him a win. Or maybe ""key is push"" so I can move the key.

But how to get to the ""is"" block? There are walls to the right. Maybe I need to move left to reach it. The ""rule `is`"" is at 3 steps to the right. Wait, the current observation says ""rule `is` 3 steps to the right."" So if I move left from my current position, I can reach that ""is"" block. Once there, I can pick it up and move it to combine with other blocks, like ""baba"" and ""win"" to make ""baba is win.""

Alternatively, the ""you"" rule is at 1 step to the right and 2 steps down. Maybe if I can attach ""you"" to ""baba,"" but I already am ""baba is you,"" so that's redundant. Maybe the key is needed to open the door. Let me check the door location: 1 step down. If I have the key, I can move the door rule to change its behavior.

But first, I need to get the key. The key is at 2 steps right and 3 steps up. From my current position, which is not specified, but looking at the objects, maybe I'm at the starting point. Wait, the initial position isn't clear here. Let me assume I'm at Baba's location, which is at ""rule `baba` 1 step to the left and 2 steps down."" So my position is 1 step to the left and 2 steps down.

To get the key at 2 steps right and 3 steps up, I need to move right twice and up three times. But there's a wall at 4 steps right and 1 step up. Wait, the walls are spread out. Let me map this out.

Current position: Baba is at 1 step left and 2 steps down.

Key location: 2 steps right, 3 steps up from Baba's position. So from Baba's position, moving right 2, up 3 would reach the key. But are there walls in between? Let's see:

- Moving right once gets me to.rule `baba` is at 1 step left and 2 steps down. Wait, no, the rule `baba` is at 1 step to the left and 2 steps down relative to where? Maybe the coordinate system is from Baba's position. This is getting a bit confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the absolute positions are relative to the starting point.

Alternatively, maybe the key is located 2 steps to the right and 3 steps up from the current Baba's position. Let's think step by step.

If I need to get to the key at 2 steps right and 3 steps up, my current position is 1 step left and 2 steps down (rule `baba` is there). So to reach the key, I need to move right by 3 steps (since 1 step left to get to center, then 2 more right) and up by 3 steps. But there might be walls blocking the path.

Looking at the walls:

- wall 4 steps to the right and 4 step up: That's a wall far to the right and up high.

- wall 4 steps to the right and 3 step up: Another wall.

- wall 4 steps to the right and 2 step up: Another wall.

- wall 4 steps to the right and 1 step up: And another.

- wall 4 steps to the right: Directly to the right.

So moving right from Baba's position (1 left, 2 down) would first go through 0 steps right, then 1, 2, 3, 4. But the walls at 4 steps right in various up positions suggest that moving right past 4 steps is blocked. But the key is at 2 steps right and 3 steps up. So the path might be:

From Baba's position (1 left, 2 down):

1. Move right to center (0 steps right).

2. Move right again to 1 step right.

3. Up to 1 step up.

But there's a wall at 4 steps right and 1 step up, but that's further right. So maybe moving up from 1 step right is possible.

Wait, the walls at 4 steps right are in various up positions, but the key is at 2 steps right and 3 steps up. So the path could be right to 2 steps, up to 3 steps. Are there walls in between?

At 2 steps right, the walls are not listed except for the ones at 4 steps right. So maybe it's possible. Alternatively, maybe there's a stop rule at 3 steps up. The ""stop"" rule is at 3 step up, but where? The observation says ""rule `stop` 3 step up."" So if ""stop"" is an object, it's at 3 steps up, but in which direction? The exact position isn't clear. Maybe it's on the path.

Alternatively, since ""stop"" is a property, objects with ""stop"" can't be moved. So if there's a wall or another object with ""stop"" property in the way, I can't push past it.

This is getting complicated. Maybe a better approach is to manipulate the rules. The ""is"" rule is at 3 steps to the right. If I can move that ""is"" to combine with ""baba"" and ""win,"" creating ""baba is win,"" then touching Baba would make him win.

To do that, I need to move the ""is"" block from 3 steps right to be next to ""baba"" and ""win."" The ""baba"" rule is at 1 step left and 2 steps down, and ""win"" is at 9 steps right and 4 steps up. That's quite far, but maybe I can move the ""is"" block step by step.

Alternatively, create a rule like ""you is win"" so that if I become you (which I already am), then I win. But I'm already ""baba is you,"" so maybe that's redundant.

Alternatively, make ""key is push"" so I can move the key. Then get the key, use it on the door.

The door is at 1 step down. If I have the key, maybe I can push the door rule. But the door's current rule is ""rule `door` 7 steps to the right and 2 steps down."" To change the door's behavior, I need to create a ""door is key"" or something, but I need the key first.

Hmm. Let's outline possible steps:

1. Get the key at 2 steps right, 3 steps up.

   - Move right 2, up 3. Check for obstacles.

2. Use the key on the door at 1 step down.

   - If ""door is key,"" then using the key would open it.

3. Alternatively, change the ""win"" rule to be Baba.

   - Move ""is"" to create ""baba is win.""

But moving the ""is"" block requires being able to move it. Since I'm ""baba is you,"" and assuming ""you"" can move non-stop objects, I can pick up the ""is"" block if it's not stopped.

The ""is"" block is at 3 steps to the right. From my current position (1 step left, 2 down), moving right 4 steps would get to the ""is"" block. But there are walls at 4 steps right in various up positions. So maybe the path is blocked.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" block step by step around the walls. For example, move right to 3 steps, then up, then right again, etc., but need to avoid walls.

This is getting quite involved. Let's try to prioritize. The immediate goal is either to reach the win condition by changing rules or to get the key and use it on the door.

Since the key is closer relatively, perhaps fetch the key first.

To get the key:

From Baba's position (1 left, 2 down):

- Move right to 0 steps right.

- Then right again to 1 step right.

- Then up once to 1 step up.

- Then right to 2 steps right (key's x-coordinate).

- Then up twice more to 3 steps up.

But need to check if there are walls in between.

Looking at the walls:

- At 4 steps right and various up positions, but I'm only moving to 2 steps right, so no walls there.

- The ""stop"" rule is at 3 step up, but not sure where. If it's an object, maybe it's at 3 steps up in some direction. If it's a property of an object, like a wall, then that wall can't be moved.

Assuming that moving right and up to the key is possible, I can pick up the key.

Once I have the key, I can move to the door at 1 step down. The door's rule is at 7 steps right and 2 steps down. To interact with the door, maybe I need to be adjacent to it. If I have the key, I can create a rule like ""door is key"" to open it.

Alternatively, move the key to the door's location and then create a rule.

But this requires more steps. Alternatively, after getting the key, move to the door and use the key there.

Alternatively, change the ""win"" rule to be Baba by moving the ""is"" block next to ""baba"" and ""win.""

The ""win"" rule is at 9 steps right and 4 steps up. That's far away, but if I can move the ""is"" block there, combining with ""baba"" and ""win,"" then touching Baba would make him win.

But moving the ""is"" block all the way to 9 steps right would require overcoming multiple walls. Maybe not feasible.

Another approach: Make ""baba is win"" by moving ""is"" between ""baba"" and ""win.""

The ""baba"" rule is at 1 step left and 2 steps down. The ""win"" rule is at 9 steps right and 4 steps up. The ""is"" rule is at 3 steps right. To create ""baba is win,"" I need to move ""is"" from 3 right to between ""baba"" and ""win.""

But the distance is too great. Maybe instead, create a local rule near Baba. For example, move ""is"" next to ""baba"" and ""win"" in close proximity.

Alternatively, use the key to open a door that leads near the win area.

This is quite challenging. Let me try to outline a step-by-step plan:

1. Move to the key's location (2 right, 3 up) to retrieve it.

   - Actions: right, right, up, up, up.

2. Use the key to interact with the door at 1 step down.

   - To do this, maybe create a rule like ""door is key"" so that using the key on the door opens it.

3. Once through the door, reach the win area.

Alternatively, if the door isn't needed, perhaps the win condition is elsewhere.

Alternatively, manipulate the rules to make Baba the win.

Given the time I've spent, I think the most feasible immediate action is to move towards the key to retrieve it. So the next action would be to move right twice and up three times, but I need to check if that's possible.

But in the current observation, after several ups and lefts, the position of the agent (Baba) might have changed. The latest observation shows that after moving down, the agent is now at ""wall 3 steps to the right and 4 step up,"" but I'm not entirely sure of the exact coordinates.

Alternatively, since the ""is"" rule is at 3 steps to the right, and the ""baba"" rule is at 1 step left and 2 steps down, perhaps moving left towards the ""is"" block would be better to create a new rule.

If I can pick up the ""is"" block and move it next to ""baba"" and ""win,"" that would create ""baba is win.""

So the plan is:

- Move left to reach the ""is"" block at 3 steps right (from current position, which is after several moves, maybe I need to adjust).

Wait, in the latest observation before the final one, the agent was at ""rule `baba` 2 step to the left and 5 steps down"" after moving left. Then, the current observation shows Baba at ""rule `baba` 1 step to the left and 2 steps down,"" which might be after moving up.

This is getting too confusing without a clear map. Perhaps the best action now is to move left towards the ""is"" block at 3 steps right. Wait, if the ""is"" block is at 3 steps to the right, and I'm at 1 step left, moving right 4 steps would get to it. But there's a wall at 4 steps right, so maybe not.

Alternatively, move right once to get to 0 steps right, then right again to 1, then up, etc., avoiding walls.

But given the time I've spent and the need to provide an action, I'll go with moving left to reach the ""is"" block and then manipulate the rules.

Let me try to figure out what to do here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I can manipulate the rules or move around. The goal is usually to reach the ""win"" object, but I need to check if that's still the case.

Looking at the objects, there's a door labeled ""door"" at 1 step to the right and 1 step down. Then, further down, there's a rule ""baba"" at 2 steps down, followed by ""is"" at 1 step to the right and 2 steps down, and ""you"" at 2 steps to the right and 2 steps down. So maybe combining those to make ""baba is you"" again? Wait, but the current active rule is already ""baba is you,"" so that's redundant. Maybe the real goal is different now. 

I see a ""win"" rule way to the right at 10 steps right and 4 steps up. But there are walls blocking the path. The key is at 3 steps right and 3 steps up. Maybe I need to get the key first? But how? The key is behind some walls. Wait, are the walls movable? The rules say ""rule `wall` 3 step up"" and others. Since ""wall"" is a property, and unless there's a rule that makes them movable, they're probably stopping me.

Looking at the rules, there's a ""stop"" at 1 step right and 3 steps up. So any object with ""stop"" can't be moved through. The key is at 3 steps right and 3 steps up, which is next to a wall. Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to change the property of something. For example, if I can make a wall into a ""stop"" or remove a ""stop"" property, that might help.

Wait, the current rules include ""rule `baba` 2 steps down"" and ""rule `you` 2 steps to the right and 2 steps down."" If I can combine these with the ""is"" rule at 1 step right and 2 steps down, maybe I can form a new rule like ""baba is you"" again or ""you is win."" But I'm already ""baba is you,"" so maybe changing ""win"" to something else? Like making ""win"" a different object.

Alternatively, maybe the door is the win condition. The original win is the text block at 10 steps right and 4 up, but if I can change the win condition to the door, then going to the door would be the solution. To do that, I need to move the ""win"" rule to where the door is. The door is at 1 step right and 1 step down. So if I can move the ""win"" block there, then stepping on the door would make me win.

But how do I move the ""win"" rule? The only movable objects are those not defined as ""stop"" or similar. The ""is"" rules are movable because they don't have a ""stop"" property. So I need to find an ""is"" rule that's not stopped and move it to attach to ""win"" and the door. Let's see, there's an ""is"" rule at 4 steps right (same level as the wall 5 steps right), and another at 1 step right and 2 steps down. 

If I can move the ""win"" rule (at 10 right, 4 up) down to where the door is (1 right, 1 down), I need to carry the ""win"" text block. But moving it would require moving it step by step, possibly using other ""is"" rules to reposition. However, the path is blocked by walls. The walls are at 5 steps right across various levels. Maybe there's a way to push the walls if they're not stopped, but since they have ""wall"" property, and ""wall"" is likely a stop, I can't move them.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule that makes the door the win condition. For example, if I can write ""door is win"" by moving the ""is"" rule next to ""door"" and ""win."" But the current ""win"" is separate. Let me check the positions:

- ""win"" is at 10 right, 4 up.
- ""door"" is at 1 right, 1 down.
- There's an ""is"" rule at 1 right, 2 down. If I can move the ""door"" rule (which is at 8 right, 2 down) closer to the ""win"" rule. Wait, the ""door"" rule is at 6 steps right and 5 steps down initially, but in the latest observation, the door rule is at 8 steps right and 2 steps down. Hmm, maybe the positions change as I move.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the ""you"" rule to become the door. If I can make ""you"" into ""door,"" then stepping on the door would make me you, and since I'm baba, maybe that's not helpful. Wait, no. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" so I am baba. If I can change ""you"" to ""door,"" then maybe ""baba is door,"" and then touching the door would win. But I need to form the rule ""door is win"" to make the door the win condition.

So the steps could be:

1. Move the ""is"" rule next to ""door"" and ""win"" to create ""door is win.""
2. Then go to the door, which would be the new win condition.

But how to move the ""is"" rule? Let's see the current objects:

- ""is"" is at 4 steps right (same level as the wall at 5 steps right) and at 1 step right and 2 steps down.

If I move the ""is"" at 4 steps right down to 1 step right and 2 steps down, then I can attach it to ""door"" (which is at 8 steps right and 2 steps down) and ""win"" (at 10 steps right and 4 steps up). Wait, that's not adjacent. Maybe I need to get the ""is"" rule to the area of the door.

Alternatively, the ""is"" at 1 step right and 2 steps down is near the ""you"" rule. If I can combine ""door is you"" or something, but I'm not sure. 

Another approach: Since I'm Baba and I can move, maybe I need to reach the ""win"" rule and change it. But the ""win"" is way to the right, blocked by walls. Unless I can push the walls by changing their properties. For example, if I can make a wall into a 'stop' or remove the 'wall' property, but I don't see a way to do that with the current rules.

Wait, there's a ""rule `wall` 3 step up"" which might define that a certain object is a wall. If I can move that ""wall"" rule away, then maybe the object it's applied to stops being a wall. But moving that rule would require carrying it, which might be possible.

Alternatively, if I can create a new rule that overrides the existing ""wall"" properties. For example, ""rock is not wall"" or something, but I don't see a rock mentioned here.

Alternatively, maybe the key is necessary to unlock something, but there's no lock mentioned. The key is at 3 steps right and 3 steps up, behind a wall. If I could move that wall, but it's a wall, so probably can't.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at 1 step right and 3 steps up. So anything with 'stop' can't be moved through. The key is at 3 steps right and 3 steps up, which is two steps right from the ""stop"" rule. Maybe I can move past the stop by changing the stop property. But how?

Alternatively, since I'm Baba and I can be pushed if I'm 'you', but the current rule is ""baba is you,"" so touching a 'stop' would block me. So I need to avoid stops.

Looking at the current position, I'm not sure where I am exactly. The observations show various objects but no player position. Maybe I need to assume my position is somewhere in the map. Let's try to visualize:

The map has walls spread out to the right and down. The ""win"" is far to the right and up. The door is down to the left. The ""is"" rules are scattered. To reach the door, which is at 1 step right and 1 down, I need to move left and down. But the path might be blocked by walls.

If I move left from my current position, but I don't know where I am. Maybe I should look for the 'baba' rule. There's a ""rule `baba` 2 steps down"" and ""rule `is` 1 step to the right and 2 steps down"", and ""rule `you` 2 steps to the right and 2 steps down"". So combining these could form ""baba is you you""? Probably not. Wait, the existing rule is ""baba is you,"" so maybe those other rules are nearby to be rearranged.

If I can take the ""is"" rule at 1 step right and 2 steps down and attach it to ""door"" and ""win"" to make ""door is win,"" then going to the door would win. To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule from 1 right, 2 down to be next to ""door"" (8 right, 2 down) and ""win"" (10 right, 4 up). That seems difficult because they are not adjacent.

Alternatively, maybe create ""you is door"" so that when I (being you) touch the door, I win. But I'm currently baba with the 'you' rule, so maybe that's redundant. 

Wait, the active rule is ""baba is you,"" meaning I am you. So if I can make ""you is win,"" then stepping on anything that is win would work. But where is the win object? It's at 10 right, 4 up. But I can't reach it. Alternatively, make the door the win.

Another idea: Use the ""key"" to get somewhere. The key is at 3 right, 3 up. If I could move the key, maybe unlock a door, but there's no lock mentioned. So maybe the key is a red herring.

Let me think about the rules again. The key is an object, and there's a ""rule `key` 7 steps to the right"" which might mean that the key at 7 right is defined by that rule. If I can move that ""key"" rule to the actual key's position, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the solution is to push a wall out of the way. For example, if a wall is defined by a ""wall"" rule, moving that rule away would make the object no longer a wall. So if I can take the ""rule `wall` 3 step up"" and move it somewhere else, then the corresponding wall might become passable.

The ""wall `wall` 3 step up"" – wait, no, the rule is ""rule `wall` 3 step up"", which means that the object at 3 steps up is a wall. So if I move that rule away, the object stops being a wall. But to move the rule, I need to pick it up, which is possible if it's not a stop. Since the rule itself isn't a stop, I should be able to move it.

So the plan could be:

1. Move the ""rule `wall` 3 step up"" to another position, say next to it, so that the original wall is no longer defined as a wall.
2. Then, navigate through the now-passable wall to reach the key or the win condition.

But how to execute this? Let's see the current objects related to walls:

- ""wall 3 steps to the right and 1 step up""
- ""rule `wall` 3 step up"" (position not specified, but likely at the origin?)

Wait, the observations list objects with their positions relative to the player. For example, ""wall 3 steps to the right and 1 step up"" means there's a wall 3 right, 1 up from the player. Similarly, ""rule `wall` 3 step up"" is a text block 3 up from the player.

So the player is somewhere in the map, and all objects are positioned relative to the player. The ""wall 3 steps to the right and 1 step up"" is diagonally up and right from the player. The ""rule `wall` 3 step up"" is directly above the player.

If I can move the ""rule `wall` 3 step up"" text block, then the wall it's defining (at 3 right, 1 up) would no longer be a wall. Let's say I move that ""wall"" rule to the left, so it's now at, say, 1 step left, 3 step up. Then the original wall at 3 right, 1 up would no longer be a wall, making it passable.

To move the ""rule `wall` 3 step up"" text block, I need to use the ""is"" rules to drag it. The ""is"" rules are at 4 steps right and at 1 step right and 2 steps down.

So the steps would be:

1. Move the ""is"" rule at 4 steps right to the position of the ""wall"" rule (3 up).
2. Attach the ""is"" rule to the ""wall"" rule and the new position, creating a new rule like ""wall [new position] is something"".

Wait, no. The way Baba Is You works, you move a text block next to two other text blocks to create a new rule. For example, moving ""is"" between ""baba"" and ""you"" creates ""baba is you"".

So to redefine the wall rule, I need to move the ""wall"" rule and the ""is"" rule to form a new rule. For example, if I want to remove the ""wall"" property from an object, I could create a rule like ""rock is not wall"", but I don't have a rock.

Alternatively, if I can create a rule that says ""wall is stop"", but that might not help. Alternatively, move the existing ""wall"" rule away so it's no longer applying to the object.

Wait, the existing ""rule `wall` 3 step up"" is defining that the object at 3 step up is a wall. If I move that rule to a different location, say 4 step up, then the wall at 3 step up is no longer defined as a wall by that rule, but there might be another rule defining it as a wall elsewhere. Looking at the objects, there's also ""wall 3 steps to the right and 1 step up"", which is a wall object. So maybe the ""rule `wall` 3 step up"" is what makes that wall object a wall. If I move that rule, the wall might still exist but not have the 'wall' property, making it passable.

So the plan is:

- Move the ""rule `wall` 3 step up"" text block to a different position, say 1 step left and 3 step up, by using the ""is"" rules to drag it.
- Then, navigate through the previously blocked wall to reach the key or the win condition.

But how to do that action-wise? The available actions are up, down, left, right, idle. So I need to move the ""rule `wall` 3 step up"" by adjacent steps using the ""is"" rule.

Assuming the player is at the origin (0,0), the ""rule `wall` 3 step up"" is at (0,3). The ""is"" rule at 4 steps right is at (4,0), and another ""is"" at (1, -2).

To move the ""wall"" rule up, I need to get the ""is"" rule next to it and move it. For example, move left to (0,3), then use the ""is"" at (4,0) to drag it. Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe the easiest way is to move the ""is"" rule to the ""wall"" rule's position and then move the ""wall"" rule in the desired direction.

Alternatively, since the actions are just moving the player, not the text blocks, maybe I need to be next to the text block I want to move and then move in a direction to carry it. But in Baba Is You, you can only move objects that are not 'stop'. The 'is' rules are movable, so if I can get next to the ""rule `wall` 3 step up"" and then move in a direction, maybe I can carry it.

For example, if I move up to be next to the ""rule `wall` 3 step up"" (which is at (0,3)), then move right, perhaps I can carry it. But I'm not sure. The exact mechanics of moving text blocks depend on being adjacent and then moving in a direction to carry them.

Given that the player's actions are limited to moving themselves, not the text blocks directly, the challenge is to position the player such that they can move the needed text blocks into place.

In the current observation, the ""rule `wall` 3 step up"" is at 3 step up. To move it, I might need to be adjacent to it and then move in a direction. Suppose I move up twice to get to (0,2), then up again to (0,3) where the ""wall"" rule is. Then, if I move right, maybe I can carry the ""wall"" rule to the right. But I'm not certain. The game's mechanics might require that to move a text block, you have to be adjacent to it and then move in a direction, which would move the text block one step in that direction as well.

If I can move the ""wall"" rule to the left, say to ( -1, 3), then the original wall at (0,3) would no longer be defined as a wall by that rule, making it passable. Then I could move through it to reach the key or other objects.

So the step-by-step action plan would be:

1. Move up to reach the ""rule `wall` 3 step up"" text block.
2. Move left while carrying the text block to reposition it.

But how many steps would that take? Let's see:

The ""wall"" rule is 3 steps up. If I move up three times, I reach it. Then, if I can move left while carrying it, each move action would move both the player and the text block one step left. So moving left once would place the text block at 2 steps left and 3 steps up.

Repeating this, I could move the ""wall"" rule further left, say to 1 step left and 3 steps up, then 0 steps left (origin) and 3 steps up. But the goal is to get it away from the original wall's","

Let's try to figure out what to do here. The active rule is still ""baba is you,"" which means I can move around and interact with things. The goal is usually to reach something labeled ""win,"" but I need to check where that is.

Looking at the objects on the map, the ""win"" rule is positioned at 10 steps to the right and 4 steps up. That's pretty far to the right. There's also a key at 3 steps right and 3 up. Maybe I need to get the key first to unlock something? But how?

The door is at 1 step right and 1 step down. Wait, there's a rule ""door"" at 8 steps right and 2 steps down. But doors are usually something you can walk through if you have the key. However, the key is at 3 right and 3 up. So maybe I need to move to the key's location first.

But right now, I'm probably starting at Baba's position. Let me check where Baba is. There's a rule ""baba"" at 2 steps down. So Baba is located at 2 steps down from my current position. The ""you"" rule is also at 2 steps to the right and 2 steps down. Wait, does that mean that the ""you"" is attached to Baba? Since ""baba is you,"" that would make sense. So I'm controlling Baba.

My current position is probably where the ""baba"" rule is, which is 2 steps down. The key is at 3 right and 3 up. So from my position (2 down), I need to move up 3 steps and right 3 steps. But there are walls blocking the way. Let's see the walls:

- Wall at 5 steps right and various up positions. So to the right, there are walls starting from 5 steps right up to 4 steps up. That blocks my path to the right. Maybe I need to move up first, then left?

Alternatively, maybe I can manipulate the rules. The ""is"" rules are scattered around. For example, there's an ""is"" at 4 steps right. If I can move that ""is"" somewhere else, maybe I can create a new rule. Like, if I move ""is"" next to ""baba"" and ""win,"" I could make ""baba is win"" which would make Baba the win condition. That might be a quicker way.

But how do I move the ""is"" text block? The rules say I can only move objects that aren't ""STOP"" or similar. Looking at the active rules, ""stop"" is at 1 step right and 3 step up. So any object with ""stop"" property can't be moved. But the ""is"" blocks seem movable unless they're part of a ""stop"" rule.

The ""is"" at 4 steps right is likely movable. If I move that ""is"" next to ""baba"" (which is at 2 steps down), then I can create a new rule like ""baba is win"" by placing ""win"" next to it. Wait, the ""win"" rule is at 10 steps right and 4 up. That's quite far. Maybe there's a closer ""win"" rule?

No, the only ""win"" is at 10 right, 4 up. So perhaps moving an ""is"" block next to ""baba"" and ""win"" to rearrange the rule. But how to get close enough?

Alternatively, maybe there's a key that I can pick up to get past a ""stop"" wall. The key is at 3 right, 3 up. If I can get to the key, then maybe use it on a door. The door is at 1 right, 1 down. But I'm at 2 down, so moving down 1 step would reach the door. But the door is probably locked unless I have the key. Once I have the key, I can unlock the door and proceed.

So the steps could be: move to the key's location (3 right, 3 up), pick it up (but in Baba Is You, you don't pick up keys; you just move towards them and interact), then use the key on the door. But how does that work? Maybe moving the key next to the door's rule?

Wait, the door's rule is at 8 steps right and 2 steps down. If I have the key, maybe I can move the key next to the door's rule to create ""key is door"" or something, but that's not the usual mechanics. Normally, you carry the key and then move to the door to open it.

But in Baba Is You, you can push objects if they're not stopped. So maybe after getting the key, I can move it to the door's position and then walk through. But I need to check if the door is a stop. Since the door's rule is present, but unless it's defined as stop, I can pass through it if I have the key. Wait, doors in Baba Is You are usually stop unless there's a rule saying otherwise. But here, the door's rule is present, so maybe it's a stop. So to pass through, I need a key.

But how do I associate the key with the door? Maybe by creating a rule like ""key is door"" or ""key unlocks door"". But I'm not sure. Alternatively, if I have the key (i.e., the key is in my position), then maybe I can move past the door. But I need to test this.

Alternatively, maybe the real goal is to reach the ""win"" rule by rearranging it. Since ""baba is you,"" if I can make ""baba is win,"" then touching the ""win"" area would make me win. So to do that, I need to move the ""is"" block next to ""baba"" and ""win"". The ""is"" block is at 4 steps right. So from my current position (2 steps down), I need to move up, then right, then manipulate the ""is"".

But the path is blocked by walls. Let's see: To move right from my position (2 down), there are walls at 5 steps right and varying up positions. So moving right directly isn't possible. Maybe I need to move up first.

Looking at the map, the walls are at 5 steps right and up to 4 steps up. So if I move up from my position (2 down), perhaps I can get to a higher level where there's a path. For example, moving up to 3 step up, but there's a wall at 5 right and 3 up. So that's blocking. Maybe move up to 4 step up, but again walls. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe move left. There's a rule ""is"" at 1 step to the right and 2 steps down. So moving left from my position (2 down) might be possible. Let me check the objects to the left. There's a rule ""you"" at 2 steps to the right and 2 steps down. Wait, no, ""you"" is at 2 steps to the right and 2 steps down relative to where? Maybe I need to visualize the grid.

Alternatively, perhaps the best approach is to move towards the key and then use it on the door. Let's try that.

From my current position (assumed to be where ""baba"" rule is, which is 2 steps down), I need to move up 3 steps and right 3 steps to get to the key at 3 right, 3 up. But the path is blocked by walls at 5 right. So maybe I need to go around. Let's see:

If I move up first to 1 step up, then check if there's a path. But there's a wall at 5 right and 1 step up. Hmm. Maybe moving left first. If I move left from my current position (2 down), maybe there's a path. The ""you"" rule is at 2 steps to the right and 2 steps down. Wait, perhaps the directions are relative. Maybe ""left"" from my position would take me towards lower right steps? This is getting confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is at 3 right, 3 up. If I can move in the direction of up and right, but avoiding walls. Let's see the walls:

- At 5 right and 4 up: wall
- At 5 right and 3 up: wall
- At 5 right and 2 up: wall
- At 5 right and 1 up: wall
- At 5 right: wall

So to the right beyond 5 is blocked. To the left, there's a rule ""is"" at 4 steps right. Maybe I can move left towards that ""is"" block.

Wait, the ""is"" block is at 4 steps right. So from my position (assuming I'm at 0,0), moving right to 4 would get to that ""is"". Then maybe I can move that ""is"" block to create a new rule.

If I move the ""is"" from 4 right to next to ""baba"" (which is at 2 down), then I could make ""baba is win"" by placing ""win"" next to it. But the ""win"" is at 10 right, 4 up. That's far away. Maybe there's a closer ""win"" rule? No, only one.

Alternatively, maybe create a rule that makes ""baba"" win by rearranging existing rules. For example, if there's a rule ""win is you"", then since Baba is you, touching win would make you win. But the current active rules are only ""baba is you"". The other rules are ""win"", ""wall"", ""stop"", ""key"", ""door"", etc., but they're all as separate text blocks.

Alternatively, maybe I need to push the ""win"" rule closer. But the ""win"" rule is at 10 right, 4 up. To move it, I would need to move it left and down, but that might not be possible if it's blocked by walls.

This is getting complicated. Let's recap:

- Goal: Reach ""win"" which is at 10 right, 4 up.
- Key is at 3 right, 3 up. Maybe need to get that first.
- Door is at 1 right, 1 down. Maybe need to unlock it with the key.
- ""is"" blocks are movable if they're not stopped. So perhaps move an ""is"" to create a new rule.

Possible steps:

1. Move to the key's location (3 right, 3 up). To do this, from my current position (2 down), move up to 3 up, then right to 3. But there's a wall at 5 right, so maybe can't go right past 5. Wait, the key is at 3 right, which is left of the walls. So maybe possible.

Wait, the walls are at 5 right and up to 4 up. So from my position (2 down), moving up 1 step to 1 up, then right to 3 right. That should be possible if there's no wall there. Looking at the objects, at 3 right and 1 up, there's a wall. Oh right, wall 3 steps to the right and 1 step up. So can't go there.

Hmm, that's a problem. So moving right from 3 right would hit the wall. Maybe need to find another path.

Alternatively, move up to 4 step up, then left or right. At 4 step up, there's a wall at 5 right and 4 up. So still blocked. Maybe this approach isn't working.

Alternative idea: Use the ""is"" block to create a rule that allows moving through walls. For example, if I can make ""wall is push"" or ""stop is nothing"". But that requires manipulating the rules.

The ""is"" block is at 4 steps right. If I move that ""is"" next to ""wall"" and change its property, maybe. For example, moving ""is"" to after ""wall"", making ""wall is push"". Then walls can be pushed. But I need to see where the ""is"" is located.

The ""is"" at 4 right is currently separate. If I move it next to ""wall"" (which is at 3 step up), maybe I can change the wall's property. But the ""wall"" rule is at 3 step up. So moving the ""is"" from 4 right to next to ""wall"" at 3 up, creating ""wall is [something]"".

But I'm not sure what to change it to. If I make ""wall is push"", then I can push walls out of the way. But how to do that?

Alternatively, make ""baba is win"" by moving ""is"" next to ""baba"" and ""win"". The ""baba"" rule is at 2 steps down. The ""win"" is at 10 right, 4 up. That's a distance. Maybe I can't reach them both with an ""is"" block in between.

This is tricky. Let's think differently. The ""you"" rule is at 2 steps to the right and 2 steps down. Since ""baba is you"", that means Baba has the ""you"" property. The ""win"" rule is separate. To win, I need to touch the ""win"" area, but currently, the rule is ""baba is you"", not ""baba is win"". So unless I change the rule, touching win won't do anything.

So the key is to create a rule ""baba is win"". To do that, I need to have an ""is"" block next to ""baba"" and ""win"". The existing ""is"" blocks are at 7 right, 4 up; 9 right, 4 up; etc. But those are far from ""baba"" and ""win"".

The closest ""is"" block is at 4 steps right. If I can move that ""is"" block to be between ""baba"" and ""win"", then I can create the desired rule. But how to move it there?

From my current position (2 steps down), I need to move up and left to reach the ""is"" at 4 right. Let's see:

Current position: Assume (0,0), but the exact coordinates are unclear. The ""baba"" rule is at 2 steps down, so maybe (0, -2). The ""is"" block is at 4 steps right, so (4,0). To move from (0,-2) to (4,0), need to move right and up. But there are walls at 5 right and up to 4 up. So moving right past 5 is blocked. Moving up to 4 up is also blocked by walls.

This suggests that physically moving to the ""is"" block is impossible due to walls. So maybe I need to find another way to manipulate the rules without moving there physically.

Wait, perhaps there's a rule that allows moving text blocks. But the only rules are the ones listed. If ""baba is you"", and if I can push text blocks (since they're not stopped), maybe I can push an ""is"" block towards the desired location.

For example, if I push the ""is"" block at 4 right towards left, maybe into a position between ""baba"" and ""win"". But to push it, I need to be adjacent to it and move in the direction, which might be possible if there's no wall blocking.

The ""is"" block is at 4 right. To push it left, I need to be to its left and move left, which would push it left. From my position at 2 down, can I reach the ""is"" block at 4 right by moving up and right?

If I move up to 1 up, then right to 4 right, but there's a wall at 3 right and 1 up. So that path is blocked. Hmm.

Alternatively, move up to 4 up, then right to 4 right. But again, walls block the way.

This seems impossible. Maybe I need to create a rule that makes walls pushable or removes their stop property.

For example, if I can make ""stop is nothing"", then walls wouldn't block movement. To do that, I need to find an ""is"" block and move it to create ""stop is nothing"".

The ""is"" block is at 4 right. If I move it next to ""stop"" (which is at 1 step right and 3 step up), I could create ""stop is nothing"". Let's see:

""stop"" is at 1 right, 3 up. The ""is"" is at 4 right. To move the ""is"" block to next to ""stop"", I need to move it leftwards. From 4 right to 1 right + 1 step (since ""stop"" is at 1 right, so next to it would be 2 right?). Wait, directions are relative. If ""stop"" is at 1 right and 3 up, then to the right of it is 2 right, 3 up. So moving the ""is"" block from 4 right to 2 right, 3 up would place it next to ""stop"", creating ""stop is [something]"".

If I place ""is"" next to ""stop"" and then add ""nothing"" or another property, but I don't have a ""nothing"" block. The available objects are wall, stop, key, door, is, win, you, baba.

So if I move ""is"" next to ""stop"" and then place ""nothing"" there, but ""nothing"" isn't an object on the map. So maybe not possible.

Alternatively, create ""stop is you"", which would make stop behave like you, but that might not help.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe the intended solution is to grab the key and use it on the door to proceed past it, then reach the win area.

The door is at 1 step right and 1 step down. To get there, from my position (2 down), I need to move down 1 step to reach the door's level. Then move right 1 step. But there's a wall at 5 right and 1 step down. Wait, the door is at 1 step right and 1 step down. So from my position (assuming I'm at 0,0, with down being negative), the door is at (1, -1). To get there, I need to move down to -1, then right to 1. But between me (0,0) and the door (1,-1), is there a clear path?

There's a wall at 5 right and 1 step down, but that's far to the right. So moving right from 0 to 1 should be possible if there's no wall. Checking the objects: the walls are at 5 right various up positions. So moving right to 1 should be clear. Then down to -1. So the path is possible.

Once at the door (1,-1), if I have the key, I can unlock it. To get the key, I need to move to its location (3 right, 3 up). But how?

Alternatively, maybe I","

I need to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me start by looking at the current observation. The active rule is still ""baba is you,"" which means I can move around and potentially manipulate other text blocks.

First, I need to check the objects on the map. There are walls in various positions, a key, a door, and some rules. The goal is usually to reach the 'win' condition, which might be the door or another object. Looking at the active rules, the 'win' is at 10 steps to the right and 4 steps up, but that's probably blocked by walls. 

I notice there's a key at 3 steps right and 3 steps up. Maybe I need to get that key to unlock the door. But how? The door is at 1 step right and 1 step down, which is closer. However, the door might be a 'stop' object unless its rule has changed. The 'door' rule is at 8 steps right and 2 steps down, saying ""door is door,"" so it's probably still a stop. 

Looking at the rules, there's a ""rule `you` 2 steps to the right and 2 steps down."" Since I'm Baba and the rule is ""baba is you,"" maybe I can move to that 'you' rule and then rearrange it to make myself win. 

Wait, to change rules, I need to touch a text block while being able to move it. The 'you' rule is at 2 steps right and 2 steps down. If I can get there, maybe I can move the 'you' text block to say ""baba is win"" or something. But first, I need to navigate through the walls. 

The walls are pretty spread out. The path to the 'you' rule might be blocked, but perhaps I can move some 'is' rules to create a path. For example, if I can move an 'is' block next to 'baba' and 'win,' I could make ""baba is win."" 

Alternatively, the existing 'is' rules are at various positions. There's a rule `is` at 4 steps to the right, which is next to the wall. If I can move that 'is' block, maybe I can attach it to 'baba' and 'you' to create ""baba is you"" again, but that's redundant. Wait, the current rule is already ""baba is you,"" so maybe I need to create a new rule. 

Another approach: The 'door' is a stop, but if I can make the door a 'win' instead, then stepping on it would solve the level. To do that, I need to move the 'win' rule to the door's position. The 'win' rule is at 10 steps right and 4 up. That's far away. Maybe I can use the key to reach higher areas? 

The key is at 3 right, 3 up. If I can get the key, maybe I can use it to unlock something, but I don't see a lock. Alternatively, moving the 'key' rule to somewhere useful. Hmm. 

Let me map out the positions. I'm assuming Baba is at the starting position, but the exact location isn't specified here. The key is 3 right and 3 up from somewhere. The 'you' rule is 2 right and 2 down. The door is 1 right and 1 down. 

To reach the 'you' rule at 2 right, 2 down, I need to move down and right. But there are walls at 5 steps right in various directions. Maybe I can find a path by moving through the lower sections. 

Looking at the objects, there's a rule `is` at 4 steps right. If I can move that 'is' block next to 'baba' and 'you,' I could create ""baba is you,"" but that's already the case. Alternatively, move 'is' to 'baba' and 'win' to make ""baba is win."" 

The 'win' rule is way to the right and up. To get there, I might need to push past walls. But the walls are at 5 steps right, so maybe there's a gap. 

Alternatively, since the 'you' rule is already there, maybe I can move it to 'baba' and 'win.' For example, if I can move the 'you' block to be next to 'baba' and 'win,' then the rule would become ""baba is win,"" making Baba the win condition. Then, stepping on the door (which is a stop unless changed) might not work, but if the win is Baba, just standing on Baba would be sufficient. Wait, no—the win condition is usually an object, like a flag or door. But if I make ""baba is win,"" then being Baba would make me the win condition. 

So the plan could be: move the 'you' rule to 'baba' and 'win' to create ""baba is win."" To do that, I need to touch the 'you' block and drag it between 'baba' and 'win.' But how to reach that position? 

The 'you' block is at 2 steps right and 2 steps down. The 'baba' rule is at 2 steps left and 5 steps down. The 'win' rule is at 10 steps right and 4 steps up. That's quite far. Maybe there's a shorter path. 

Alternatively, use existing 'is' blocks to form new rules. For example, there's a rule `is` at 4 steps right. If I can move that 'is' to connect 'baba' and 'win,' that would work. But getting there requires navigating through walls. 

Another idea: The door is at 1 right and 1 down. If I can make the door into a 'win' by moving the 'win' rule there. The 'win' rule is at 10 right, 4 up. To move it, I need to push it past the walls. But the path is blocked by walls at 5 steps right in various directions. 

Maybe I should first grab the key. The key is at 3 right, 3 up. To get there, I need to move right and up, but there's a wall at 3 right, 1 up. Wait, looking at the objects: there's a wall at 3 steps right and 1 step up. So I can't go directly right and up. Maybe move down first? 

Alternatively, use the existing 'is' rules to create a path. For example, if I can make a rule that allows pushing through walls, but I don't see a 'push' rule. 

This is getting complicated. Let me try to outline possible steps:

1. Move towards the 'you' rule at 2 right, 2 down. But need to navigate around walls. 

2. Once at the 'you' rule, move it next to 'baba' and 'win' to create ""baba is win.""

3. Then, stepping on any tile would make me win.

But how to reach the 'you' rule? Let me check the current position of Baba. Since the observation doesn't specify Baba's location, I have to assume it's somewhere. Maybe near the starting area. 

Alternatively, focus on moving the 'win' rule to the door. The door is at 1 right, 1 down. The 'win' rule is at 10 right, 4 up. That's a long way. Maybe use the key to unlock a path, but I don't see a lock. 

Wait, maybe the key is a red herring. The real solution is to change the 'door' rule. The 'door' rule is at 8 steps right and 2 steps down, saying ""door is door."" If I can change that to ""door is win,"" then stepping on the door would make me win. 

To do that, I need to move the 'win' rule (at 10 right,4 up) next to the 'door' rule and the 'door' object. That seems impossible because of the walls. 

Alternatively, use an existing 'is' block. There's an 'is' at 4 steps right. If I can move that 'is' next to 'door' and 'win,' but again, the distance is too much. 

Maybe the solution is simpler. Since the active rule is ""baba is you,"" I can move any object that isn't stopped. The 'stop' objects are walls and possibly the door. 

Looking at the objects, the door is a 'stop' unless its rule is changed. The 'door' rule is ""door is door,"" so it's a stop. To make the door passable, I need to change its rule to something else, like ""door is you"" or ""door is win."" 

But how to reach the 'door' rule at 8 right, 2 down? It's blocked by walls. 

Another angle: The 'key' is at 3 right, 3 up. If I can get the key and use it to move something, but I don't see a lock. Maybe the key is just a way to access a higher area. 

Wait, the 'win' rule is high up, but maybe there's a way to move it down. If I can push the 'win' rule left and down, past the walls. The 'win' rule is at 10 right,4 up. To move it left, I need to be next to it and push. But the path is blocked by walls at 5 steps right. 

Alternatively, use the 'is' rule at 7 right,4 up (from the initial observation). If I can move that 'is' to connect 'baba' and 'win,' but I'm not sure. 

This is really tricky. Maybe I should try to move the 'you' rule to 'baba' and 'win.' Let's see: the 'you' rule is at 2 right, 2 down. The 'baba' rule is at 2 left,5 down. The 'win' rule is at 10 right,4 up. That's a big distance. 

Alternatively, create a new rule by moving an 'is' block. For example, take the 'is' at 4 right and move it between 'baba' (which is at 2 left,5 down) and 'win' (10 right,4 up). But that would require moving the 'is' a lot, which might not be possible due to walls. 

Wait, maybe the solution is to make the door a win by rearranging the existing rules. The 'door' is at 1 right,1 down. The 'win' rule is at 10 right,4 up. If I can move the 'win' rule to the door's position, but that's too far. 

Alternatively, use the key to reach higher areas. The key is at 3 right,3 up. If I can pick it up and use it to push blocks, but I don't think keys do anything in this game unless there's a lock. 

Maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think step by step. 

Current active rule: Baba is you. So I can move freely (except stopped by stop objects). 

Objects of interest:

- Key at 3 right,3 up. Maybe to unlock something.

- Door at 1 right,1 down (stop).

- Win rule at 10 right,4 up.

- You rule at 2 right,2 down.

Possible actions:

1. Move towards the 'you' rule to change it.

2. Move towards the 'win' rule to change it.

3. Use the key to access a new area.

But navigating to these positions is blocked by walls. 

Looking at the map layout:

- Walls are at 3 right in various up/down positions.

- The 'is' rules are scattered, but not near the key or door.

Maybe the key is a distraction. The real solution is to change the door's rule. 

To change the door's rule from 'door is door' to 'door is win,' I need to move the 'win' text next to the door. But the 'win' is too far. 

Alternatively, create a new rule 'door is win' using existing 'is' blocks. For example, take an 'is' block and place it between 'door' and 'win.' 

The 'door' rule is at 8 right,2 down. The 'win' rule is at 10 right,4 up. There's an 'is' block at 7 right,4 up. Maybe move that 'is' down to connect with 'door' and 'win.' 

But how to get there? The path is blocked by walls at 5 right. 

Alternatively, use the 'is' block at 4 right. Move it left to connect with 'door' and 'win.' But again, distance is an issue. 

This is really challenging. Maybe I should try moving the 'you' rule to make myself win. Since I'm Baba and 'you,' if I can make 'baba is win,' then I win by existing. 

To do that, I need to touch the 'you' rule and move it next to 'baba' and 'win.' The 'you' is at 2 right,2 down. 'Baba' rule is at 2 left,5 down. 'Win' is at 10 right,4 up. That's a long way. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a shorter path. For example, move the 'you' rule to the existing 'is' block at 4 right, then attach it to 'baba' and 'win.' But I'm not sure. 

Another idea: Use the 'is' block at 7 right,4 up (from the initial observation) to create ""baba is win."" But 'baba' is at 2 left,5 down. The distance is too much. 

Perhaps the key is needed to move past walls. For example, if the key is at 3 right,3 up, maybe I can move it and use it to push a wall, but I don't think keys can push walls. 

Wait, in Baba Is You, keys can be used to unlock locks, but there's no lock here. So the key might be a red herring. 

Given all this, maybe the correct action is to move towards the 'you' rule at 2 right,2 down, then move it to connect with 'baba' and 'win.' But how to reach that spot? 

Assuming I'm starting near the initial position, which has a 'rule `is`' at 6 right,1 up. Maybe I can move right and up, but there's a wall at 3 right,1 up. So I need to find another path. 

Alternatively, move down and left to reach the 'you' rule. 

But this is getting too vague without knowing Baba's exact position. 

Given the time I've spent and the previous failures, maybe the best action now is to move left towards the 'you' rule, hoping to reach it and rearrange the rules. 

So, the chosen action is left.

50,Failed to obtain a valid action from the reasoning.,"<reasoning>
Let me try to figure out what to do here. The active rule is still ""baba is you,"" which means I can move around and interact with objects. Looking at the objects on the map, there's a door labeled ""win"" somewhere up high. But there are walls blocking the path. Right now, the key is at 3 steps right and 3 steps up. Maybe I need to get that key to unlock the door? But how?

I notice there are ""rule `is`"" blocks scattered around. Maybe I can rearrange them to change the rules. For example, if I can move the ""is"" next to ""key"" and ""win,"" I could create a rule like ""key is win,"" making the key the win condition. But to do that, I need to move the ""is"" block. However, moving objects requires that they aren't marked as ""stop"" or similar immovable properties.

Looking at the current setup, the ""stop"" rule is at 1 step right and 3 steps up. So anything attached to that might be immovable. The ""is"" blocks seem movable since they're not listed as stop. So maybe I can push the ""is"" block at 4 steps right to the left towards the key and win rules.

But wait, to move an object, I have to be adjacent to it. My current position isn't clear from the observation, but maybe I can figure it out based on the objects. The key is at 3 right, 3 up. The ""is"" block is at 4 steps right. If I'm near there, I could move left to reach the ""is"" block. Once I move that ""is"" next to ""key"" and ""win,"" I can create a new rule.

Alternatively, maybe I can turn myself into the key by making ""baba is key."" If I can move the ""is"" block next to ""baba"" and ""key,"" that could work. The ""baba"" rule is at 2 steps down. So moving down to that area, then moving the ""is"" block there. But there's a wall at 5 steps right and 2 steps down. Hmm, maybe I need to navigate around that.

Another approach: The door is down at 1 step right and 1 step down. If I can make the door not a stop, maybe by changing the rule. But the ""door"" rule is at 8 steps right and 2 steps down. If I can move that rule somewhere else, or change it to something else. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the ""you"" rule is at 2 steps right and 2 steps down. Since I'm Baba and ""baba is you,"" maybe I can use that to push objects. If I move towards the ""is"" block at 4 steps right, I can push it left to where the key is. Then create ""key is win"" to make the key the win condition. Once I have the key, I can go to the door labeled win.

But how do I get the key? The key is at 3 right, 3 up. There's a wall at 5 steps right and 3 step up blocking the path. Maybe I can move the wall by changing its rule. The ""wall"" rule is at 3 step up. If I can move that rule away, the wall would no longer be a wall. But the rule is at 3 step up, so maybe I can push it left or right.

Alternatively, since I'm Baba and can be pushed if I'm not stop, maybe I can push the wall. But walls are usually stop, so unless the rule is changed. This is getting complicated. Maybe the key is more important. Let me focus on getting the key first.

To reach the key at 3 right, 3 up, I need to move up from my current position. But there's a wall at 5 right and 3 up. Wait, the wall is to the right of me. So maybe I need to go left to avoid the wall. But where am I located? The observation doesn't specify my position, which is a problem. Without knowing where I am, it's hard to navigate.

Assuming I'm near the lower part of the map, maybe at the door area. The door is at 1 right, 1 down. If I move up from there, I might hit the wall. Alternatively, move left to get past the wall. But there's a rule ""is"" at 4 steps right. Maybe I can move that ""is"" block left to where the key is. Let's see:

If I move left to the ""is"" block at 4 steps right, then move it left to 3 steps right (next to the key). Then place it between ""key"" and ""win"" to make ""key is win."" Then pick up the key and go to the door. But how do I move the ""is"" block? I need to be adjacent to it. So first, move left to 4 steps right, then left again to 3 steps right. Then push the ""is"" block left to where the key is. Once that's done, create the new rule.

Alternatively, if I can make ""baba is key,"" then I would be the key and could walk over the win door. But to do that, I need to move the ""is"" block next to ""baba"" and ""key."" The ""baba"" rule is at 2 steps down. So moving down to that area, then moving the ""is"" block there. Let's see:

Current position might be near the lower part. Move down to 2 steps down, where the ""baba"" rule is. Then move the ""is"" block from 1 step right and 2 steps down to be next to ""baba"" and ""key."" So place ""is"" between ""baba"" and ""key"" to make ""baba is key."" Then since I'm Baba and key, stepping on the door labeled win would win the level.

This seems possible. So the steps would be:

1. Move down to the ""baba"" rule at 2 steps down.
2. Move left to the ""is"" block at 1 step right and 2 steps down.
3. Push the ""is"" block left to be adjacent to ""baba"" and ""key.""
4. Now the rule would be ""baba is key,"" making me the key.
5. Move towards the door labeled win, which is at 1 step right and 1 step down. Since I'm the key, stepping on it would win.

But how to execute this step by step. First, need to navigate to the ""is"" block. Let's see the current objects again:

- rule `is` 1 step to the left and 2 steps down (from the observation: ""rule `is` 1 step to the left and 2 steps down"")
Wait, the exact positions might be tricky. Let me parse the observation again.

The objects are listed as:

- rule `baba` 2 step to the left and 5 steps down
- rule `is` 1 step to the left and 5 steps down
- rule `you` 5 steps down
- rule `door` 6 steps to the right and 5 steps down

Wait, perhaps my earlier analysis was incorrect. Let me recheck.

The latest observation lists:

Objects on the map:

- wall 5 steps to the right and 4 step up
- rule `is` 9 steps to the right and 4 step up
- rule `win` 10 steps to the right and 4 step up
- rule `wall` 3 step up
- rule `stop` 1 step to the right and 3 step up
- key 3 steps to the right and 3 step up
- wall 5 steps to the right and 3 step up
- wall 5 steps to the right and 2 step up
- wall 5 steps to the right and 1 step up
- rule `is` 4 steps to the right
- wall 5 steps to the right
- rule `key` 9 steps to the right
- door 1 step to the right and 1 step down
- wall 5 steps to the right and 1 step down
- rule `baba` 2 steps down
- rule `is` 1 step to the right and 2 steps down
- rule `you` 2 steps to the right and 2 steps down
- wall 5 steps to the right and 2 steps down
- rule `door` 8 steps to the right and 2 steps down

Hmm, so the ""rule `baba`"" is at 2 steps down, not 2 steps left. The ""rule `is`"" near there is at 1 step to the right and 2 steps down. The ""rule `you`"" is at 2 steps to the right and 2 steps down.

So if I'm at the lower part, maybe near the door at 1 right, 1 down. To get to the ""baba"" rule at 2 steps down, I need to move down twice. But there's a wall at 5 steps right and 2 steps down. So moving down from my current position (assuming I'm at the door area) would take me to 1 right, 2 down, which is where the ""is"" rule is. Then I can move left to reach the ""baba"" rule at 2 steps down.

Once there, I can move the ""is"" block from 1 right, 2 down to be next to ""baba"" and ""key"". The ""key"" is at 3 right, 3 up, which is up and to the left. But that might be too far.

Alternatively, maybe I should focus on creating ""key is win"" by moving the ""is"" block next to the key and win rules. The key is at 3 right, 3 up, and win is at 10 right, 4 up. The ""is"" block is at 9 right, 4 up (same as win's vertical position). So moving the ""is"" from 9 right,4 up to between key (3 right,3 up) and win (10 right,4 up). But that's a long distance. Maybe not feasible.

Another angle: The ""you"" rule is at 2 right, 2 down. Since I'm Baba and ""baba is you,"" maybe combining with the ""you"" rule can help. If I can make ""you is win,"" then stepping on win would work. But to do that, I need to move the ""is"" block next to ""you"" and ""win"". The ""win"" rule is at 10 right,4 up. That's far away.

Alternatively, make ""door is win."" The door is at 1 right,1 down. If I can move the ""is"" block next to ""door"" and ""win,"" then ""door is win"" would make the door the win condition. Then I just need to reach the door. But the door is behind a wall at 5 right,1 down. Unless I can remove the wall's rule.

The wall's rule is at 3 step up. If I can move that rule away, the wall at 5 right,3 up would no longer be a wall. So moving the ""wall"" rule from 3 step up to somewhere else. For example, push it left or right. But how?

Alternatively, since I'm Baba and can be pushed if not stop, maybe I can push the wall. But walls are usually stop. Unless the rule ""wall is stop"" is changed. But the current rules are only ""baba is you."" The other rules like ""wall is stop"" might be implicit. Wait, in Baba Is You, the default rules are ""baba is you,"" ""wall is stop,"" ""flag is win,"" etc. But in this level, the active rules are only ""baba is you."" The other rules must be present as text blocks on the map.

Looking at the objects, there's a rule `wall` at 3 step up, which probably means ""wall is [something]."" But in the observation, it's listed as ""rule `wall` 3 step up."" Wait, the format is ""[Subject] IS [Property]"" as text blocks. So a rule `wall` would be ""wall is [something]"" but the something is missing. That's probably a typo or incomplete observation. Alternatively, maybe it's ""wall is stop,"" which is a default rule. If that's the case, then the wall is stop.

Assuming that the ""rule `wall` 3 step up"" is actually ""wall is stop,"" then the wall at 5 right,3 up is a stop. So I can't push through it. But if I can change that rule to something else, like ""wall is push,"" then I could move the wall. But changing that would require manipulating the text block.

So, to eliminate the wall's stop property, I need to move the ""wall is stop"" rule. The ""wall"" rule is at 3 step up. If I can move that text block away, the wall would no longer be stop. For example, move the ""wall"" rule to the left or right, making the rule ""wall is [something else]"" or removing it.

But how to move the ""wall"" rule. It's at 3 step up. To move it, I need to be adjacent to it and push it. Since I'm Baba and ""baba is you,"" I can push it if it's not stop. But the ""wall"" rule itself is a text block, which might be movable unless there's a ""stop"" rule on it. The ""stop"" rule is at 1 step right and 3 step up, which is a different position. So the ""wall"" rule at 3 step up is likely movable.

So the plan could be:

1. Move to the ""wall"" rule at 3 step up.
2. Push it left or right to remove it, thus eliminating the ""wall is stop"" rule.
3. Now the wall at 5 right,3 up is just a wall (without the stop property), so I can push it out of the way.
4. Then proceed to the key or the door.

But how to reach the ""wall"" rule at 3 step up. From the current position, which is unclear, but assuming I'm near the door area (1 right,1 down), moving up would take me through walls. Let's see:

The path from door (1 right,1 down) up to 3 step up would require moving up two steps, but there are walls at 5 right,3 up. Wait, perhaps the layout is such that the upper part has walls horizontally. Maybe I need to go around.

Alternatively, focus on creating ""key is win"" rule. The key is at 3 right,3 up. The ""is"" block is at 9 right,4 up. To get there, I need to move the ""is"" block from 9 right,4 up to between key (3 right,3 up) and win (10 right,4 up). That's a distance of 6 steps left. But that's a long way. Maybe not feasible.

Alternatively, take a different approach. Since I'm Baba and can be anything if I change the rules, maybe make myself the win. For example, ""baba is win."" To do that, move the ""is"" block next to ""baba"" and ""win."" The ""baba"" rule is at 2 steps down, and ""win"" is at 10 right,4 up. That's a big distance. Not practical.

Alternatively, make ""door is win."" The door is at 1 right,1 down. The ""is"" block is at 1 step right and 2 steps down. So moving the ""is"" block from there to between door and win. The ""win"" is at 10 right,4 up. That's still far.

This is tricky. Maybe the key is the priority. Get the key by moving the ""is"" block next to it and ""win"" to make ""key is win."" Then pick up the key and go to the door labeled win.

To get the key at 3 right,3 up, need to navigate through the walls. The path is blocked by walls at 5 right,3 up. If I can remove those walls by changing their rules, that would help. The ""wall"" rule is at 3 step up. If I move that rule away, the walls would no longer be walls.

So step-by-step:

1. Move to the ""wall"" rule at 3 step up. Its position is 3 steps up, but the horizontal position isn't clear. Looking at the objects, there's a wall at 5 right,3 up. The ""wall"" rule is likely at the same horizontal position, or somewhere else. The observation says ""rule `wall` 3 step up,"" which might mean it's 3 steps up from the player's current position, but without knowing where the player is, it's hard to tell.

Assuming the player is near the lower part, let's say at position (0,0). Then ""3 step up"" would be (0,3). The wall at 5 right,3 up would be (5,3). The ""wall"" rule is at (0,3). To move it, I need to go to (0,3) and push it left or right.

So:

- Move up three times to reach (0,3).
- Push the ""wall"" rule left to (1,3), changing the rule to ""wall is [something else]"" or removing it. But the exact effect depends on where we move it. If we move it off the map, the wall at (5,3) would no longer be a wall.

Once the wall is removed, I can path through to the key.

Alternatively, if moving the ""wall"" rule isn't feasible, maybe focus on creating a new rule to bypass the wall. For example, ""push is you,"" making me able to push objects. But to do that, need to create the rule ""push is you"" by moving an ""is"" block next to ""push"" and ""you."" But there's no ""push"" rule on the map, so that's not possible.

Another idea: Use the existing ""you"" rule at 2 right,2 down. Since I'm Baba and ""baba is you,"" maybe combining with ""you"" to create new rules. For example, ""you is win"" by moving the ""is"" block next to ""you"" and ""win."" The ""win"" is at 10 right,4 up. The ""you"" rule is at 2 right,2 down. Moving the ""is"" block from 1 right,2 down to between ""you"" and ""win"" would create ""you is win."" Then, since I'm you, stepping on the win door would work.

To do that:

1. Move to the ""is"" block at 1 right,2 down.
2. Push it up to be next to ""you"" at 2 right,2 down and ""win"" at 10 right,4 up. But that","

Let's try to figure out the next move here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means whatever I do, I can manipulate the rules since I'm Baba. The goal seems to be getting to the ""win"" object, but I need to check where that is. In the current observation, the ""win"" rule is 10 steps to the right and 4 steps up. That's pretty far, and there are walls blocking the way up. There's a key somewhere, maybe I need to get that first.

Looking at the objects, there's a key at 3 steps right and 3 steps up. To get there, I need to move up from my current position. But wait, the path might be blocked by walls. Let me map out the positions.

The walls are arranged in a pattern: every 3 steps right and 1 step up, then 2 steps down, etc. Maybe there's a way to navigate around them. Also, there are ""is"" rules floating around. If I can move those ""is"" blocks to form new rules, like ""baba is win"" or ""key is you,"" that might help.

But first, I need to reach the key. The door at 1 step right and 1 step down might be a way to proceed, but I don't know if it's locked. If I can make the door not a stop, maybe I can go through it. Alternatively, if I can turn myself into the key by creating a rule like ""baba is key,"" then I could pick up the key without moving to it physically.

Wait, the ""you"" rule is at 2 steps right and 2 steps down. If I can move the ""you"" rule onto Baba, then maybe I can change other rules. Let me check the positions again. The ""baba"" rule is at 2 steps down, and there's an ""is"" rule at 1 step right and 2 steps down. If I move that ""is"" next to ""baba,"" I could make a new rule like ""baba is something.""

But how do I move the ""is"" blocks? The game allows moving text blocks that aren't ""stop."" The ""stop"" rule is at 1 step right and 3 steps up, so I can probably move other blocks. Let's see: the ""is"" at 4 steps right is on the ground. If I move left from my current position, maybe I can grab that ""is"" and place it near ""baba"" to create a new rule.

Alternatively, the ""key"" is 3 steps right and 3 steps up. To get there, I need to move up three times and right once. But the path is blocked by walls at 3 steps right and 3 steps up. Wait, the wall is at 5 steps right and 3 steps up. Maybe there's a different path. Let me visualize the grid:

- Current position: Assuming I'm starting somewhere, maybe at the lower left? Not sure, but the walls are spaced every 3 steps right. The key is at 3 right, 3 up. If I move up three times and right once, but there's a wall at 5 right, 3 up. So maybe I need to go around.

Alternatively, use the ""is"" rules to create a new rule that allows passing through walls. For example, if I make ""wall is stop,"" but wait, ""stop"" is already a rule. Or maybe ""wall is nothing,"" but I don't have a ""nothing"" rule. Hmm.

Another approach: Since I'm Baba and can create rules, maybe I can turn myself into the win object. If I can create ""baba is win,"" then touching the win rule would make me win. The win rule is at 10 right, 4 up. That's far, but if I can move the ""win"" rule closer or make myself win, that could work.

But how to move the ""win"" rule? I need to find an ""is"" block and move it next to ""win"" to change its subject. The ""is"" blocks are scattered. There's one at 9 right, 4 up (same as win's position), but that's part of the ""win is you"" maybe? Not sure. The active rule is only ""baba is you.""

Wait, the initial active rule is ""baba is you,"" so I need to create other rules by moving ""is"" blocks. Let's see: the ""is"" at 4 steps right. If I move that to next to ""baba,"" then I can make a new rule. For example, ""baba is win"" by placing ""is"" between ""baba"" and ""win."" But where is ""baba"" located? The ""baba"" rule is at 2 steps down. So if I can move the ""is"" from 4 right to be next to ""baba"" at 2 steps down, then I can create ""baba is win.""

But how to move the ""is"" block? The user can move left, right, up, or down, but only objects that aren't ""stop."" The ""stop"" is at 1 right, 3 up, so I can move other blocks. The ""is"" at 4 right is on the ground (no step up/down mentioned), so I can move it left or right. If I move that ""is"" to the left towards the ""baba"" rule at 2 steps down, maybe I can form a new rule.

Alternatively, the ""is"" at 1 step right and 2 steps down (next to ""you"" rule). If I can move that ""is"" up to the ""baba"" rule at 2 steps down, then combine them into ""baba is you"" (but that's already active). Not helpful. Maybe move it to create ""baba is door"" or something.

Wait, the door is at 1 right and 1 down. If I make ""baba is door,"" then touching the door would make me win. But the door is behind a wall at 5 right, 1 down. Hmm.

Alternatively, use the key. If I can pick up the key by making ""key is you,"" then I can move the key to the win rule. But to do that, I need to create ""key is you."" The ""you"" rule is at 2 right and 2 down. If I can move the ""is"" block next to ""key"" and ""you,"" that would work. The key is at 3 right, 3 up. The ""is"" block at 4 right is on the ground. Maybe move that ""is"" up to 3 right, 3 up (next to key) and then right again to 4 right, 3 up, placing it between key and you? Not sure.

This is getting complicated. Maybe the simplest way is to move towards the key, avoiding walls. Let's see the path from current position (not sure where, but assuming I'm near the start):

To get to the key at 3 right, 3 up:

- Move up once (to 3 up), but there's a wall at 5 right, 3 up. So maybe move up, then left? Wait, the walls are every 3 steps right. So from my current position, maybe I can move up, then right twice, then up again? Not sure.

Alternatively, use the ""is"" blocks to create a rule that lets me walk through walls. For example, ""wall is stop"" is already there, but maybe change it to ""wall is nothing."" To do that, I need to move the ""is"" block next to ""wall"" and make it ""wall is nothing."" The ""wall"" rule is at 2 left and 3 step up. The ""is"" block is at 7 right, 4 up. That's too far.

This is tricky. Maybe focus on moving the ""is"" block at 4 right to create a new rule. If I move that ""is"" left to 3 right, then place it next to ""baba"" at 2 steps down, forming ""baba is win."" Then, even if there are walls, since I'm Baba and the rule is ""baba is win,"" touching the win area would make me win. But how to position the ""is"" block correctly.

Alternatively, the ""win"" rule is at 10 right, 4 up. If I can move the ""win"" rule closer, but that requires an ""is"" block. Not sure.

Another angle: The ""door"" is at 1 right, 1 down. If I can make the door not a stop, then I can go through it. For example, change ""door is stop"" to ""door is nothing."" The ""door"" rule is at 6 right, 5 down. The ""is"" block next to it is at 2 steps right and 3 steps down. Maybe move that ""is"" to the door's position.

Wait, the ""is"" block at 2 steps right and 3 steps down is part of the ""wall is stop"" rule? Not sure. Maybe I need to get to that ""is"" block to modify the door's properties.

This is getting too time-consuming. Maybe the best immediate action is to move left towards the ""is"" block at 4 steps right, pick it up, and move it to near ""baba"" to create a new rule. That might help in manipulating the game further.

52,right,"<reasoning>
The game is Baba Is You, and my current goal is to figure out how to reach the ""win"" condition. Let's look at the active rules. Right now, ""baba is you,"" which means whatever I do, Baba can interact with things based on the rules.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key located at 3 steps to the right and 3 steps up. The door is at 1 step to the right and 1 step down. But wait, the door might be a ""stop"" because some rules mention ""stop"" walls. Also, there's a ""rule `you`"" at 2 steps to the right and 2 steps down. Hmm, maybe I need to interact with that.

The active rules include ""baba is you,"" so I can move around as Baba. But the door might be blocking the path. The key is up there, but there are walls blocking the way. Let me check the positions again. The walls are positioned in a way that creates a barrier. Maybe I need to rearrange the rules to bypass them.

The ""rule `is`"" blocks are scattered. If I can move one of those ""is"" rules, I might be able to create a new rule. For example, if I take the ""rule `is`"" at 4 steps to the right and move it next to ""baba"" or another object, I could change a property. Like making ""baba is win"" or something. But first, I need to reach those ""is"" rules.

Wait, the key is at 3 steps right and 3 up. To get there, I might need to move up, but there's a wall at 5 steps right and 3 step up. So maybe I need to remove that wall's stop property. If I can change ""wall is stop"" to something else, maybe I can pass through. But how?

Alternatively, if I can make ""key is you,"" then stepping on the key would make me you, but I'm already Baba and you. Wait, the current rules have ""you"" at 2 steps right and 2 down. Maybe I need to go there and interact with the ""you"" rule.

Looking at the positions, the ""rule `you`"" is at 2 steps right and 2 steps down. If I can move that ""you"" rule next to Baba, then ""baba is you"" would still hold, but maybe combining with another rule. Alternatively, if I can make ""baba is win,"" then touching the win object would win the level.

But how to do that? Let's see. There's a ""rule `win`"" at 10 steps right and 4 up, which is far away. Not sure. Maybe I need to focus on the nearby ""is"" rules. The ""rule `is`"" at 4 steps right is on the ground level. If I can move that ""is"" next to ""baba,"" then I can create a new rule like ""baba is win"" by placing ""win"" next to it.

Wait, but where is the ""win"" object? The ""rule `win`"" is a text block, not the actual win object. The actual win condition is probably the door or another object labeled as win. Wait, in Baba Is You, sometimes the win object is a flag or a door. In this case, the door might be the win object, but it's blocked by ""stop"" walls.

Alternatively, the ""win"" text block is at 10 steps right and 4 up, but that's a rule, not the actual win object. The actual win condition is usually an object that's defined as win, like a flag. Maybe the door is the win object, but it's behind a stop wall.

So, the plan is: either find a way to remove the stop property from the walls blocking the door, or find the actual win object and reach it. But the door is at 1 step right and 1 down, which is near the bottom. However, there's a ""rule `stop`"" at 1 step right and 3 step up. Maybe that's part of the wall structure.

Alternatively, if I can change the ""stop"" rule to something else. But to do that, I need to move the ""rule `stop`"" text block. The ""stop"" rule is at 1 step right and 3 step up. If I can move that ""stop"" rule away, then the walls that are defined as stop might become passable.

But how do I move the text blocks? I need to be adjacent to them and not blocked by a ""stop"" or similar. Let me check the current position of Baba. The user hasn't provided Baba's position in the latest observation. Wait, the observations list the objects but not Baba's location. Maybe I need to infer it.

Looking at the objects, the ""rule `baba`"" is at 2 steps left and 5 steps down. Wait, no, in the latest observation, the ""rule `baba`"" is at 2 step to the left and 5 steps down. Wait, no, in the current observation, under objects, it's listed as ""rule `baba` 2 steps down"". Let me check again.

In the current observation's objects:

- rule `baba` 2 steps down
- rule `is` 1 step to the left and 5 steps down
- rule `you` 5 steps down
...

So the ""rule `baba`"" text block is 2 steps down from Baba's position? Or is Baba's position elsewhere? Wait, in Baba Is You, the player is usually represented by Baba, and the rules define their properties. The ""baba is you"" rule means that the entity controlled (Baba) can be manipulated based on the rules.

But the exact position of Baba isn't listed here. The objects listed are walls, rules, key, door, etc. So maybe I need to figure out where Baba is based on the rules. Alternatively, perhaps the assistant is supposed to track Baba's position based on previous actions.

Since the user hasn't provided Baba's position in the current observation, this complicates things. But assuming that the previous actions have moved Baba somewhere, perhaps the last action was ""left,"" which might have moved Baba left.

Alternatively, maybe the assistant is supposed to assume that Baba is at a default position, but that's unclear. Given the lack of position data, this is challenging. However, the previous actions were a series of left, down, etc., which might have positioned Baba somewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is to interact with the ""rule `you`"" at 2 steps to the right and 2 steps down. If I can move that ""you"" rule next to Baba, then ""baba is you"" combined with ""you is win"" might make Baba win. But there's no ""win"" rule adjacent.

Wait, the ""rule `win`"" is at 10 steps right and 4 up, which is far away. Maybe the actual win object is the door, which is at 1 step right and 1 step down. But the door is likely behind a stop wall. So how to remove the stop?

The ""rule `stop`"" is at 1 step right and 3 step up. If I can move that ""stop"" rule away, then the walls that are stop might become passable. To move the ""stop"" rule, I need to be adjacent to it and not blocked. Let's see where the ""stop"" rule is located: 1 step right and 3 step up. If I can get to that position, I can move it.

But how to get there? The path might be blocked by walls. Let's think step by step.

Current active rules: baba is you. So I can move around, pushing objects that are not stop.

The key is at 3 right, 3 up. There's a wall at 5 right, 3 up. So to get to the key, I need to go up 3 steps, but there's a wall at 5 right, 3 up. That wall is a stop, so I can't pass through. Maybe I need to remove the stop property from that wall.

To do that, I need to find the ""rule `stop`"" that applies to that wall. The ""rule `stop`"" is at 1 right, 3 up. If I can move that ""stop"" rule away, then the wall at 5 right, 3 up might become passable or not a stop anymore.

So the plan is: move to the position of the ""stop"" rule at 1 right, 3 up, then move that rule somewhere else, like next to the wall, to remove the stop property.

But how to navigate there. Let's assume Baba's current position is somewhere. Given the previous actions were left, down, etc., maybe Baba is to the left of the key area.

Alternatively, perhaps the best action is to move towards the ""rule `is`"" at 4 steps to the right. If I can move that ""is"" rule next to the ""win"" rule, then I can create ""baba is win"" by placing ""baba"" next to ""is"" and ""win"".

But the ""win"" rule is at 10 steps right and 4 up, which is far. Alternatively, there's a door at 1 right and 1 down. Maybe making the door a win by creating ""door is win"".

To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to the door and the ""win"" rule. But the door is at 1 right, 1 down. The ""rule `door`"" is at 6 steps right and 2 steps down. So perhaps moving the ""door"" rule next to the ""is"" and ""win"" rules.

But this is getting complicated. Let's focus on immediate actions. The closest ""is"" rule is at 4 steps to the right. If I can move that ""is"" rule, perhaps to create a new rule that makes Baba win.

Alternatively, the ""rule `you`"" at 2 right and 2 down. If I can move that ""you"" rule next to Baba, making ""baba is you"" redundant but perhaps combining with another rule.

Wait, the current rules are ""baba is you"". If I can make ""you is win"", then touching the win object would make Baba win. So the steps would be: move the ""you"" rule next to the ""win"" rule and a subject (like Baba or the door).

But the ""win"" rule is a text block at 10 right, 4 up. Not sure. Alternatively, the actual win object is the door. So if I can make ""door is win"", then stepping on the door would win.

To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to ""door"" and ""win"". The ""door"" rule is at 6 right, 2 down. The ""win"" rule is at 10 right, 4 up. That's a long way. Maybe not feasible.

Alternatively, focus on the key. Collecting the key might unlock something, but I don't see a lock.

Another approach: since ""baba is you"", perhaps I can push walls if they're not stop. But most walls are stop. The ""rule `stop`"" is at 1 right, 3 up. If I remove that, the walls might become passable.

So the plan is: move to the ""stop"" rule at 1 right, 3 up, then move that rule away. For example, move it down or left, so that the wall's stop property is removed.

To move the ""stop"" rule, I need to be adjacent to it. Let's assume my current position is near there. The ""stop"" rule is at 1 right, 3 up. If I can get there by moving up and right.

But how to reach that position. Let's see the obstacles. There's a wall at 5 right, 3 up, which is a stop. But if I can remove the stop property, I can pass. However, to get to the ""stop"" rule at 1 right, 3 up, I might need to navigate around other walls.

Alternatively, maybe the best action is to move left again, continuing the previous pattern, but that might not be effective.

Wait, the last observation had Baba possibly at 2 steps left and 5 steps down based on the ""rule `baba`"" position. But I'm not sure. This is getting too vague without knowing Baba's location.

Perhaps the safest action is to try moving towards the ""rule `is`"" at 4 steps to the right, as it's a key component for creating new rules. Moving right would get closer to that rule.

Alternatively, moving down towards the ""rule `you`"" at 2 steps right and 2 steps down. Maybe combining ""you"" with another rule.

But given the lack of position data, it's challenging. The assistant has to make a best guess based on previous actions. The user kept getting ""failed to obtain a valid action"" when suggesting left or down, so maybe those directions aren't effective now.

Looking at the current observation, the ""rule `is`"" is at 4 steps to the right. If I move right, I can get to that ""is"" rule. Then, maybe move it next to ""baba"" and ""win"" to create ""baba is win"".

So the action would be: move right to reach the ""is"" rule.

53,right,"<reasoning>
Let's see. The goal is to reach the ""win"" object, which is usually a door or something similar. In this level, the active rule is ""baba is you,"" meaning whatever I do, I can manipulate the rules by moving text blocks.

Looking at the objects, there's a key at 3 steps right and 3 steps up. I might need that to unlock a door, but right now the door is at 1 step down. Wait, the door's position has changed in previous observations. The active rules haven't changed except for the positions of the walls and rules as I move.

I see a ""rule `is`"" at 3 steps to the right. Since ""is"" is essential for creating rules, maybe I can move that to combine with other text blocks. For example, if I can create ""baba is win"" or ""you is win,"" that would make touching the door or another object win. But right now, the ""win"" rule is at 9 steps right and 4 steps up, which is far away.

There's a ""rule `you`"" at 2 steps to the right and 2 steps down. If I can connect ""baba"" with ""you"" using the ""is"" rule, then I become the YOU object. Then, if I can make ""baba is win"" or ""you is win,"" touching the door would be the win condition.

So the steps might be: move the ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" and ""win"" to create a new rule. But how to do that? I need to physically move the ""is"" text block. The current position of ""is"" is 3 steps to the right. If I move left from my current position, maybe I can reach it. Wait, where is the player (Baba) located? The observations don't explicitly state Baba's position, but based on the objects' positions relative to Baba, I might need to infer.

Alternatively, maybe the key is nearby. If I get the key, perhaps I can unlock something, but the door is already down at 1 step. Wait, the door is at 1 step down, but it's guarded by a ""rule `door`"" at 8 steps right and 2 steps down. Maybe the door is stopped by a wall or another rule. 

Another approach: since ""baba is you,"" I can push objects. If I can push a ""win"" rule onto the door, then touching it would win. Or change the door's rule to ""win."" But to do that, I need to move the ""win"" rule text block. The ""win"" is at 9 steps right and 4 steps up, which is quite far. Maybe moving left towards the ""is"" rule at 3 steps right, then combining ""baba is win"" by placing the blocks adjacent.

Wait, the ""rule `baba`"" is at 1 step left and 2 steps down. If I can move that closer to the ""is"" and ""win"" rules, I can create a new rule. Let me see the positions again:

- rule `baba`: 1 step left and 2 steps down
- rule `is`: 3 steps right
- rule `win`: 9 steps right and 4 steps up

So, if I could move the ""baba"" rule to be next to ""is"" and ""win,"" I could make ""baba is win."" But how to reach those positions? Maybe moving right towards the ""is"" rule, then up or down.

But the player's current position isn't given, so it's harder. The previous actions were moving left, down, etc., but the observations show that after some moves, the map shifts (like walls moving up or down). This suggests that moving certain objects might shift the entire level, which is common in Baba Is You.

Alternatively, focus on the ""rule `you`"" at 2 steps right and 2 steps down. If I can make ""you is win,"" then as the player (YOU), touching the door would win. To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to ""you"" and ""win."" The ""win"" is up high, so maybe moving down to where ""you"" is, then moving the ""is"" there.

But movement is step-based. The player can move up, down, left, right one step at a time. Given that the ""you"" rule is at 2 steps right and 2 steps down from where? Assuming the player is near the bottom left based on previous observations, moving right twice and down twice would reach the ""you"" rule. Then, move the ""is"" rule (which is at 3 steps right) to adjacent to ""you"" and ""win.""

But how to physically move the ""is"" rule? The player must be next to it and move it in a direction. If the player is at position (x,y), and the ""is"" is at (x+3, y), then moving right would take the player to (x+1, y), then right again to (x+2, y), then right to (x+3, y), which is the ""is"" rule. Then, the player can push the ""is"" rule further right or in another direction to combine with ""you"" and ""win.""

Alternatively, if the player can move the ""you"" rule next to ""is"" and ""win,"" that could work. But ""you"" is at 2 steps right and 2 steps down. Maybe moving the ""you"" rule up towards the ""is"" and ""win.""

This is getting complicated. Let's recap:

1. The goal is to make touching the door or another object count as a win.
2. Current rules: ""baba is you"" (so the player is Baba and can push objects).
3. Available rules to manipulate: ""is,"" ""win,"" ""wall,"" ""stop,"" ""key,"" ""baba,"" ""you,"" ""door.""
4. To create a new rule, need to place a subject next to ""is"" and then a property.

Possible solution:

- Move the ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" and ""win"" to create ""baba is win.""
- Then, touching the door (which is a ""win"" object) would win.

But where is the door located? In the current observation, the door is at 1 step down, and there's a ""rule `door`"" at 7 steps right and 2 steps down. So the actual door might be at 1 step down, but it's governed by the ""door"" rule. If I change the door's rule to ""win,"" then touching it would work.

Alternatively, make ""door is win,"" but that requires moving the ""is"" rule next to ""door"" and ""win.""

Another angle: since the player is Baba and can push objects, maybe push the ""win"" rule towards the door. If ""win"" is a property, then the door could become win by proximity.

But I think the standard approach is to create a rule like ""door is win"" or ""baba is win.""

Given the current objects:

- rule `door` is at 7 steps right and 2 steps down.
- rule `win` is at 9 steps right and 4 steps up.

Maybe move the ""win"" rule down to where the door is. To do that, the player needs to be near the ""win"" rule and push it down. But the player's position isn't specified, so it's hard to tell.

Alternatively, use the existing ""baba is you"" to push the ""is"" rule towards the ""baba"" and ""win"" rules. For example:

1. Move left to reach the ""is"" rule at 3 steps right.
2. Push the ""is"" rule to the right towards the ""win"" rule.
3. Then place ""baba"" next to ""is"" and ""win"" to create ""baba is win.""

But how to navigate there? The player might need to move right multiple times, overcoming any ""stop"" or ""wall"" rules.

Looking at the current observation, there's a ""stop"" rule at 3 steps up. So moving up past that might be blocked. Maybe need to remove the ""stop"" rule by moving it away, but that requires rearranging.

Alternatively, focus on the ""you"" rule. If I can make ""you is win,"" then as the player (YOU), touching anything win would work. The ""win"" rule is up high, so maybe move the ""you"" rule up and combine with ""is"" and ""win.""

But this is getting too vague without knowing the player's exact position. Given the previous actions were moving left and down, perhaps the player is moving towards the left side of the map.

In the last valid action, the assistant moved left, leading to the current observation where the ""rule `baba`"" is at 1 step left and 2 steps down, and ""rule `is`"" is at 3 steps right. Maybe the player is near the ""baba"" rule.

So possible steps:

- Move right twice to reach the ""is"" rule at 3 steps right.
- Then move the ""is"" rule down to the ""baba"" rule (1 step left, 2 steps down) and the ""win"" rule (9 steps right, 4 steps up). This seems impossible because the positions are too far apart.

Alternative plan: Use the key. The key is at 3 steps right and 3 steps up. Maybe pick up the key and use it to unlock something, but the door is at 1 step down, which might not require a key. Alternatively, the key could be used to move a rule by pushing it, but I don't see a lock object.

Another thought: The ""rule `door`"" is at 7 steps right and 2 steps down. If I can change this rule to ""win,"" then the door would become win. To do that, need to create ""door is win."" So find the ""door"" rule, move the ""is"" rule next to it, and then add ""win.""

But the ""door"" rule is at 7 steps right and 2 steps down, while ""win"" is at 9 steps right and 4 steps up. The ""is"" rule is at 3 steps right. So the player would need to move from wherever they are to the ""door"" rule, bring the ""is"" rule there, and then place the ""win"" rule adjacent.

This seems complex, but maybe feasible. Let's outline the steps:

1. Move towards the ""door"" rule at 7 steps right and 2 steps down.
2. Along the way, collect the ""is"" rule at 3 steps right.
3. Once at the ""door"" rule, push the ""is"" rule next to it.
4. Then, bring the ""win"" rule from 9 steps right and 4 steps up down to be adjacent to ""door"" and ""is.""
5. This would create ""door is win,"" making the door a win condition.

But the player's movement is step-by-step, and there are walls and stops to navigate. The ""stop"" rule is at 3 steps up, so moving up might be blocked. The player might need to go around.

Alternatively, focus on creating ""baba is win."" Since the player is Baba, if they can make themselves win, touching anything would be a win. To do that, create ""baba is win"" by placing the ""baba"" rule, ""is,"" and ""win"" adjacent.

The ""baba"" rule is at 1 step left and 2 steps down. The ""is"" rule is at 3 steps right. The ""win"" rule is at 9 steps right and 4 steps up. So the player would need to move from wherever they are to between ""baba"" and ""win,"" bringing the ""is"" rule along.

This seems challenging, but perhaps the player is near the bottom left. Moving right to reach the ""baba"" rule, then up, etc.

Given the time I've spent and the need to choose an action, I'll prioritize moving towards the ""is"" rule to manipulate it. The last valid action was moving left, so maybe moving right towards the ""is"" rule would be better.

I need to figure out the next move in this Baba Is You level. Let's start by looking at the current observation. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I can move Baba around. The goal is usually to reach a ""win"" object, but since rules can be changed, I need to check if there are other possibilities.

Looking at the objects on the map:

- There's a key located 1 step to the right and 3 steps up. Maybe I need to get the key to unlock something, but I'm not sure yet.
- A door is at 1 step to the left and 1 step down. Doors might require a key or some rule alteration to pass through.
- The ""win"" rule is 8 steps to the right and 4 steps up. That's probably the target, but there are walls blocking the direct path.
- There are several ""rule `is`"" blocks scattered around. These are crucial because they define the current rules. If I can move them, I can change the game's rules.

The challenge here is navigating around the walls. The walls are positioned in such a way that moving straight right or up might be blocked. Let me check the positions again:

- Wall 3 steps to the right and 4 steps up: This is blocking the direct path towards the ""win"" object.
- Rule `is` at 7 steps to the right and 4 steps up: Maybe I can move this to create a new rule. For example, if I can make ""baba is win,"" then touching the win object would make me win.

But first, I need to get to the rule `is` blocks. The key is at 1 step right and 3 steps up. If I can reach that key, perhaps I can use it to unlock a door or move other objects. However, moving the key requires that the object it's on isn't blocked by a ""stop"" rule. Looking at the map, there's a ""stop"" rule at 1 step left and 3 steps up. That might prevent moving the key directly. 

Alternatively, maybe I should focus on moving the ""baba"" rule. There's a rule `baba` at 2 steps left and 5 steps down. If I can move that to somewhere else, like next to a ""you"" rule, I could potentially make ""baba is you"" again, but that's already the case. Hmm.

Wait, the active rule is already ""baba is you,"" so maybe I don't need to move that. The key seems important. To get the key, I need to navigate past the walls. Let's see: from my current position, which isn't specified, but based on the objects, I might be positioned somewhere central. Let me assume I'm standing next to the ""baba"" rule at 2 steps left and 5 steps down. If I move right, I can go towards the key. But there's a wall at 3 steps to the right and 1 step up. Maybe I can push the wall if it's not a ""stop"" object. The ""stop"" rule is at 1 step left and 3 steps up, so that's not directly in the way.

Alternatively, maybe I should move one of the ""is"" rules. For instance, the rule `is` at 2 steps to the right. If I move that next to the ""you"" rule at 2 steps down, I could create a new rule like ""you is win,"" making the ""you"" object a win condition. But that might be tricky.

Another approach: Since the door is at 1 step left and 1 step down, and there's a rule `door` at 6 steps right and 2 steps down, perhaps altering the ""door"" rule could help. If I can make ""door is pass"" or something, but I don't have the ""pass"" rule here. 

Wait, the key is at 1 step right and 3 steps up. If I can move towards that, maybe by moving down from where I am. Let's see, the current position isn't specified, but looking at the objects, perhaps I need to move down to reach the key. Alternatively, move right to reach the ""is"" rule at 2 steps right, then rearrange those to create a new rule.

Wait, the active rule is ""baba is you,"" so I can move any object that isn't stopped. The ""stop"" rule is at 1 step left and 3 steps up, so objects near there might be immovable. But most other objects don't have ""stop"" applied. 

Let me think step by step. The immediate goal is probably to reach the ""win"" object at 8 steps right and 4 steps up. But there's a wall blocking that path. To remove the wall, I might need to change the ""wall"" rule. The rule `wall` is at 2 steps left and 3 steps up. If I can move that rule away, then the wall's property would change. For example, if I make ""wall is stop,"" then the walls would become stop signs, which I can't push through. But that might not help. Alternatively, making ""wall is you"" would let me move through walls.

Alternatively, if I can create a rule like ""baba is push,"" then I could push walls. But I don't have the ""push"" rule. 

Another angle: The ""key"" is at 1 step right and 3 steps up. If I can get the key, maybe I can use it on the door. The door is at 1 step left and 1 step down. So moving down from the key's position might lead to the door. But there's a wall at 3 steps right and 1 step up. Maybe I need to move that wall by altering its rule.

Wait, the rule `is` is at 2 steps to the right. If I move that rule next to the ""wall"" rule at 2 steps left, I could create a new rule. For example, moving the `is` to make ""wall is key"" or something. But that might not be useful.

Alternatively, moving the `is` rule next to the ""you"" rule at 2 steps down. If I can make ""you is win,"" then touching the ""you"" object would make me win. But how to position that?

This is getting a bit complicated. Let's try to outline possible steps:

1. Move towards the key at 1 step right and 3 steps up to retrieve it.
2. Use the key on the door at 1 step left and 1 step down, but I'm not sure if there's a rule allowing that.
3. Alter the ""wall"" rule to something else to remove obstacles.
4. Create a new rule that makes Baba able to push walls or bypass them.

Given the current active rule ""baba is you,"" I can move any object that isn't stopped. The ""stop"" is at 1 step left and 3 steps up, so avoiding that area. 

Looking at the positions again:

- Rule `is` at 2 steps to the right. If I move this `is` next to the ""you"" rule at 2 steps down, I can write ""you is win,"" making the ""you"" object a win condition. Then, if I can reach that ""you"" object, I win. But where is the ""you"" rule located? According to the observation, the ""you"" rule is at 2 steps down. So if I can move to that position and combine the `is` there, that might work.

Alternatively, the ""you"" rule is at 5 steps down, as per the observation: ""rule `you` 5 steps down."" Wait, looking back, the observation lists ""rule `you` 5 steps down."" So the ""you"" rule is 5 steps down from the current position. That's quite far. Maybe moving down towards it.

But there's a wall at 3 steps to the right and 5 steps down. Hmm. 

Alternatively, focusing on the ""is"" rule at 2 steps to the right. If I can move that `is` next to the ""you"" rule at 5 steps down, I could create ""you is win."" To do that, I need to navigate down, avoid walls, and rearrange the `is` rule.

But navigating down might be blocked by walls. For example, at 3 steps right and 2 steps down is a wall. So moving down from the current position (assumed to be near the ""baba"" rule at 2 steps left and 5 steps down) might be possible by moving left and then down.

Wait, the ""baba"" rule is at 2 steps left and 5 steps down. So if I'm standing on that, I can move right to get to the `is` rule at 1 step left and 5 steps down. Wait, no, the `is` rule is at 1 step to the left and 5 steps down. So moving left from the ""baba"" rule would reach that `is` rule.

Once I have that `is` rule, I can move it down towards the ""you"" rule at 5 steps down. But there's a wall at 3 steps to the right and 5 steps down. So maybe I need to move that wall by changing its rule. The ""wall"" rule is at 2 steps left and 3 steps up. If I can move that `wall` rule elsewhere, perhaps I can remove the wall blocking the path.

Alternatively, use the key to unlock the door. The key is at 1 step right and 3 steps up. If I can get there, maybe I can move the key to the door's position. But the door is at 1 step left and 1 step down. That's a bit of a journey.

Another possibility: Create a rule that makes ""baba is win."" If I can write that, then touching any ""win"" object would make me win. To do that, I need to move the `is` rule next to ""baba"" and ""win."" The `win` rule is at 8 steps right and 4 steps up. That's quite far, but maybe possible with multiple moves.

But considering the time constraints and the fact that previous actions have been failing, maybe a simpler approach is needed. Let's think about immediate moves.

The latest observation shows after several left and right moves, the position might have shifted. The current active rule is still ""baba is you."" The key is at 1 step right and 3 steps up. If I can move right towards the key, but there's a wall at 3 steps right and 1 step up. Wait, the wall is at 3 steps right and 1 step up from where? The observation lists ""wall 3 steps to the right and 1 step up."" So if I'm at a certain position, moving right three steps and up one would hit a wall. 

Perhaps the best move is to move towards the `is` rule at 2 steps to the right. By moving right twice, I can reach that `is` rule. Then, move it down to combine with the ""you"" rule at 2 steps down. That would create ""you is win,"" making the ""you"" object a win condition. 

To do that, I need to:

1. Move right twice to reach the `is` rule at 2 steps right.
2. Move down once to position the `is` next to the ""you"" rule at 2 steps down.
3. Then, the new rule ""you is win"" would make touching the ""you"" object win the game.

Alternatively, if I can reach the ""you"" rule at 5 steps down, but that's further away.

Given the current position isn't specified, but based on previous actions, maybe the agent is near the `is` rule at 2 steps to the right. So moving down from there would be optimal.

Another angle: The door is at 1 step left and 1 step down. If I can open the door by changing its rule, maybe to ""door is pass."" But I need the ""pass"" rule, which I don't have. However, there's a ""key"" nearby. Maybe using the key on the door requires a rule like ""key is open,"" but that's not present here.

In conclusion, the most feasible approach seems to be moving the `is` rule next to the ""you"" rule to create ""you is win."" To do this, the agent needs to navigate to the `is` rule, move it down, and place it next to the ""you"" rule. 

So the next action should be to move down from the current position to reach the `is` rule and then move it further down towards the ""you"" rule. However, given the previous actions have been left and right, maybe the agent is getting stuck. Alternatively, moving down step by step.

Wait, the latest observation after several left and right moves shows the agent is now at a position where moving right leads to the `is` rule at 4 steps to the right. Wait, no, in the last observation before the current one, the agent was moving right and ended up at a position where the door is 1 step down. 

This is getting a bit confusing without knowing the agent's exact position. But based on the objects listed, the key action is to manipulate the `is` rules to create a winning condition. 

Therefore, the best action is to move down towards the `is` rule at 2 steps to the right and 2 steps down, positioning it next to the ""you"" rule to create ""you is win.""

Let's take a look at the current situation in the Baba Is You game. The active rule is still ""baba is you,"" which means whatever I do, I can manipulate the rules by moving text blocks. The goal is usually to become ""win,"" but I need to check if that's still the case or if it's been changed.

Looking at the objects on the map:

- There's a door at 1 step to the left. Doors are typically something you need to open to progress, but right now, the rule for door is at 6 steps to the right and 1 step down. Wait, the door's position is 1 step to the left, but the rule defining door is elsewhere. Maybe the door isn't currently passable unless there's a ""key"" rule nearby or another rule allowing it.

- There's a key at 1 step to the right and 4 step up. I need to get to that key, but the path might be blocked by walls. The walls are clustered to the right and up, so moving towards the key might require navigating around them.

- The ""you"" rule is at 1 step down. Since ""baba is you,"" if I can move the ""you"" text block onto Baba, then I would be defined as ""you,"" but I think ""baba is you"" already makes Baba the player. Maybe the goal is to reach the door, which is defined as ""win,"" but the current active rules don't have a ""win"" rule. Wait, looking back, there's a rule `win` at 8 steps to the right and 4 step up. But how do I get there?

- The door is at 1 step to the left. If I can make the door become ""win,"" then stepping on it would win the level. To do that, I need to move the ""win"" text block to the door's location. But the ""win"" rule is currently at 8 steps to the right and 4 step up. To move it, I need to pick it up and carry it, but I can only move objects that aren't ""stop."" Are any of the walls or rules stoppable? The ""stop"" rule is at 1 step to the left and 4 step up, so maybe moving around that.

Alternatively, maybe I can change the door's property. If I can make the door be ""win,"" then touching it would make me win. To do that, I need to move the ""win"" rule to the door's position. But the door is at 1 step to the left, so I need to bring the ""win"" rule there. However, moving the ""win"" rule requires moving it step by step, possibly by moving it left past the obstacles.

Looking at the current positions:

- The ""win"" rule is at 8 steps right and 4 up. The door is at 1 step left. So the distance is quite far. I need to find a path to move the ""win"" rule leftwards. The walls are at 3 steps right in various positions, so maybe there's a path around them.

Alternatively, maybe there's another way. If I can make Baba into ""win,"" then just being Baba would make me win. To do that, I need to move the ""win"" text block onto Baba. But where is Baba located? Looking at the objects, there's a rule `baba` at 2 steps left and 1 step down. So the Baba object is at 2 steps left and 1 step down. If I can move the ""win"" rule to that position, then ""baba is win"" would make touching Baba win the game.

But how to get there? The current active rule is ""baba is you,"" so I can manipulate other rules. The ""win"" rule is at 8 right, 4 up. I need to move it left to 2 left and 1 down. That's quite a distance. Alternatively, maybe there's a shorter path. Let me check the positions again.

The ""is"" rule is at various places. For example, rule `is` is at 7 right, 4 up; another at 2 right, 1 up; and others lower down. Maybe I can use those ""is"" rules to create new rules by moving them with the ""win"" rule.

Wait, the key is at 1 right, 4 up. Maybe I need to get that key first to unlock something. But the key is behind walls. The path from my current position (assuming I'm at the starting point, which isn't specified, but looking at the rules and objects, perhaps I'm in the center) to the key is blocked by walls. So I need to move around the walls to reach the key.

But since I can move text blocks, maybe I can use them to create passages. For example, if I can turn a wall into a stop by redefining its property, but that might not help. Alternatively, create a rule that makes a wall pushable or removable.

Alternatively, the ""stop"" rule is at 1 left and 4 up. If I can move that, maybe I can remove obstacles. But ""stop"" objects can't be moved, right? Wait, no. The tip says you can only move objects or text that are not defined as ""STOP"" or similar immovable properties. So if something is ""stop,"" you can't move it. But the ""stop"" rule itself is a text block. So if I can move the ""stop"" text block, I can then use it to block or unblock paths.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is a text block that says ""stop."" So moving that text block would redefine what is ""stop."" For example, if I move the ""stop"" rule to a wall, then that wall would become stop. Or if I move it elsewhere, it might remove the stop property from something.

This is getting complicated. Let me try to outline possible steps:

1. Move the ""win"" rule to the door's location to make the door win.
2. Move the ""win"" rule to Baba's location to make Baba win.
3. Use the key to unlock a door, but the key is behind walls.
4. Manipulate the ""you"" rule to ensure I'm correctly defined as the player.

Looking at the current objects, the ""you"" rule is at 2 steps down. Since ""baba is you"" is active, maybe that's already set. But perhaps there's a conflict. If I can move the ""you"" rule onto Baba, it might reinforce it.

Alternatively, if the door is the win condition, I need to get to it. But the door is at 1 step left. To get there, I might need to push or move walls out of the way. However, walls are ""stop,"" so I can't move them. But text blocks that define walls (like the ""wall"" rule at 2 left) can be moved. So if I move the ""wall"" rule, I can change where the walls are.

For example, there's a rule `wall` at 2 step to the left. If I move that rule away, the wall at that position would disappear. Similarly, other walls are defined by their respective ""wall"" rules. So by moving those rules, I can remove walls.

The goal `win` is at 8 right, 4 up. The door is at 1 left. So maybe the intended path is to move the ""win"" rule to the door. But how?

Alternatively, since the door is at 1 left, and there's a rule `door` at 6 right and 1 down, maybe I can replace that rule with ""win"" to make the door be win. But the door's current rule is at 6 right, 1 down. If I can move the ""win"" rule there, then the door would become win.

To do that, I need to navigate the ""win"" rule from 8 right,4 up to 6 right,1 down. The path between them is blocked by walls. For example, at 3 steps right in various positions. So I need to move the ""win"" rule left past the walls. But how?

Maybe by moving other text blocks out of the way. For example, the ""is"" rule at 7 right,4 up could be moved left to help create a path. But this requires careful planning.

Alternatively, focus on getting the key at 1 right,4 up. If I can reach the key, perhaps it opens a door or allows me to move other blocks. But the key is behind walls. The path from the key to the starting area is blocked by walls at 3 right,3 step up, etc. So maybe I need to remove those walls by moving their ""wall"" rules.

The ""wall"" rule is at 2 left. If I move that to another position, the wall at 2 left would disappear. But how to get to that ""wall"" rule? It's 2 steps left, which is directly left from the current position. But there's a ""stop"" rule at 1 left and4 up, which might be blocking the path.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at 1 left and4 up. If I can move that ""stop"" rule, then perhaps I can move through the area. But ""stop"" objects can't be moved, but the text block ""stop"" is a movable object unless it's defined as stop. Wait, the rule is ""stop,"" so the text block ""stop"" is an object that's stop. So I can't move it. That complicates things.

So, the immediate obstacles are the walls and the ""stop"" rule. To move the ""win"" rule to the door, need to find a path around the walls. Alternatively, use the ""is"" rules to create new rules that allow movement.

Another approach: Since ""baba is you,"" maybe I can turn myself into ""win"" by moving the ""win"" rule onto Baba. Baba's rule is at 2 left,1 down. The ""win"" rule is at8 right,4 up. So the distance is significant. But maybe I can move the ""win"" rule left by moving it through the available ""is"" rules.

For example, move the ""win"" rule left step by step, using the ""is"" rules as intermediaries. Each time I move the ""win"" rule left, I might need to adjust the ""is"" rules to maintain the connection.

Alternatively, use the key to unlock a door, but the door at 1 left is the main door. The key is at1 right,4 up. To get there, I need to navigate past the walls. Let's see:

From the current position (assuming I'm at the center), moving right would hit walls at 3 steps right in various positions. Maybe there's a path upwards or downwards.

Alternatively, move the ""is"" rule at7 right,4 up to create a new rule that allows movement. For example, create ""baba is push"" or something, but that's speculative.

This is quite complex. Let me try to prioritize:

1. Get the key to open the door.
2. Use the key to move a block or change a rule.
3. Make the door into ""win.""

But without knowing the layout precisely, it's hard. Let me try to visualize based on the observations.

The latest observation shows the door at 1 step to the left. The ""win"" rule is far to the right. The ""baba"" rule is at 2 left,1 down. The ""you"" rule is at2 down. The ""key"" is at1 right,4 up.

Possible steps:

- Move down to reach the key area. But the path might be blocked.

Wait, in the latest observation, the door is at1 step to the left. If I move left from my current position, I might reach the door. But there's a wall at5 right,4 up, etc. Maybe I'm positioned somewhere in the middle.

Alternatively, focus on moving the ""win"" rule to the door. To do that, need to move it left from8 right,4 up to1 left. That's a lot of steps left. But perhaps by moving the ""win"" rule left through the grid, step by step, using the ""is"" rules to facilitate movement.

Each time I move the ""win"" rule left, I need to ensure that I'm not blocked by walls. The walls are at3 steps right in various positions. So moving left from8 right would pass through positions7 right, then6 right, etc., until reaching1 left.

But along the way, there are other objects and rules. For example, at4 steps right, there's a rule `is`, a wall, etc. So I need to navigate around those.

Alternatively, use the ""is"" rules to create a path. For example, create a rule that makes a wall pushable, but I'm not sure.

Another idea: The ""key"" is at1 right,4 up. If I can get that key, then perhaps I can use it to move a blocked door. But the door at1 left is separate from the key.

Alternatively, make the key into a ""win"" rule. If I can move the ""win"" rule onto the key's position, then the key would be win. But the key is an object, not a rule. So maybe that's not possible.

Wait, the key is an object, but rules are text blocks. So to change the key's property, I need to create a rule like ""key is win."" But the current active rules don't have that. So if I can create such a rule by moving the ""win"" and ""key"" text blocks together with an ""is"" rule.

For example, move the ""is"" rule next to the ""key"" and ""win"" rules to form ""key is win."" Then stepping on the key would make you win. But the key is at1 right,4 up, and the ""win"" rule is at8 right,4 up. So I need to move both the ""key"" and ""win"" rules to be adjacent, using the ""is"" rule in between.

This seems possible but requires careful movement.

Alternatively, since ""baba is you,"" maybe I can push blocks. But the tip says you can only move objects or text that are not ""STOP"" or similar. The walls are ""STOP,"" so I can't push them. But text blocks that define stop (like the ""stop"" rule) can be moved.

So, if I can move the ""stop"" rule away, then the walls that are defined by it might become passable. For example, the ""stop"" rule is at1 left and4 up. If I move that rule elsewhere, the wall at that position (which is defined by the ""stop"" rule) might no longer be stop, allowing me to pass.

But how to move the ""stop"" rule? Since it's a text block, unless it's defined as stop, I can move it. But the ""stop"" rule itself is a text block that says ""stop,"" which makes any object with that rule become stop. So moving the ""stop"" text block would just move the rule, not the property. Wait, no. The property is determined by the text blocks' positions. For example, if there's a ""wall"" text block at a certain position, then that position is a wall. Similarly, a ""stop"" text block at a position makes that position stop.

So moving the ""stop"" text block from1 left,4 up to another position would mean that the new position is now stop, and the old position is no longer stop. So if I can move the ""stop"" rule away from the wall, the wall might become passable.

This could be a way to remove obstacles. For example, if a wall is at3 steps right, and the ""stop"" rule is at1 left,4 up, moving the ""stop"" rule to3 right would make that position stop, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, move it to a position where it doesn't block the path.

But this requires knowing the exact layout. Given the current observations, perhaps the best approach is to try to move the ""win"" rule towards the door by left movements, step by step, using the available ""is"" rules to help.

Alternatively, since the user is Baba and ""baba is you,"" maybe combining rules to make Baba win. For example, create ""baba is win"" by moving the ""win"" rule next to Baba's rule. Baba's rule is at2 left,1 down. The ""win"" rule is at8 right,4 up. The distance is vast, but perhaps possible by moving the ""win"" rule leftward.

Each step left would require moving the ""win"" rule one step, possibly by pushing it with other text blocks or moving around. But given the walls, this might take many steps.

Alternatively, look for a shorter path. For example, move the ""win"" rule down to the lower part of the map where there are fewer walls. The door is at1 step left, which is in the lower part. So moving the ""win"" rule down and then left might be easier.

In the latest observation, the ""win"" rule is at8 right,4 up. Moving down to4 step down would place it at8 right,0 (assuming up is positive y). Then moving left to1 left would be possible if the path is clear.

But along the way, there are walls at3 steps right in various positions. For example, at3 right,4 up; 3 right,3 up; etc. So moving the ""win"" rule down from8 right,4 up to8 right,0 would pass through positions8 right,3 up;8 right,2 up; etc., which might be clear if there are no walls there.

Looking at the objects, the walls are at3 steps right in various positions, but not at8 right. So moving the ""win"" rule down to8 right,0 should be possible, then left to1 left.

Once the ""win"" rule is at1 left, which is where the door is, then the door would become ""win,"" allowing me to step on it to win.

So the steps would be:

1. Move the ""win"" rule from8 right,4 up down to8 right,0 (assuming down is possible without walls).
2. Move the ""win"" rule left from8 right,0 to1 left.

But to do this, I need to ensure that there are no walls blocking the path. From8 right,4 up, moving down to8 right,3 up; check if there's a wall. In the current observation, the walls at3 steps right are at various positions, but not at8 right. So moving down should be possible.

Then moving left from8 right,0 to7 right,0;6 right,0;... until reaching1 left,0.

This seems feasible. So the chosen action would be to move left repeatedly until the ""win"" rule is at the door's position.

But how to execute this in the game? Each time I move left, I'm moving the ""win"" rule left one step. So I need to issue ""left"" actions multiple times until it reaches the door.

Given that the last action was ""down"" and the observation updated accordingly, the next step would be to continue moving left","

56,Failed to obtain a valid action from the reasoning.,"<reasoning>
Let me try to figure out what to do here. The active rule is still ""baba is you,"" which means I can move like Baba or any object that's tied to me through other rules. The goal is usually to reach the ""win"" condition, which is probably the door or something else labeled as win.

Looking at the objects on the map:

- There's a door at 1 step to the left. But doors are usually stop unless there's a rule saying ""door is push"" or something. Wait, there's a rule `door` at 6 steps to the right and 1 step down. Not sure how that helps yet.

- There's a key at 1 step to the right and 4 step up. But I need to check if I can reach it. The path might be blocked by walls. Let's see the walls: there are walls at various positions, mostly to the right and up. So moving up to get the key might be possible, but I need to navigate around the walls.

- The key is at 1 step right and 4 steps up. My current position isn't clear, but looking at the other objects, like the rule `is` at 7 steps right and 5 steps up, maybe I'm somewhere in the middle. Let me visualize the grid.

Wait, the observation lists objects relative to the player's position. So ""wall 3 steps to the right and 5 step up"" means there's a wall northeast of me. The ""rule `is`"" at 7 right and 5 up is even further in that direction. The ""win"" rule is at 8 right and 5 up, so that's the target maybe? But how do I get there?

The door is at 1 step left, which is south of me. But if the door is a stop, I can't push it. Unless there's a way to change the door's property. Also, there's a `rule `door` at 6 right and 1 down. Maybe if I can move that rule to say ""door is win"" or something, but that requires manipulating text blocks.

But first, I need to see if I can reach the door. The door is 1 step left. Am I currently facing right? If I move left, would that get me to the door? But there's a wall at 3 steps right and 5 up, but that's not in the left direction. Wait, the walls are more to the right and up. The door is left, so maybe the path is clear?

Wait, the door is at 1 step left. So if I move left once, I reach the door. But is the door a stop? By default, doors are stop, so I can't pass through. Unless there's a rule that says ""door is not stop"" or ""door is you."" But the current active rule is only ""baba is you."" So the door is stop, meaning I can't move into it. So moving left into the door would do nothing.

Hmm. Then maybe the key is necessary. The key is at 1 right, 4 up. Let's see if I can get there. To go up 4 steps, but there are walls at 3 steps right and 4 up, 3 steps right and 3 up, etc. So the path up is blocked by walls. Unless I can move the walls by repositioning rules.

Wait, the rules are on the map. For example, there's a `rule `wall` at 2 step left and 3 step up. If I can move that rule, maybe I can remove the wall blocking my path. But to move a rule, I need to be able to push it, which requires it not being a stop. The rule itself isn't necessarily stop; it's the object it's defining that's stop. So if a rule is `wall is stop`, then the wall is stop. But the current active rule is just ""baba is you,"" so other rules might be in effect.

Wait, the active rules are only ""baba is you"" as per the observation. So other rules like ""wall is stop"" are probably still present but not active? No, in Baba Is You, the active rules are the ones that are currently on the board. The observation lists all objects, including rules. So the active rules are the ones that are currently being used. For example, if there's a rule ""wall is stop,"" that's an active rule. But in the current observation, the active rules listed are just ""baba is you."" Wait, no—the ""Active rules"" section lists the currently active rules. So in this case, the only active rule is ""baba is you."" All other rules (like ""wall is stop"") are present on the map but not active unless they're formed by combining subjects and properties.

Wait, no. In Baba Is You, the active rules are the ones that are on the board and can be manipulated. For example, if there's a text block ""WALL IS STOP"" on the map, that's an active rule. But in the current observation, the Active rules section says only ""baba is you."" So all other rules (like wall is stop) must not be present on the board anymore, or they're inactive. Wait, no—the observation lists all objects on the map, including text blocks. Let me check the Objects on the map:

Looking at the objects:

- There's a rule `wall` at 2 step left and 3 step up.

- rule `stop` at 1 step left and 3 step up.

- rule `is` at various positions.

So those are text blocks on the map. So the active rules are the ones formed by combining subjects and properties. For example, if there's a text block ""WALL"" and a text block ""IS STOP"" adjacent, then the rule ""WALL IS STOP"" is active. But in the current observation, the Active rules section only shows ""baba is you."" So that means that all other potential rules (like WALL IS STOP) are not currently active because their constituent text blocks are not adjacent.

So the current active rule is only ""baba is you,"" which means I can move freely (as Baba) unless blocked by STOP objects. The STOP objects are those that have the ""STOP"" property active. But if the ""WALL IS STOP"" rule is not active, then walls are just regular walls that I can push or move past if possible.

Wait, but in Baba Is You, even if a rule like ""WALL IS STOP"" isn't active, the wall itself is an object. But if there's no rule making it stop, can I move through it? I think walls are solid by default unless there's a rule saying they're not. But according to the game mechanics, objects like walls are stop by default unless a rule overrides that. However, in this case, since the only active rule is ""baba is you,"" and there's no active ""wall is stop"" rule, does that mean walls can be moved over?

This is a bit confusing. Let me think again. In Baba Is You, each object has certain properties based on the active rules. If there's a text block ""WALL"" and a text block ""IS STOP"" adjacent, then the rule ""WALL IS STOP"" is active, making walls act as stoppers. If those text blocks are separated, then the rule isn't active, and walls might not be stop.

In the current observation, the rule `wall` is at 2 left and 3 up, and rule `stop` is at 1 left and 3 up. These are two separate text blocks. To form the rule ""WALL IS STOP,"" they need to be adjacent. Since they're not (one is at 2 left 3 up, the other at 1 left 3 up), they are not adjacent. Therefore, the ""WALL IS STOP"" rule is not active. So walls are not stop, meaning I can move through them? Or can I push them?

Wait, in Baba Is You, you can only move objects that are not defined as ""STOP."" So if a wall is not under a ""STOP"" rule, you can push it. But in this case, since there's no active ""WALL IS STOP"" rule, the walls are not stop, so I can move around them or push them if possible.

So, going back to the key. The key is at 1 step right and 4 step up. The path up is blocked by walls, but if those walls aren't stop, maybe I can move around them. Let me check the path:

From my current position, to reach the key at (1 right, 4 up), I need to move up 4 steps and right 1. But there are walls at 3 right and 4 up, 3 right and 3 up, etc. These are wall objects. Since their ""STOP"" property isn't active, I can move through them? Or can I push them?

Wait, to push a wall, I need to be adjacent to it and move in the direction opposite to where I want to push it. For example, if I'm to the left of a wall and move right, I can push it to the right. But if the wall is not stop, I can also move past it.

But in this case, the walls are in the way. Let's see the positions:

If I need to go up 4 steps and right 1, but there's a wall at 3 right and 4 up. My current position isn't clear, but assuming I'm somewhere in the lower part of the map. Let's say I'm at position (0,0). Then the wall at 3 right and 4 up is at (3,4). The key is at (1,4). So the path from (0,0) to (1,4) would require moving up 4 steps and right 1. But between (0,4) and (1,4), there's a wall at (3,4), which is further right. So maybe the path is clear to the key.

Wait, no. The wall at 3 right and 4 up is at (3,4), which is to the right of the key at (1,4). So moving from (0,0) up to (0,4), then right to (1,4), there's no wall in between. The wall at (3,4) is to the right of the key. So maybe I can reach the key by moving up to (0,4), then right to (1,4). But is there a wall blocking that?

Looking at the objects, there's a wall at 3 steps right and 4 step up, which is (3,4), and another at 3 right and 3 up (3,3), etc. So between (0,4) and (1,4), there's no wall mentioned. So maybe that path is clear.

Once I have the key, I can use it to unlock the door. The door is at 1 step left, which is ( -1, 0) if I'm at (0,0). But the door is a stop unless there's a rule allowing passage. However, the door's rule is at 6 right and 1 down, which is (6,-1). Not sure how that helps. Unless I can move that rule near the door to change its property.

Alternatively, if I can reach the door and there's a rule that says ""door is you"" or ""door is win,"" but currently, the only active rule is ""baba is you."" So the door is a stop, but if I can make it not a stop, I could pass through.

Wait, the door is at 1 step left. If I move left to reach it, but it's a stop, I can't. So maybe I need to change the door's property. How? By moving the rule `door` somewhere near the door and combining it with another property.

For example, if I can move the `door` text block next to the `win` text block, then the rule ""DOOR IS WIN"" would be created, making the door the win condition. That would let me step on it to win.

But to do that, I need to move the `door` rule. The `door` rule is at 6 steps right and 1 step down. My current position is unknown, but assuming I'm somewhere in the lower left part of the map, moving right and down might be necessary.

Alternatively, if I can push the `door` rule to the area where the `win` rule is. The `win` rule is at 8 steps right and 5 steps up. That's quite far. Maybe there's a smarter way.

Alternatively, maybe I can make myself a key by creating a rule ""baba is key."" If I can move the `key` text block next to the `baba` text block, that would create the rule ""BABA IS KEY,"" which might allow me to pick up the key without moving to its location.

Looking at the objects, there's a `rule `key` at 7 steps right and 1 step up. And there's a `rule `baba` at 2 steps left and 2 steps down. If I can move the `key` rule near the `baba` rule, then they would form ""BABA IS KEY,"" making me a key. Then I could potentially pick up the key automatically, but I'm not sure if that works in the game.

Alternatively, if I become a key, maybe I can unlock the door. But the door is a stop unless there's a rule saying ""door is key"" or something. Not sure.

Alternatively, focus on getting the key first. To get the key at 1 right, 4 up, I need to move up 4 steps and right 1. Assuming I can move through walls (since they're not stop), I can go up to (0,4), then right to (1,4), pick up the key. Then, with the key, maybe I can push a door or something.

But how do I pick up the key? In Baba Is You, you can only move objects that are not stop. If the key is not stop, I can pick it up by moving into it. Once I have the key, I might be able to use it on a door that requires a key.

Looking at the door's position: it's at 1 step left. There's also a `rule `door` at 6 right and 1 down. If I can move that `door` rule next to the door object, maybe I can change its property. For example, if I make ""DOOR IS WIN,"" then stepping on the door would win the level.

But to do that, I need to move the `door` rule text block to be adjacent to the door object. The door object is at 1 left, and the `door` rule is at 6 right and 1 down. That's quite far. Maybe there's a way to push the `door` rule towards the door.

Alternatively, use the key to unlock something. If the door requires a key, and I have the key, then stepping on the door would win. But how do I know if the door is key-locked? In the game, doors can be locked with keys, which requires the key to be present in the level. If I have the key, I might be able to push the door if it's not stop.

Wait, doors are usually stop unless there's a rule saying otherwise. So even with the key, if the door is stop, I can't pass. But maybe having the key allows me to move the door rule. For example, if the door is pushed, it might move if it's not stop.

This is getting a bit complicated. Let's recap:

- Goal: Reach the win condition, likely the door or the `win` rule.

- Current active rule: ""baba is you.""

- Key is at 1 right, 4 up. Path might be clear.

- Door is at 1 left, but it's stop unless rules say otherwise.

- `door` rule is at 6 right, 1 down. Maybe move that near the door to change its property.

Possible steps:

1. Move to the key's location (1 right, 4 up) to pick it up.

2. Use the key to unlock the door.

3. Move to the door and pass through it.

But how to move to the key? Need to navigate up and right, avoiding walls. Assuming walls are not stop, I can move through them.

Alternatively, if walls are stop, I can't. But earlier analysis suggests that without the ""WALL IS STOP"" rule, walls are not stop. So I can move around them.

So moving up 4 steps and right 1 step to reach the key. Let's see:

From my current position (unknown), but assuming I'm at the bottom left, moving up to (0,4), then right to (1,4) to get the key.

Once I have the key, I need to get to the door at 1 left. But the door is stop, so I can't move into it. So I need to change the door's rule.

The `door` rule is at 6 right, 1 down. To move it near the door at 1 left, I need to push it left and down. But how?

If I can push the `door` rule, I need to be adjacent to it and move in the direction opposite to where I want to push it. For example, if I'm to the left of the `door` rule, moving right would push it right. But the `door` rule is at 6 right, 1 down. My current position is unknown, but if I'm at (1,4) after getting the key, I need to move to the `door` rule's location at (6,-1), which seems far.

Alternatively, maybe there's a shorter path. Let's see the positions again:

- `door` rule: 6 right, 1 down.

- Door object: 1 left.

So the `door` rule is much farther than the door object. To move the `door` rule next to the door, I need to push it left and up. But how?

If I can reach the `door` rule at (6,-1), maybe by moving right and down from my current position. But this seems complicated.

Alternatively, focus on creating a ""door is win"" rule. To do that, I need the `door` text block and the `win` text block adjacent. The `win` rule is at 8 right, 5 up. The `door` rule is at 6 right, 1 down. These are quite far apart. It might not be feasible.

Another approach: Make Baba a win by creating ""baba is win."" To do that, move the `win` rule next to the `baba` rule. The `baba` rule is at 2 left and 2 down, and the `win` rule is at 8 right, 5 up. That's a long distance. Maybe not possible.

Alternatively, create ""you is win,"" but the active rule is ""baba is you,"" so if I can make ""you is win,""","

57,down,"<reasoning>
The current observation shows that ""Baba is you"". The active rules are still the same as the previous steps. The objects on the map include several walls, a door, a key, and some rules scattered around.

First, I need to figure out the player's position. But looking at the objects, there's no explicit information about where ""Baba"" is. However, since the rule ""baba is you"" is active, maybe the player is controlling the Baba object. But where is Baba located?

The objects list the door at 1 step to the left and some walls and rules below. There's also a ""rule `you`"" at 1 step down. Since the player is Baba, maybe I need to reach that ""you"" rule to reinforce it. Alternatively, maybe I need to move the ""you"" rule to make Baba the win condition.

Looking at the active rules, ""Baba is you"" is present. The ""win"" rule is 8 steps to the right and 5 steps up, which is probably out of reach. There's a key nearby at 1 step to the right and 4 steps up. But moving towards the key might not be necessary right now.

The door is 1 step to the left, but it's blocked by walls. Wait, the door's position is 1 step to the left, but there's a wall 3 steps to the right. Maybe the door is on the left side of the player. However, the ""stop"" rule is at 1 step to the left and 4 steps up, which might make that area immovable.

The ""rule `you`"" is at 1 step down. If I can move that ""you"" rule to combine with ""Baba"", perhaps I can make ""Baba you"" which would mean I can move through walls or other obstacles. Let me check the positions. The ""rule `you`"" is 1 step down, and there's a ""rule `is`"" at 1 step to the left and 1 step down. Maybe I need to move the ""you"" rule down further to combine it with ""Baba"".

But how do I move the rules? The player (Baba) needs to be able to push or move the text blocks. The active rules don't have any ""push"" or ""move"" properties yet. Since ""Baba is you"", I can move the text blocks that are not stopped. The ""stop"" rule is at 1 step to the left and 4 steps up, so that block can't be moved. But other rules like ""is"", ""win"", ""wall"", ""key"", and ""door"" might be movable if they're not labeled as stop.

Looking at the current objects, the ""rule `you`"" is at 1 step down. To move it, I need to be adjacent to it. If I move down once, I can pick up the ""you"" rule and then move it somewhere else, like next to ""Baba"" to create ""Baba IS YOU"" again, but that's already the case. Alternatively, move the ""you"" rule to combine with another rule.

Wait, there's a ""rule `is`"" at 1 step to the left and 1 step down. If I can move the ""you"" rule next to that ""is"" rule, I could create a new rule like ""you is [something]"". But the goal is usually to make ""Baba"" the ""win"" condition. So maybe I need to move the ""win"" rule closer or change the ""win"" rule to be Baba.

Another approach: The ""door"" is probably the exit, but it's a ""door"" which might be a stop unless changed. If I can make ""door is win"", then stepping on the door would make it a win condition. But to do that, I need to move the ""win"" rule next to the ""door"" and the ""is"" rule.

Alternatively, since ""Baba is you"", maybe I can move the ""you"" rule to be under ""Baba"" to reinforce it, but that might not help. Let me think about the positions again.

The ""rule `you`"" is at 1 step down. If I can move down to grab it, then move it to where the ""baba"" rule is (which is at 2 steps left and 4 steps down, according to previous observations). Wait, in the current observation, the ""rule `baba`"" is at 2 steps left and 1 step down. So if I move down to the ""you"" rule, pick it up, then move left to combine with ""baba"" and ""is"".

So the steps could be: move down to get the ""you"" rule, then left to reach the ""baba"" and ""is"" rules, then create ""baba is you"" again (which is already there) but perhaps move the ""you"" next to ""baba"" and ""is"" to make ""baba is you"" a rule. But I'm not sure if that's necessary.

Alternatively, move the ""win"" rule to be under ""door"" and ""is"" to make ""door is win"". That way, stepping on the door would win the level. The ""win"" rule is currently at 8 steps right and 5 steps up. That's quite far. Maybe there's a way to move it down.

But how to move the ""win"" rule? The player needs to be adjacent to it and move towards it, but there are walls blocking the path. The walls are at 3 steps right and various ups. So maybe navigating around the walls to get to the ""win"" rule is impossible. Therefore, perhaps the solution is to manipulate the existing rules closer.

Another angle: The ""key"" is at 1 step right and 4 steps up. Maybe picking up the key isn't necessary, but if there's a lock somewhere, the key could be used. However, there's no lock mentioned in the current observation.

Looking back, the ""door"" is 1 step to the left. If I can make the door a stop, then it becomes a wall, but that might not help. Alternatively, making the door a win condition.

Wait, the active rules are still ""baba is you"". To change the win condition, I need to move the ""win"" rule next to the door and an ""is"" rule. For example, if there's an ""is"" rule adjacent to the door and the ""win"" rule, then the door becomes win. But the ""win"" rule is currently high up. Maybe I need to move it down.

But how? The player has to move towards the ""win"" rule, but there are walls blocking the path. The walls are at 3 steps right and various positions. So perhaps the player needs to move left or right to get around the walls.

Wait, the player's position isn't explicitly given. But the rules and objects are positioned relative to the player. For example, ""wall 3 steps to the right and 4 step up"" implies the player is somewhere to the left and below that wall.

Assuming the player is near the lower left area, given the ""door"" is 1 step to the left and the ""rule `baba`"" is 2 steps left and 1 step down. So the player might be at position (0,0), and the door is at (-1,0), the ""baba"" rule is at (-2,-1), etc.

If that's the case, then to reach the ""win"" rule at (8,5), that's far to the right and up. Not feasible. So maybe the solution is to create a new rule that makes the door win.

To do that, I need to move the ""win"" rule to be next to the door and an ""is"" rule. The ""door"" is at (-1,0), and there's a ""rule `door`"" at (6,1). Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, use the existing ""is"" rule at (1 step to the left and 1 step down) which is at (-1,-1). If I can move the ""win"" rule to be next to the door and that ""is"" rule, then ""door is win"" would be created.

But the ""win"" rule is at (8,5), which is far away. Maybe there's a different approach.

Wait, the ""key"" is at (1,4). If I can pick up the key and use it to unlock something, but there's no lock mentioned. Maybe the key is a red herring.

Back to the ""rule `you`"" at (1,-1). If I can move that to be next to the ""baba"" rule and an ""is"" rule, creating ""baba is you"" again, but that's already the case. Maybe combining ""you"" with another rule.

Alternatively, create a rule like ""you is win"", making the player (Baba, who is you) the win condition. To do that, I need to move the ""win"" rule next to ""you"" and an ""is"" rule.

The ""win"" rule is at (8,5). The ""you"" rule is at (1,-1). The ""is"" rule is at (-1,-1). So the path from ""win"" to ""you"" is blocked by walls. Not possible.

Another Idea: Since the player is Baba and ""Baba is you"", maybe moving the ""you"" rule onto the ""Baba"" entity to reinforce the rule. But the ""rule `baba`"" is at (-2,-1), and the ""you"" rule is at (1,-1). So moving left from the ""you"" rule to reach the ""baba"" and ""is"" rules.

So the steps could be:

1. Move down to the ""you"" rule (1 step down from current position).
2. Pick up the ""you"" rule.
3. Move left twice to reach the ""baba"" rule at (-2,-1).
4. Place the ""you"" rule next to the ""baba"" and ""is"" rule to create ""baba is you"" (but that's redundant).
5. Alternatively, move the ""you"" rule to another location to combine with other rules.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, move the ""is"" rule to be next to ""you"" and ""win"" to create ""you is win"".

But the ""is"" rule is at (-1,-1). The ""you"" is at (1,-1). Moving the ""is"" rule to the right to be between ""you"" and ""win"" might not be possible due to walls.

Alternatively, look for the ""rule `is`"" that's at (2 steps to the right and 1 step up) in previous observations. Wait, in the current observation, the ""rule `is`"" is at 2 steps to the right and 1 step up. So maybe that's a different ""is"" rule.

Wait, the current observation lists ""rule `is` 2 steps to the right and 1 step up"". So if I can move that ""is"" rule next to the ""you"" rule and the ""win"" rule, then ""you is win"" would be created, making the player (you) the win condition.

But the ""win"" rule is at (8,5), which is far away. The ""is"" rule is at (2,1), and the ""you"" rule is at (1,-1). So the path from (2,1) to (1,-1) is possible if there are no walls in between. But the walls are at 3 steps right and various positions. So maybe moving left from the ""is"" rule at (2,1) to reach the ""you"" rule at (1,-1) is possible.

But the player's position is unclear. Assuming the player is near the ""baba"" rule at (-2,-1), moving right to reach the ""is"" rule at (2,1) would require moving through several walls. The walls are at 3 steps right and various ups, which might block the path.

Alternatively, maybe the solution is to move the ""key"" rule to somewhere, but I don't see how that helps.

Another angle: The door is at 1 step to the left. If I can make the door a stop, then it becomes a wall, but that's not helpful. If I can make the door a win, then stepping on it would win. To do that, need ""door is win"".

The ""door"" is at (-1,0), and there's a ""rule `door`"" at (6,1). The ""win"" rule is at (8,5). The ""is"" rule is at (2,1) and (-1,-1).

So maybe move the ""win"" rule down to be next to the door and an ""is"" rule. But how? The player would need to move the ""win"" rule, which is high up, down past the walls. That seems impossible.

Wait, perhaps the solution is simpler. Since the player is Baba and ""Baba is you"", maybe the player can push the door if it's not stopped. But the door's type isn't specified. If the door is not stopped, then pushing it might move it, but the goal is to reach the win condition, which is likely the door.

Alternatively, if the door is a stop, then the player can't move through it. But if the player can change the door's property to win, then walking into it would win.

To change the door's property, need to create ""door is win"". To do that, need the ""win"" rule next to the door and an ""is"" rule.

The ""win"" rule is at (8,5), the door is at (-1,0), and there's an ""is"" rule at (-1,-1). So perhaps moving the ""is"" rule up to be next to the door and the ""win"" rule.

But again, the path is blocked by walls.

Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let's look for the nearest movable objects. The ""key"" is at (1,4), but I don't see a lock. The ""you"" rule is at (1,-1). If I can move that ""you"" rule next to the ""baba"" rule and an ""is"" rule to reinforce the ""baba is you"" rule, but that's already active.

Alternatively, create a new rule like ""you is win"", making the player (you) the win condition. To do that, need the ""win"" rule next to ""you"" and an ""is"" rule.

The ""you"" rule is at (1,-1), ""win"" at (8,5), ""is"" at (2,1) and (-1,-1). The closest ""is"" rule to ""you"" is at (-1,-1). So the path from ""you"" to ""is"" is possible if there's a path.

Assuming the player is at (0,0), ""you"" is at (1,-1), ""is"" at (-1,-1). So moving right to (1,-1), pick up ""you"", then move left to (-1,-1), place ""you"" next to ""is"" and ""win"" somehow. But ""win"" is far away.

This seems impossible. Maybe another approach: Since the player is Baba and ""Baba is you"", maybe the goal is to reach the door, and if the door is a win, then stepping on it wins. But how to make the door a win.

Alternatively, the door might already be a win if the rule ""door is win"" exists. Checking the active rules: No, the active rules are only ""baba is you"". The other rules like ""door"", ""win"" are objects on the map, not active rules. So the win condition is still the object at (8,5), which is unreachable.

This suggests that the solution requires manipulating the rules to make the door the win condition. To do that, the player needs to move the ""win"" rule next to the door and an ""is"" rule.

But given the layout, it's not feasible. Maybe there's a different way. Let's think about the ""rule `is`"" at (2,1). If I can move that ""is"" rule down to be near the door and the ""win"" rule.

Alternatively, use the ""rule `is`"" at (-1,-1). If I can move the ""win"" rule to be next to the door and that ""is"" rule.

But again, the ""win"" rule is too far.

Wait, maybe the key is involved. If the key is at (1,4), and there's a lock somewhere, but I don't see a lock. So probably not.

Another Idea: The ""rule `you`"" is at (1,-1). If I can move it to be next to the ""baba"" rule and an ""is"" rule, creating ""baba is you"" which is already the case. But maybe combining ""you"" with another rule to change the win condition.

Alternatively, create ""you is win"" by moving the ""win"" rule next to ""you"" and an ""is"" rule. But the ""win"" rule is too far.

Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, maybe the intended solution is to move the ""you"" rule down to combine with the ""baba"" and ""is"" rules, even though it seems redundant. So the action would be to move down to pick up the ""you"" rule, then move left to combine it.

But the previous attempts resulted in failures. Alternatively, the correct action is to move down to the ""you"" rule and grab it, then move left to place it near the ""baba"" and ""is"" rules.

So the steps would be:

1. Move down once to reach the ""you"" rule.
2. Move left to reach the ""baba"" rule and ""is"" rule.
3. Place the ""you"" rule next to them to create ""baba is you"" (already exists), but maybe it's needed to reinforce.

Alternatively, move the ""you"" rule to another location to create a new rule.

But based on the observation, the correct action might be to move down to get the ""you"" rule, then move left to combine it with the existing rules.

Given the previous failed attempts, perhaps the correct action now is to move down to the ""you"" rule's location.

Let's see. The active rule is ""baba is you"", which means I can move around as Baba. The goal is usually to reach the ""win"" object, which is likely the door or something similar. Looking at the objects on the map:

There's a door 1 step to the left. But doors are usually ""stop"" by default unless there's a rule saying otherwise. However, in the current active rules, I don't see a rule about the door being stop. Wait, but there's a rule `door 6 steps to the right and 1 step down`, but that's positioned on the map, not an active rule like ""door is stop"". So maybe the door is passable.

But to get to the door, there's a wall 3 steps to the right. So how do I get past the walls? The walls are there unless there's a rule that makes them movable. The current rules are just ""baba is you"". So the walls are solid stops. But maybe I can move text blocks to change the rules.

Looking at the objects, there are several ""rule `is`"" blocks scattered around. For example, at 7 steps right and 5 up, 2 right and 1 up, etc. If I can move the ""is"" block next to another text block, I can create a new rule. For example, if I can move the ""is"" near ""baba"", maybe I can make ""baba is win"" or something like that, changing the win condition to Baba himself.

Alternatively, maybe I can make Baba ""push"" by creating a rule like ""baba is push"", then move other objects. But first, I need to see where the ""is"" blocks are located and how to reach them.

The key is at 1 step right and 4 up. Maybe picking up the key opens a door, but there's a door 1 step left. Not sure if the key is necessary here. Let's focus on the rules.

The rule `is` at 2 steps right and 1 step up. If I can move that ""is"" block next to ""baba"" which is 2 steps left and 1 step down, then I can create a new rule. For instance, moving the ""is"" to be next to ""baba"" and ""win"", making ""baba is win"". That would make Baba the win condition, so touching him would win.

To do that, I need to move the ""is"" block. But the ""is"" blocks are movable unless they're part of an active rule. Since the active rules are ""baba is you"", the ""is"" blocks are just objects and can be moved. So my plan is to move the ""is"" block from 2 steps right and 1 step up to be next to ""baba"" at 2 steps left and 1 step down. Wait, no, the ""baba"" is at 2 step left and 1 step down, and the ""is"" is at 2 steps right and 1 step up. That's a bit far. Maybe there's a closer ""is"" block.

Looking again: there's a rule `is` at 7 steps right and 5 up (same as the ""win"" and ""is"" above). That's too far. Another `is` is at 2 steps right and 1 step up. The ""baba"" is at 2 steps left and 1 step down. So the distance between the ""is"" at 2R1U and ""baba"" at 2L1D is diagonal. Maybe moving down and right to get close.

Alternatively, the `is` at 1 step left and 1 step down. Wait, the rule `is` is at 1 step to the left and 1 step down. The ""baba"" is at 2 steps left and 1 step down. So if I can move the ""is"" at 1L1D next to ""baba"", then I can make ""baba is win"" by placing ""win"" nearby. But where is the ""win"" object? It's at 8 steps right and 5 up. That's far away.

Alternatively, maybe create a rule that makes the door a ""stop"" so I can push past it, but that might not help. Alternatively, make myself ""push"" so I can move walls. But to do that, I need to create ""baba is push"".

Another approach: the door is 1 step left. If I can move the door somewhere else, but doors are usually part of the level layout. Maybe not. Alternatively, change the door's property. If there's a rule `door is stop`, but I don't see that active. So maybe the door isn't stop. Let me check the active rules again. The active rules are only ""baba is you"". So the door is passable unless there's a ""stop"" rule affecting it. Since there's a `rule `stop` 1 step to the left and 3 step up`, but that's a separate object, not an active rule. So the door is probably passable.

But to get to the door at 1 step left, there's a wall 3 steps to the right. So how to get past the wall? Maybe by making the wall not a stop. For that, I need to break the ""wall is stop"" rule. Wait, but there's no active rule saying ""wall is stop"". The active rules are ""baba is you"". The other rules like ""rule `wall` 2 step to the left and 3 step up"" are just text blocks on the map, not active rules. So the walls are just regular walls unless there's a rule making them stop. Since there's no such active rule, the walls are passable? Wait, no. In Baba Is You, by default, certain objects like walls are stop. But if there's no rule defining them as stop, they aren't. So maybe the walls here are not stop. Wait, but looking at the initial problem description, it says ""remember that you can only move objects or text that are not defined as 'STOP' or similar immovable properties."" So if there's no active rule making walls stop, they are movable. But in the current observation, the active rules only have ""baba is you"". So walls are movable. Wait, but in the initial level, walls are usually stop. Maybe the level has a rule that makes walls stop. Let me check the objects again.

The objects include ""rule `wall` 2 step to the left and 3 step up"". But that's a text block on the map, not an active rule. Active rules are the ones formed by ""[Subject] IS [Property]"". The only active rule here is ""baba is you"". So walls are not stop unless there's an active rule. Therefore, the walls are passable. So maybe I can just walk through them.

But in the observation, the walls are listed as objects in specific positions. So to get to the door at 1 step left, I need to move left, but there's a wall 3 steps to the right. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the directions. The walls are positioned at various coordinates, but my position isn't specified. Wait, the problem says ""Objects on the map"" with their positions relative to me? Or relative to the starting point? The problem isn't entirely clear, but assuming that the player (Baba) is at a certain position, and the objects are located relative to that.

Assuming I need to get to the door at 1 step left, but there's a wall 3 steps to the right blocking the path. If the walls are passable, then I can just walk around them. But if they're stop, I can't. Since there's no active rule making walls stop, they should be passable. So maybe I can move left past the wall.

But looking at the objects, there's a door 1 step to the left, which is the likely win condition. So if I can move left, that would be the solution. But why previous actions failed? Maybe the assistant was trying to move left but there's an obstacle.

Wait, the user's previous actions were left, left, right, etc., but the system kept failing. Maybe the assistant needs to think differently.

Another angle: perhaps the key is needed to unlock the door. The key is at 1 step right and 4 up. If I can pick up the key, then use it on the door. But how does that work in Baba Is You? Usually, you need a ""key is push"" or something, but if the door is a ""lock"", then having the key might allow passage. But in the current setup, there's no rule about a lock. The door is just a door. So maybe picking up the key isn't necessary.

Alternatively, creating a rule like ""door is win"" so that touching the door makes me win. To do that, I need to move the ""is"" block next to ""door"" and ""win"". The ""win"" is at 8 steps right and 5 up, and the door is at 1 step left. That's a distance. Maybe moving the ""is"" block from 2 steps right and 1 step up to be next to the door and win. But that would require moving multiple steps.

Alternatively, create ""baba is win"" by moving the ""is"" next to ""baba"" and ""win"". The ""win"" is far away, but maybe there's a closer ""win"" rule. Wait, the active rules are ""baba is you"". The ""win"" object is at 8 steps right and 5 up as a separate object, not part of an active rule. So to make ""baba is win"", I need to create that rule by moving the ""is"" next to both ""baba"" and ""win"".

But ""baba"" is at 2 steps left and 1 step down, and ""win"" is at 8 steps right and 5 up. That's a long distance. Maybe there's a closer text block. The rule `win` is at 8 steps right and 5 up, same as the ""is"" there. So if I can move the ""is"" from 7 steps right and 5 up (which is the same position as ""win"" and another ""is"") to be next to ""baba"", that would work. But how to get there?

Alternatively, use the ""is"" at 2 steps right and 1 step up. If I can move that ""is"" block towards ""baba"" and ""win"". Let's think: moving the ""is"" block from 2R1U to, say, 1R1U, then to 0R1U (center?), then to 2L1D where ""baba"" is. But this requires multiple moves, and the assistant is supposed to choose one action per step.

Alternatively, focus on the ""is"" at 1 step left and 1 step down. That's near the ""baba"" at 2L1D. If I can move the ""is"" there next to ""baba"" and then add ""win"" to create ""baba is win"". But where is the ""win"" text block? It's at 8R5U. So unless I can bring the ""win"" block closer, this is difficult.

Perhaps the key is to realize that the current active rule is ""baba is you"", so you are Baba. The goal is usually to reach the win condition, which is likely the door. If the door is passable, then moving left towards it would work. But why previous actions failed? Maybe the assistant was trying to move left but there's a wall in the way. Wait, but earlier analysis suggests walls are passable if not ruled as stop. So maybe the assistant needs to move left past the walls.

But according to the observations, after several left moves, the position of the player might have changed, and now the door is accessible. Let's check the latest observation:

The door is 1 step to the left. If I'm currently not at that position, moving left would reach it. But the assistant's previous actions were left, left, right, etc., possibly moving away. So perhaps the correct action now is to move left to reach the door.

Alternatively, check if there's a rule that makes the door a stop. But there's no active rule for that. So the door should be passable. Therefore, the solution is to move left towards the door.

59,down,"<reasoning>
Let's see. The current active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I can move and manipulate text blocks. The goal is usually to reach a ""win"" object, but I need to check the current state.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a door located at 1 step to the left. The win rule is way to the right at 9 steps right and 5 up. The key is at 2 steps right and 4 up, but I'm not sure if I need it yet. There are several ""is"" text blocks that might be useful for creating new rules.

The ""you"" rule is at 1 step to the right and 1 step down. If I can combine ""baba"" with ""you,"" maybe I can become the you, allowing me to move through stop objects. But right now, I'm just Baba, which can move but might be blocked by walls or stop rules.

The walls are all aligned to the right, creating a barrier. The ""stop"" rule is at 4 step up, so moving into that direction might be blocked. The door is to the left, but I need to check if it's a win condition. The active rules still say ""win"" is at 9 steps right, so the door might not be the win unless I change the rule.

The plan: Maybe move towards the ""is"" blocks to create a new rule. For example, if I take the ""is"" at 3 steps right and 1 step up and combine it with ""baba"" to make ""baba is win,"" then I could turn myself into the win object. But I need to be able to move the text blocks.

Wait, but the ""stop"" rule is at 4 step up. If I move upwards, I might hit a stop wall. Alternatively, moving left towards the ""you"" rule. If I can make ""baba is you,"" but that's already the case. Maybe change ""you"" to something else.

Looking at the rule at 1 step down: ""rule `is` 1 step down"" and ""rule `you` 1 step to the right and 1 step down."" If I can move the ""you"" block and combine it with another property, like ""win,"" then maybe ""baba is win."" Let me check the positions.

The ""you"" block is at 1 step right and 1 step down. There's also a ""key"" at 8 steps right and 1 step up, but that's probably not immediately useful. The ""is"" block at 3 steps right and 1 step up could be moved. If I move that ""is"" block next to the ""you"" block, then create ""you is win,"" but I need to make sure that's allowed.

Alternatively, maybe move the ""baba"" rule (which is at 1 step left and 1 step down) to combine with ""is"" and ""win."" For example, moving ""baba"" next to ""is"" and ""win"" to form ""baba is win."" That would make me the win object, allowing me to touch the door or the win block.

But how to move these blocks? I need to check if they are movable. The rules say that objects defined as ""stop"" or similar can't be moved. The current active rule is only ""baba is you,"" so most objects should be movable unless they're part of a stop rule. The ""stop"" is at 4 step up, so not immediately in the way.

So the steps could be:

1. Move left to reach the ""baba"" rule at 1 step left and 1 step down.
2. Then move the ""baba"" block to a position where I can combine it with ""is"" and ""win.""
3. Once ""baba is win"" is created, touching the win block (at 9 steps right) would win the level.

But navigating through the walls might be tricky. The walls are all aligned to the right, so moving right is blocked except at certain points. Maybe moving left towards the ""baba"" rule and then down to the ""is"" and ""you"" rules.

Alternatively, move the ""is"" block from 3 steps right and 1 step up to be next to ""baba"" and ""win"" to form the new rule. Let's see the positions:

- ""baba"" rule is at 1 step left and 1 step down.
- ""is"" block at 3 steps right and 1 step up.
- ""win"" rule is at 9 steps right and 5 step up.

This might be a bit too far. Maybe focus on the lower part first. The ""you"" rule is nearby. If I can make ""baba is win"" by moving the ""is"" block between ""baba"" and ""win,"" that would be ideal. But the distance is significant. Perhaps moving step by step.

Another approach: Use the key if needed, but I don't see a lock yet. The door is at 1 step left, but it's unclear if it's openable with a key. The key is at 2 steps right and 4 step up, which is blocked by walls. Maybe I need to move the walls by changing their rules.

Wait, the ""wall"" rule is at 1 step left and 4 step up. If I can change that to something else, like ""wall is push"" or remove it, that might clear a path. But to do that, I need to move the ""wall"" rule text block.

So, possible actions:

- Move left towards the ""baba"" rule to position myself better.
- Move down towards the ""is"" block at 3 steps right and 1 step up.
- Combine ""baba,"" ""is,"" and ""win"" to create the new rule.

But how to physically move the blocks? Each action is a single step in a direction. Maybe I need to get close to the ""is"" block and then move it by stepping next to it and then moving in the direction I want to push it. However, in Baba Is You, you can push text blocks by moving into them from the side.

Given that, perhaps the best immediate action is to move left to get closer to the ""baba"" rule and the ""is"" blocks below. Let's check the current position. The assistant's previous actions were moving left, right, down, etc., but the exact position of the agent isn't specified in the observations. However, the objects are positioned relative to the agent. For example, ""wall 3 steps to the right"" means the wall is three steps to the right of the agent.

Assuming the agent is somewhere in the center, perhaps moving left towards the ""baba"" rule at 1 step left and 1 step down. Alternatively, moving down to reach the ""is"" block at 3 steps right and 1 step up (but that's up, not down).

Wait, the ""is"" block is at 3 steps right and 1 step up. So if the agent is looking up, that block is above and to the right. To reach it, the agent might need to move up and right, but there are walls blocking the path.

The walls are at 3 steps right and various ups. So moving right would hit a wall unless there's a gap. The key is at 2 steps right and 4 step up, which is behind a wall at 3 steps right and 4 step up. So maybe the path is blocked.

Alternative plan: Use the existing ""is"" blocks to create a rule that allows moving through walls. For example, ""wall is push"" or ""stop is nothing."" But that requires manipulating the rules.

Alternatively, since the agent is Baba and ""baba is you,"" the agent can move freely (except stopped by stop objects). The main obstacle is the walls. But if the agent can create a rule like ""wall is not stop,"" then they can pass through walls.

To do that, the agent needs to move the ""wall"" rule text block and the ""stop"" rule text block and rearrange them. For example, move ""wall"" next to ""is"" and ""not stop,"" but I don't have a ""not"" block here.

Alternatively, create ""wall is you,"" but that might not help. Hmm.

Another angle: The door is at 1 step left. If the door is a win condition, then touching it would win. But the active rules say ""win"" is at 9 steps right. Unless the door's rule has been changed. Check if there's a ""door is win"" rule. Looking at the objects, there's a ""rule `door` 6 steps to the right and 2 steps down,"" but that doesn't make door win unless combined with another rule.

Alternatively, if I can make ""door is win"" by moving the ""win"" rule next to ""door,"" then touching the door would be winning. The ""win"" rule is at 9 steps right and 5 step up, which is far away. The door is at 1 step left, so maybe not reachable in time.

Back to manipulating rules. The key is at 2 steps right and 4 step up. Maybe I need to get the key first, but it's behind a wall. To move the wall, I need to change its rule. The ""wall"" rule is at 2 step left and 4 step up. If I can move that ""wall"" rule text block, perhaps to delete it or change its property.

For example, move the ""wall"" rule to say ""wall is push,"" but I need an ""is"" block nearby. The ""is"" block is at 7 steps right and 5 step up (rule `is` 7 steps right and 5 step up). That's far.

Alternatively, use the ""is"" block at 3 steps right and 1 step up. If I can move that ""is"" block next to the ""wall"" rule at 2 step left and 4 step up, then create a new rule like ""wall is push."" But the positions are too far apart.

This is getting complicated. Maybe the immediate action is to move towards the ""is"" block at 3 steps right and 1 step up to use it for creating a new rule. To get there, the agent needs to move right and down, but there's a wall at 3 steps right and 4 step up, blocking the path up. So moving down might be better.

Wait, the agent's current position isn't specified, but the objects are relative. Let's assume the agent is somewhere in the lower part, given that the door is at 1 step left and the ""you"" rule is at 1 step right and 1 step down.

If the agent moves left towards the door, but the door is a potential win if its rule is changed. Alternatively, move to the ""baba"" rule at 2 step left and 2 steps down to combine it with ""is"" and ""win.""

But time is limited. The best action might be to move towards the ""is"" block at 3 steps right and 1 step up to create a new rule. So, the action would be to move right or down.

Looking at the last observation, the agent previously moved down and left, leading to the current state where the ""baba"" rule is at 1 step left and 1 step down. Maybe moving left again to get closer to that ""baba"" rule, then moving down to reach the ""is"" block.

Alternatively, move down once to get to the 1 step down level where ""is"" and ""you"" rules are present. Then, move left to reach the ""baba"" rule.

So, the chosen action is down, then left, but since only one action is allowed, I'll pick down first.

Let me try to figure out what to do here. The current active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means that whatever Baba can do, I can do too. My goal is usually to reach a ""win"" object, but I need to check if there are any other rules that might have changed that.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a ""door"" object somewhere. Usually, doors are something you need to interact with to win, but right now the active rule is still ""baba is you,"" so maybe I can push or move the door? Wait, but there's also a ""key"" mentioned. Do I need to get the key first? Let me check the objects again.

There's a key located at 2 steps to the right and 4 steps up. The walls are blocking some paths, but since ""baba is you,"" I shouldn't be stopped by walls unless they have a ""stop"" property. Looking at the rules, there's a ""rule stop"" at 4 steps up. That might mean that the walls above are stoppers, so I can't pass through them. 

The key is up there at 2 right, 4 up. To get there, I need to move up from my current position. But how do I move? The previous actions were left, right, down, etc. Wait, in the latest observation, after moving down, where am I now? The problem is that the observations keep changing as I move, but the user hasn't specified my current position. Hmm, this might be tricky. 

Alternatively, maybe I should look for text blocks that I can move to change the rules. For example, if there's an ""is"" rule nearby, I can move it to create a new rule. Like, if I can move ""is"" next to ""baba"" and ""win,"" then I could make ""baba is win,"" which would let me win by touching Baba. 

Looking at the objects, there's a ""rule `is`"" at 8 steps to the right and 5 steps up. If I can get to that ""is"" rule and move it next to ""baba"" and ""win,"" that might work. But how do I move the ""is"" rule? Since ""baba is you,"" I can move objects that aren't stopped. The ""is"" rule isn't marked as stop, so I should be able to move it. 

So the plan could be: move towards the ""is"" rule at 8 right, 5 up, then reposition it so that ""baba is win"" becomes active. That way, touching Baba (which is me) would make me the win object. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a door that I can push. If the door is a ""stop"" object, I can't push it, but if I change the rule to make ""door"" something I can move, that might help. For example, if I make ""door is push,"" then I could move it out of the way. 

But right now, the active rules are still ""baba is you,"" and the other rules are about walls and stop. The key is up there, but I need to see if getting the key unlocks something. However, without knowing the level layout fully, it's hard to say. 

Another angle: maybe the ""win"" object is at 9 steps right and 5 up, but there's a wall blocking the path. If I can remove the wall's ""stop"" property or redefine it, I could move through. 

Wait, there's a ""rule wall"" at 1 step left and 4 step up. If I can move that ""wall"" rule away or change it, maybe the wall becomes passable. 

But I think the most straightforward solution is to create a new rule that makes Baba the win. So, find the ""is"" rule and place it next to ""baba"" and ""win."" 

To do that, I need to move the ""is"" block from 8 right,5 up to somewhere between ""baba"" and ""win."" Looking at the current positions, ""baba"" is at 1 step left and 1 step down, and ""win"" is at 9 right,5 up. There's a ""rule `is`"" at 8 right,5 up. If I can move that ""is"" down to be near ""baba"" and ""win,"" maybe repositioning it to create ""baba is win."" 

But how to move the ""is"" rule? Since I'm Baba and ""you,"" I can move objects that aren't stop. The ""is"" rule isn't stop, so I can pick it up and move it. 

So the steps would be: move down to reach the ""is"" rule, then move it left or right to connect with ""baba"" and ""win."" 

In the latest observation, after moving down, I'm probably near the ""baba"" rule at 1 step left and 1 step down. Maybe I should move left to get to that ""baba"" rule, then move the ""is"" next to it. 

Alternatively, if I can get to the ""win"" rule at 9 right,5 up, but that's blocked by walls. 

Alternatively, maybe the door at 1 step left is the win condition, but I need to open it. If I can make the door a pushable object, then pushing it might open it. 

But I'm not sure. Let me think again. The key is at 2 right,4 up. If I go get the key, maybe that unlocks the door. But without knowing the level's mechanics, it's hard to say. 

Alternatively, since ""baba is you,"" maybe I can just walk into the door if it's considered a win. But according to the active rules, the win is still at 9 right,5 up. 

Wait, in the current observation, the active rules are still ""baba is you,"" so the win condition is wherever the ""win"" rule points. The ""win"" rule is at 9 right,5 up, but there's a wall there. Unless the wall is no longer a stop. 

Alternatively, maybe I need to redefine the win condition. If I can move the ""win"" rule to be near the door, then touching the door would make me win. 

But this requires manipulating the text blocks. 

Given the previous failed attempts, maybe the correct action is to move towards the ""is"" rule to rearrange the rules. So, from the current position, where is the ""is"" rule located? In the last observation, it's at 8 steps to the right and 5 steps up. So if I'm currently at a position that's 4 steps to the right and 5 steps up (from the previous observation), moving left would get me closer. Wait, but in the latest observation, the user hasn't specified my position, only the objects. This is confusing. 

Perhaps I need to assume that I'm in a position where I can move towards the ""is"" rule. Given that the ""is"" rule is at 8 right,5 up, and the ""win"" is at 9 right,5 up, maybe moving right towards the ""win"" and ""is"" would help. 

Alternatively, since the ""baba"" rule is at 1 step left and 1 step down, maybe moving left to get to that ""baba"" rule and then move the ""is"" next to it. 

But without knowing my exact position, it's challenging. The previous actions were left, right, down, but they kept failing. Maybe the correct action now is to move down towards the ""baba"" rule at 1 left,1 down, which is probably below my current position. 

In the last observation, after moving down, the door is at 1 step left. So maybe moving left towards the door, but there's a wall at 4 steps right. 

Alternatively, focusing on the text blocks. The key is at 2 right,4 up. If I can get the key, maybe that opens the door. So moving up to reach the key. 

But the key is behind a wall? The walls are at 3 steps right and 4 step up, so maybe I need to move that wall's rule. There's a ""rule wall"" at 1 left and 4 up. If I can move that ""wall"" rule away, the path to the key might be clear. 

So the steps could be: move to the ""wall"" rule at 1 left,4 up, move it somewhere else, then go get the key. 

But this is getting complicated. Maybe the simplest solution is to create ""baba is win"" by moving the ""is"" rule next to them. 

To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule from 8 right,5 up to between ""baba"" (1 left,1 down) and ""win"" (9 right,5 up). That might require moving the ""is"" rule left or right. 

If I'm currently near the ""baba"" rule, moving right towards the ""is"" rule. Alternatively, if the ""is"" is above, moving up. 

But given the previous actions and failed attempts, perhaps the correct action now is to move left towards the ""baba"" rule, then move the ""is"" rule next to it. 

Alternatively, since the latest observation shows the door at 1 step left and the ""you"" rule at 1 step right and 1 step down, maybe interacting with the door by moving into it once the rule allows. 

But without changing the rules, I can't do much. 

So, putting it all together, the best action is to move towards the ""is"" rule to rearrange the rules. Since the ""is"" is at 8 right,5 up, and assuming I'm positioned somewhere lower, moving right and up. But the exact direction depends on my current position, which isn't specified. 

Given the uncertainty, the safest action might be to move down towards the ""baba"" rule to get closer to the text blocks needed to create the new rule. 

Alternatively, if I can push the ""is"" rule left or right, that would help. For example, moving the ""is"" rule from 8 right,5 up to 7 right,5 up, then placing it between ""baba"" and ""win."" 

But how to do that? Since I'm Baba, I can move the ""is"" rule. So the action would be to move right towards the ""is"" rule, then left or right to reposition it. 

In the last observation, after moving down, the ""is"" rule is still at 8 right,5 up. So maybe moving right twice to reach it, then moving left to place it next to ""baba."" 

But the problem is that the user hasn't provided my current position, making it hard to determine direction. 

Alternatively, the best action now is to move left towards the ""baba"" rule at 1 step left and 1 step down. So the action would be ""left.""

Let's try to figure out the best move here. The active rule is still ""baba is you"", so I am Baba. The goal is usually to reach the ""win"" object, which is probably the door or something similar. Looking at the current observation, the ""win"" rule is at 10 steps right and 5 up, but that's blocked by walls. There's a door at 1 step to the right, but it's a ""door"" which might be a win condition if I can change it. Also, there's a key at 3 steps right and 4 up. Maybe I need to get the key first?

Looking at the objects, the ""you"" rule is at 2 steps right and 1 step down. Since I'm Baba and ""baba is you"", that means I can move freely unless there's a ""stop"" or ""wall"". The walls are all aligned to the right, so maybe moving left could help. But the latest observation shows the door is at 1 step to the right, which is adjacent. However, there's a ""stop"" rule at 4 step up, but I'm not sure where that is exactly.

Wait, the ""door"" rule is at 8 steps right and 1 step down. Maybe that's the actual win condition. But how to reach it? If I can push the door or change its property. Since I'm ""you"", maybe I can move into it. But the door is on the right side, and the walls are blocking the path. Let me check the movement options.

The current position of Baba is at ""rule `baba` 1 step down"", so I'm one step below the starting point. The ""you"" rule is at 2 steps right and 1 step down, so that's nearby. To move towards the door, which is at 8 steps right and 1 step down, I need to go right multiple times. But the path is blocked by walls at 5 steps right. Maybe I can find a way around by moving up or down.

Looking at the map, there's a ""stop"" rule at 4 step up. If I can move up past the walls, maybe I can get to the key. The key is at 3 steps right and 4 step up. If I go up from my current position (1 step down), moving up once gets me to the level where the ""stop"" is. But can I pass through the stop? Since I'm Baba and ""you"", maybe stops don't affect me unless the rule says otherwise. Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at 4 step up, but I'm not sure if that's a wall or an actual stop. The walls are separate.

Alternatively, maybe I should pick up the key first. The key is at 3 right, 4 up. From my current position (1 down), moving up 4 steps would get me there, but there are walls at 5 steps right, so maybe I need to move left or right first. Wait, my current position is 1 step down, so moving up once would be level with the ""stop"" rule. Let me see the path.

If I move up from 1 step down to 4 step up, passing through the walls at 5 steps right. But those walls are at 5 right and 4 up, which is the same level as the key. Hmm, maybe I can move left or right to avoid the walls. Wait, the key is at 3 steps right and 4 up. So if I move right from my current position (1 down) to 3 right, 4 up, but there's a wall at 5 right. So maybe I need to go around. Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe the solution is to reach the door by changing the ""win"" rule. The ""win"" is at 10 right and 5 up, but it's blocked. If I can move the ""win"" text block to be next to Baba, then touching it would make me win. But how to move the text blocks? I need to be able to move them, which requires that they are not stopped. The ""is"" rules are movable unless they're part of a ""stop"" or similar rule.

Looking at the objects, there's a ""rule `is`"" at 9 steps right and 5 up (same as ""win""). If I can move that ""is"" rule next to the ""win"" to make ""baba is win"", then touching the win object would make me win. But how to get there? The path is blocked by walls. Maybe I need to use the key to unlock something, but there's no lock mentioned.

Alternatively, since I'm Baba and ""you"", maybe I can push the door. The door is a ""door"" object, and if I can make it a ""win"" by rearranging the rules. For example, if I move the ""win"" rule to be under the door, making ""door is win"". But the ""win"" rule is currently at 10 right, 5 up. To move it, I need to be next to it and move left or right. But the path is blocked by walls at 5 steps right. Unless there's a way to go around by moving up or down.

Another angle: the ""baba is you"" rule is active, so I can move anywhere unless there's a ""stop"" or ""wall"". The walls are all to the right, so maybe moving left towards the door is possible. The door is at 1 step right, which is adjacent to my current position (1 step down). Wait, if I'm at 1 step down, and the door is at 1 step right, then moving right would take me to the door. But is there a wall in between? Let me check the objects again.

Looking at the objects: door is at 1 step to the right. Are there any walls between me and the door? My current position is rule `baba` 1 step down. The door is 1 step to the right from there. So moving right once would put me next to the door. But is there a wall blocking that path? The walls are at 5 steps right and various positions up. So in the same horizontal line (1 step down), the door is at 1 right, and there's no wall mentioned there. So maybe I can simply move right to reach the door.

But why didn't the previous actions work? The user tried moving left multiple times, but maybe that's not the right path. Alternatively, maybe the door is a ""stop"" or requires a key. Wait, the door's rule is at 8 steps right and 1 step down. The door itself is at 1 step right. The ""rule `door`"" is separate. So touching the door object might not be enough unless the rule says ""door is win"".

Currently, the active rules are only ""baba is you"". The ""win"" is a rule at 10 right, 5 up. So unless I change the rules to make ""door is win"", touching the door won't work. Therefore, the correct approach is to manipulate the rules. To do that, I need to move the ""win"" rule to be under the door object, or change the door's property.

To move the ""win"" rule, I need to be adjacent to it and move left or right. The ""win"" rule is at 10 right, 5 up. My current position is 1 step down, which is lower. To reach the ""win"" rule, I need to move up 4 steps and right 9 steps, but there are walls blocking the path at 5 right. So that's not feasible.

Alternative idea: use the ""is"" rule to create a new rule. For example, if I can move the ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" to make ""baba is win"". But the ""is"" rules are scattered. There's an ""is"" at 9 right, 5 up (next to ""win""), and another at 4 right, 1 up, etc. If I can move the ""is"" at 9 right, 5 up down to be next to ""baba"", then I can make ""baba is win"".

But how to move that ""is"" rule? I need to be adjacent to it and move it. The ""is"" is at 9 right, 5 up. My current position is 1 step down. To get to that ""is"", I need to move up 4 steps and right 8 steps, but again, walls are at 5 right. So blocked.

Another approach: look for the ""you"" rule. Since I'm Baba and ""you"", maybe I can push objects. The door is a ""door"" object. If I can make ""door is you"" or ""door is win"", then touching it would work. To do that, I need to move the relevant ""is"" rule next to the door.

The ""is"" rule at 1 step right and 1 step down is near the door. If I can move that ""is"" to be under the door, making ""door is [something]"". For example, if I move the ""is"" to be next to the door, then I can attach a property like ""win"" to it.

So the steps would be: move to the ""is"" rule at 1 right, 1 down, then move it to be adjacent to the door (which is at 1 right). But wait, the ""is"" is already at 1 right and 1 down, same horizontal level as the door (which is at 1 step right). So if I move the ""is"" down to be under the door, then I can make ""door is win"".

But how to move the ""is"" rule? I need to be adjacent to it and move it. The ""is"" is at 1 right, 1 down. My current position is 1 step down, but where exactly? The ""baba"" rule is at 1 step down, but the exact coordinates might be different. Assuming I'm next to the ""is"" rule, I can move it.

Alternatively, move to the ""is"" rule and then push it towards the door. Since I'm ""you"", I can push objects that are not ""stop"". The ""is"" rule is movable unless it's part of a ""stop"" rule. The ""stop"" rule is at 4 step up, which is separate.

So possible actions: move right to get to the ""is"" rule at 1 right, 1 down, then move it down to be under the door. Once that's done, the rule would be ""door is win"", and touching the door would make me win.

Alternatively, if I can move the ""win"" rule to be next to the door. The ""win"" rule is at 10 right, 5 up. That's far away, but maybe there's another way.

Another possibility: since I'm Baba and ""you"", I can move into the door if the rule allows. But currently, the door's rule is just ""door"", so unless it's defined as ""win"", touching it doesn't do anything. So I need to change its rule.

So the best course of action is to move the ""is"" rule next to the door to make it ""door is win"". To do that, I need to navigate to the ""is"" rule at 1 right, 1 down, then move it down or up to be adjacent to the door.

But how to get there? From my current position (rule `baba` 1 step down), which is likely at coordinates (x, y) where y is 1 down. The ""is"" rule is at 1 right, 1 down, so if I'm already next to it, I can move it. If not, I need to move right or down.

Assuming I'm at the same position as the ""baba"" rule, which is 1 step down. The ""is"" rule is at 1 right, 1 down. So if I move right once, I'm next to the ""is"" rule. Then, I can move the ""is"" down to be under the door, which is at 1 right. So moving the ""is"" down once would place it at 1 right, 2 down, adjacent to the door at 1 right, 1 down. Then the rule becomes ""door is win"", and touching the door would make me win.

So the steps would be:

1. Move right to reach the ""is"" rule.
2. Move the ""is"" rule down to be next to the door.
3. Now, ""door is win"" is active, so touching the door wins.

Therefore, the action should be to move right to get to the ""is"" rule, then push it down. But since each action is a single step, the first action is to move right.

Let's see. I need to figure out the next move in this Baba Is You level. The active rule is still ""baba is you,"" which means I can move around and possibly manipulate other text blocks.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a door at 1 step to the left. I remember that normally a door is a win condition if you can push it or move into it. But right now, the rule for win is still pointing to the win block up higher, so the door isn't the win condition. 

There's a key at 2 steps to the right and 4 steps up. Maybe I need to get that key to unlock something, but the door isn't locked yet. Wait, let's check the other rules. There's a ""stop"" rule at 4 steps up, which might be a wall or another object that can't be moved. 

Looking down, there's a rule ""baba is you"" at 1 step to the left and 1 step down. Also, there's an ""is"" rule and ""you"" rule nearby. Maybe if I can move those text blocks, I can change the rules. For example, if I can make ""baba is win,"" then touching the door would make me win. Or maybe ""door is you,"" so I can push the door. 

But right now, the key is at 2 steps right and 4 up. To get there, I might have to move up, but there are walls blocking the path. The walls are at 4 steps right and various up positions. Wait, the key is at 2 steps right and 4 up, which is to the left of the walls. Maybe I can move left from my current position to reach the key. However, the ""stop"" rule is at 4 steps up, which might be a wall I can't move through. 

Alternatively, since I'm Baba and can move text blocks, maybe I can pick up the ""is"" rule that's at 3 steps right and 1 step up. If I can move that ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" or ""door,"" I could create a new rule. For example, moving ""is"" to make ""baba is win"" or ""door is you."" 

Looking at the current position of the ""is"" block, it's at 3 steps right and 1 step up. If I move right from my current position (which I assume is at 4 steps right and 5 up, based on the previous observations), but wait, in the latest observation, the active rules and objects show that the player is at the position of ""baba"" which is 1 step to the left and 1 step down. So maybe my current position is at 1 step right and 1 step down relative to the starting point. 

Wait, the objects list has ""rule `baba` 1 step to the left and 1 step down"". So the player (Baba) is located at 1 step left and 1 step down from wherever the reference point is. The other objects are positioned relative to that. 

So to move towards the ""is"" block at 3 steps right and 1 step up from the baba's position, I would need to go right twice and up once. But first, check if there are any stop rules blocking the path. The ""stop"" rule is at 4 step up, which is above the key area. So moving up from baba's position (1 left, 1 down) might not hit a stop immediately. 

Alternatively, the door is at 1 step to the left. If I can make myself a door by changing the rules, then touching the door would make me win. To do that, I might need to move the ""you"" rule to baba. The ""you"" rule is at 1 step right and 1 step down. So if I can move that ""you"" rule next to ""baba,"" then ""baba is you"" would still be active, but maybe combining with another rule. Wait, the existing rule is ""baba is you,"" so if I move the ""you"" block to align with ""door,"" that might not help. 

Another approach: The ""win"" rule is at 9 steps right and 5 up. That's far up and to the right. Maybe I need to get there, but there are walls blocking the path. The ""is"" rules are scattered, but maybe I can create a new rule like ""door is win"" so that pushing the door would make it a win. To do that, I need to move the ""is"" block next to ""door"" and ""win"". The ""door"" rule is at 7 steps right and 1 step down. The ""win"" rule is at 9 right and 5 up. That's a bit too far. 

Wait, maybe I can focus on the ""you"" rule. If I can make ""baba is you"" and also ""door is you,"" then maybe I can push the door. But the existing ""you"" is at 1 step right and 1 step down. If I move that ""you"" to the door's position, then ""door is you"" would make me able to push the door. But how to move the ""you"" rule? I need to be adjacent to it and not blocked by a stop. The ""stop"" rule is at 4 step up, which might not be in the way. 

Looking at the current position of the ""you"" rule: 1 step right and 1 step down from Baba's position. So if I move right once, I can reach the ""you"" rule. Then pick it up and move it to the door's location. But the door is at 1 step to the left from the starting point, which might be 1 step left from Baba's current position (1 left, 1 down). Wait, the door's position is 1 step to the left, which relative to Baba's position (1 left, 1 down) would be 0 left, 1 down. So the door is directly to the left of Baba. 

So if I move left from my current position (which is 1 left, 1 down), I would reach the door. But the door's rule is ""door is door"" unless changed. But the active rule is still ""baba is you,"" so touching the door wouldn't win unless I change the win condition. 

Alternatively, if I can move the ""you"" rule to the door, making ""door is you,"" then I could push the door, and since ""baba is you,"" moving into the door (which is you) would make me win. But how to do that? 

Current plan: Move to the ""you"" rule at 1 step right and 1 step down, pick it up, and move it to the door's location (1 step left). But first, check if there are any stops. The path to the ""you"" rule is right, which is clear. Then moving left to the door. The door is a stop unless the rule says otherwise. Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at 4 step up, so not in the way. 

So the steps would be: move right to get to the ""you"" rule, then move left to the door, placing the ""you"" there. Then the rule becomes ""door is you,"" and since I'm you, pushing the door would make me win. 

But how to execute this? The current action needed is the next move. So from Baba's position (1 left, 1 down), moving right once would get to the ""you"" rule. Then maybe move left to the door. But in the next move, the assistant has to choose one action: up, down, left, right, or idle. 

Alternatively, maybe the immediate action is to move right to reach the ""you"" rule. Let's check the observation again. The ""you"" rule is at 1 step right and 1 step down from Baba's position. Wait, the observation says: ""rule `you` 1 step to the right and 2 steps to the right and 2 steps down?"" No, looking back: ""rule `you` 2 steps to the right and 2 steps down"" — no, in the latest observation, it's ""rule `you` 1 step to the right and 1 step down"". 

So Baba is at 1 left, 1 down. The ""you"" rule is 1 right and 1 down from Baba. So moving right once would place me next to the ""you"" rule. Then, I can pick it up and move it. But in the game, you have to move adjacent to the text block to pick it up, then move it in the desired direction. 

So the first action should be to move right to get next to the ""you"" rule. Then, perhaps move down to pick it up, but no, movement is only up, down, left, right. Once adjacent, you can push the text block in a direction, which counts as a move. 

So the sequence would be: move right to reach the ""you"" rule, then move down (direction to push it), but I need to confirm the game mechanics. In Baba Is You, to move a text block, you have to be adjacent to it and then move in the direction you want to push it. So if I'm to the left of the ""you"" rule, I can move right to be on top of it, then move in any direction to push it. 

Wait, in the current position, Baba is at 1 left and 1 down. The ""you"" rule is 1 right and 1 down. So Baba is to the left of the ""you"" rule. To pick it up, move right once to be adjacent, then choose a direction to push it. For example, move right again to push it further right, or down to push it down. 

But the goal is to get the ""you"" rule to the door, which is 1 step left from Baba's original position (assuming the door is at 1 step left from where Baba started). Wait, the door's position is ""1 step to the left"", which relative to Baba's current position (1 left, 1 down) would be 0 left, 1 down. So the door is directly to the left of Baba. 

So after picking up the ""you"" rule, moving left would push it towards the door. So the plan is: move right to reach ""you"", then move left to push it to the door's location. 

But in one action, the assistant can only choose one direction. So the first action is to move right to get next to the ""you"" rule. The next action would be to move left to push it. But since the user is asking for the next action based on the current observation, the current position is such that the ""you"" rule is 1 step right and 1 step down from Baba. So to get to it, Baba needs to move right once. 

Therefore, the chosen action should be ""right"" to reach the ""you"" rule.

Let's try to figure out what to do here. The game is Baba Is You, right? So the goal is usually to reach the WIN object, which in this case might be the door or something else. Let me check the active rules.

Currently, the only active rule is ""baba is you"". That means I can move Baba around, but I have to see what other objects are there. Looking at the objects on the map, there's a door to the left, some walls, and a key. Also, there are several rule blocks like ""is"", ""wall"", ""stop"", ""key"", and ""door"". 

The key is at 1 step to the right and 4 steps up. Maybe I need to get the key to unlock the door? But the door is at 1 step to the left. However, I'm not sure where exactly Baba is located here. The observation lists the objects but doesn't explicitly say where Baba is. Wait, there's a rule ""rule `baba` 2 step to the left and 1 step down"". So Baba is at 2 steps left and 1 step down from the player's current position? Or is that the position of the ""baba"" text block? Hmm, this might be a bit confusing.

The active rule is ""baba is you"", so whatever I move, as long as it's Baba, I can control it. The goal is probably to reach the ""win"" condition. The ""win"" rule is at 8 steps to the right and 5 steps up. That's pretty far. But there are walls blocking the path. Also, there's a door at 1 step to the left. Maybe the door is the actual win condition, but it's a ""door"" which might be stoppable unless we change the rules.

Looking at the other rules, there's ""rule `door` 8 steps to the right and 2 steps down"". So if I can change the ""door"" rule, maybe I can make it something else. For example, if I make ""door is you"", then stepping on the door would make me the win condition. Or maybe ""door is win"", so the door itself becomes the win target.

But to do that, I need to move the ""is"" text block. The ""is"" blocks are at various positions. For instance, there's an ""is"" at 7 steps right and 5 steps up, which is part of the ""baba is you"" rule. If I can move that ""is"" to connect ""door"" with ""you"" or ""win"", that could change the game.

However, the problem is that some objects are marked as ""stop"", meaning I can't move them. The ""stop"" rule is at 1 step left and 4 steps up. So I need to find a way to move the ""is"" blocks without stepping on ""stop"" or walls. Let's see the positions again.

The ""is"" blocks are at:
- 9 steps right and 4 step up (part of ""win is ..."")
- 4 steps right (part of ""wall is ..."")
- 2 steps right and 1 step up (part of another rule)
- 1 step down (part of ""you is ..."")

Baba is at 2 steps left and 1 step down. So from Baba's position, to reach the ""is"" block at 1 step down, I need to move down. But is there a wall blocking the way? Let's check the walls. There's a wall at 5 steps right in several positions, but maybe the path down from Baba is clear.

If I move down from Baba's position, I can get to the ""is"" block at 1 step down. Then, maybe I can rearrange the ""baba is you"" rule by moving the ""is"" to connect ""you"" with something else. Wait, the existing rule is ""baba is you"", so if I can make ""you is win"", then stepping on ""win"" would make me the win condition.

To do that, I need to take the ""you"" text block and the ""is"" text block and place them next to ""win"". But first, I need to move the ""is"" block that's currently at 1 step down. Let me see where that ""is"" is. It's part of the ""you is ..."" rule. If I can move that ""is"" to after ""win"", then it becomes ""win is you"", making the player win when they touch the win object.

So the steps would be:
1. Move down from Baba's current position to reach the ""is"" block at 1 step down.
2. Pick up the ""is"" block (since it's not a stop object) and move it to be next to ""win"".
3. Then, the rule would be ""win is you"", so touching the win object (which is at 8 steps right and 5 steps up) would make me win.

But how to do this movement? Let's check the surrounding objects. When moving down from Baba's position (2 steps left and 1 step down), there's a wall at 3 steps to the right and 1 step down. Wait, no, the walls are at 5 steps right in various positions. Maybe the path down is clear. Let me check the objects again.

The objects listed include ""wall 3 steps to the right and 3 step up"", ""wall 5 steps to the right and 3 step up"", etc. But the immediate position below Baba (2 steps left, 1 step down) might be clear. There's a ""rule `door` 6 steps to the right and 1 step down"", but that's far to the right. So probably, moving down is possible.

So, the plan is to move down to get to the ""is"" block, then move it to the ""win"" rule. But how to reposition the ""win"" rule's ""is"" block? The ""win"" rule is at 8 steps right and 5 steps up with an ""is"" at 9 steps right and 5 steps up. If I can swap the ""is"" blocks between ""baba"" and ""win"", that could work.

Alternatively, take the ""is"" from the ""you"" rule (at 1 step down) and place it next to ""win"". So first, move down to the ""is"" block. Then, move right to reach the ""win"" and ""is"" positions. But there are walls at 5 steps right, so maybe need to go around.

This is getting a bit complex. Let's think step by step.

Current position of Baba: rule `baba` is at 2 step to the left and 1 step down. So if I'm controlling Baba, my current position is 2 steps left and 1 step down from where the observer is. Wait, the observation lists objects relative to the player's position? Or is it relative to some origin? This is a bit confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the player's position is the center, and the objects are listed with their relative positions. For example, ""wall 5 steps to the right and 4 step up"" means there's a wall 5 steps to the right and 4 up from the player's current position.

In that case, to move towards the ""is"" block at 1 step down, I need to move down once. Let's check if moving down is possible. There's a wall at 3 steps to the right and 1 step up, but that's not in the way of moving down. The ""door"" is at 1 step to the left, which is also not blocking movement down. So moving down should be possible.

Once I move down, I'm at the position of the ""is"" block (1 step down). Then, I can pick up that ""is"" block (since it's not a stop) and move it to the ""win"" rule. The ""win"" rule is at 8 steps right and 5 steps up, with its ""is"" at 9 steps right and 5 steps up. So if I move the ""is"" from the ""you"" rule to after ""win"", the new rule would be ""win is you"", making touching the win object result in victory.

To do that, I need to navigate from the ""is"" block at 1 step down to the ""win"" area. The path might involve moving right and up, but there are walls at 5 steps right. So perhaps a detour is needed. Alternatively, move the ""is"" block to the ""win"" rule's position by moving it left, up, and right as needed.

Alternatively, take the ""is"" block from the ""baba"" rule (which is part of ""baba is you"" at 7 steps right and 5 steps up) and move it to connect with ""door"" or ""win"".

But this requires understanding the exact positions. Let me try to visualize the map.

Assuming the player is at the origin (0,0), the objects are placed relative to that. So:

- Wall at (5,4)
- ""is"" at (9,4)
- ""win"" at (10,4)
- ""wall"" at (-2,3)
- ""stop"" at (1,3)
- Key at (1,4)
- Walls from (3,4) down to (3,1)
- ""is"" at (4,1)
- Key at (7,1)
- Door at (-1,0)
- Wall at (3,0)
- ""baba"" at (-2,-1)
- ""is"" at (-1,-1)
- ""you"" at (0,-1)
- Wall at (3,-1)
- ""door"" rule at (7,-1)

So the player is at (0,0), and Baba is at (-2,-1). The active rule is ""baba is you"", meaning the player can move Baba.

The goal is to reach the ""win"" object at (10,4), but there's a wall at (5,4) and beyond. So need to find a way around.

The ""door"" is at (-1,0). If we can change the door's rule, maybe to ""door is win"", then stepping on the door would make us win. Alternatively, make ""win is door"".

But first, let's see the available ""is"" blocks. There's one at (9,4) (part of ""win is ...""), one at (4,1) (maybe part of ""wall is stop""?), one at (-1,-1) (part of ""you is ...""), and another ""is"" at (7,-1) which is part of the ""door is ..."" rule.

But to create a new rule, we need to connect a subject and a property with an ""is"" block. For example, to make ""door is win"", we need to have the text blocks ""door"", ""is"", ""win"" adjacent.

The ""door"" is at (-1,0), and the ""win"" is at (10,4). The ""is"" at (9,4) is next to ""win"", so if we can move the ""door"" text block next to that ""is"" and ""win"", we could form ""door is win"".

But the ""door"" text block is at (-1,0). To get there, we need to move from Baba's position at (-2,-1). Let's see:

From (-2,-1), moving right once gets to (-1,-1), which is the ""you"" rule. Then moving up to (0,0), then left to (-1,0), which is the door. But there's a wall at (3,0), but that's to the right. So the path from Baba to door would be right, up, left.

Once at the door (position (-1,0)), can we pick it up? The door is an object, but the active rule is ""baba is you"", so unless the door has a rule saying it's movable, we can move it. Since there's no rule restricting moving the door, we can probably move it.

So steps:

1. Move right from Baba's position (-2,-1) to (-1,-1) (the ""you"" rule).
2. Move up to (0,0).
3. Move left to (-1,0) (the door).
4. Pick up the door and move it to the ""is"" block at (9,4) and ""win"" at (10,4), forming ""door is win"".

But that's a long way. Alternatively, maybe there's a closer ""is"" block.

Alternatively, use the ""is"" block at (-1,-1) which is part of ""you is ..."". If we can move that ""is"" to connect ""door"" with ""win"".

From Baba's position (-2,-1):

1. Move right to (-1,-1) (the ""you"" and ""is"" blocks).
2. Pick up the ""is"" block at (-1,-1).
3. Move up to (0,0).
4. Move right to (1,0), but there's a wall at (3,0), so maybe go around?
Wait, the wall at (3,0) is 3 steps to the right from origin. So from (0,0), moving right 3 steps hits a wall. So perhaps need to go up first.

From (0,0), move up to (0,1). Then right to (1,1), but there's a wall at (3,1). Hmm, this might not be the best path.

Alternatively, from (-1,-1), take the ""is"" block and move it to the ""win"" area. The ""win"" is at (10,4), which is far. This seems impractical.

Another approach: Use the ""is"" block at (4,1). If we can move that to connect ""door"" with ""win"".

But again, the distance is too big.

Wait, there's a rule ""rule `door` 8 steps to the right and 1 step down"", which is at (8,-1). So the ""door"" text block is at (8,-1), and the ""is"" there is at (7,-1). So the existing rule is ""door is ..."", but what's after the ""is""? Maybe it's incomplete. If we can add ""win"" after the ""is"", then it becomes ""door is win"".

So to do that, we need to move the ""win"" text block next to the ""is"" at (7,-1). The ""win"" is at (10,4), so that's far. Alternatively, move the ""is"" from (7,-1) to be next to ""win"".

But again, the distance is an issue.

Alternatively, focus on the key. The key is at (1,4). If we can get the key and use it to unlock something, but I don't see a lock object here.

Another idea: Since the active rule is ""baba is you"", maybe we can make ""you is win"" directly. To do that, we need the text blocks ""you"", ""is"", ""win"" adjacent.

The ""you"" is at (0,-1), the ""is"" is at (-1,-1), and the ""win"" is at (10,4). So if we can move the ""is"" from (-1,-1) to between ""you"" and ""win"", but that's a long way.

Alternatively, create a new rule ""you is win"" by placing the ""you"", ""is"", and ""win"" blocks together. But how?

From Baba's position (-2,-1):

1. Move right to (-1,-1) (you and is).
2. Pick up the ""is"" block.
3. Move up to (0,0).
4. Move right to (1,0), but there's a wall at (3,0).
5. Instead, move up to (0,1), then right to (1,1), but again walls at (3,1).
6. This path seems blocked. Maybe another route.

Alternatively, move the ""is"" block down to (0,-1) where ""you"" is. Then place ""win"" next to it. But the ""win"" is at (10,4), so how to get it there?

This is getting too complicated. Maybe a simpler approach: Since the door is at (-1,0), and there's a ""door"" rule at (8,-1), perhaps we can make the door into a win condition.

If we can change the ""door"" rule from whatever it is to ""door is win"", then touching the door would make us win. The existing ""door"" rule is at (8,-1), which is ""door is ..."". The ""is"" there is at (7,-1). So if we can add ""win"" after that ""is"", it becomes ""door is win"".

To do that, we need to move the ""win"" text block to be next to the ""is"" at (7,-1). The ""win"" is at (10,4), so we need to move it left and down. But moving the ""win"" block would require overcoming walls.

Alternatively, use the ""is"" block from somewhere else. For example, the ""is"" at (-1,-1) (part of ""you is ...""). If we move that ""is"" to the ""door"" rule's position:

1. From Baba at (-2,-1), move right to (-1,-1) (you and is).
2. Pick up the ""is"" block.
3. Move up to (0,0).
4. Move right to (1,0), but wall at (3,0).
5. Move up to (0,1).
6. Move right to (1,1), wall at (3,1).
7. Move up to (0,2).
8. Continue moving right until reaching (7,-1) where the ""door"" rule's ""is"" is. But this is a long way and likely blocked by walls.

This seems impractical. Maybe another approach.

What if we make ""key is win""? Then picking up the key would make us win. The key is at (1,4). So if we can create the rule ""key is win"":

1. Get the ""is"" block.
2. Place ""key"" next to ""is"", then ""win"" next to that.

But the ""win"" is at (10,4), far away. To move the ""win"" block, we'd have to move it left 4 steps, which is possible if there's no stop rule blocking.

But the ""stop"" rule is at (1,3), which is up and to the right. Not directly in the way.

So from Baba's position:

1. Move right to (-1,-1) (you and is).
2. Pick up the ""is"" block.
3. Move up to (0,0).
4. Move right to (1,0), but wall at (3,0).
5. Move up to (0,1).
6. Move right to (1,1), wall at (3,1).
7. Move up to (0,2","

Let's try to figure out the next move here. The active rule is still ""baba is you,"" which means I'm controlled by Baba. The goal is usually to reach the ""win"" object, but that might change if rules are altered.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a door at 1 step to the left, and there's a ""rule door"" at 6 steps to the right and 1 step down. The ""win"" object is 8 steps to the right and 5 steps up, but I can't move through walls. There's a key at 1 step right and 4 steps up, but I don't know if I need it yet.

The current position of Baba seems to be at 2 steps to the left and 1 step down. So, if I move down from there, maybe I can position myself to interact with the ""is"" text blocks. The rule ""you"" is at 1 step down, so if I can combine ""baba"" with ""you"" by moving them together, maybe I can become the ""you"" subject. Wait, but ""baba is you"" is already a rule, so maybe that's already set. 

Alternatively, the ""door"" might be a stop or can be manipulated. If I can change ""door"" to ""win,"" then stepping on it would make me win. To do that, I need to move the ""win"" text block next to ""door"" and ""is."" Let me check the positions. The ""is"" rule is at 1 step left and 1 step down, and the ""door"" rule is at 6 steps right and 1 step down. The ""win"" rule is up higher. Maybe I need to move the ""is"" and ""win"" blocks closer to the door.

But how do I move the text blocks? They must not be ""stop."" Looking at the objects, the ""stop"" property is at 1 step left and 4 steps up. So, the walls and some other objects are stops. The ""is"" blocks at 7 steps right and 5 up, 2 steps right and 1 step up, and 1 step left and 1 step down. To move an ""is"" block, I need to be adjacent to it and not blocked by a stop. 

If I move down from my current position (2 left, 1 down) to 1 step down, where the ""you"" rule is. Then maybe I can push the ""is"" block at 1 left and 1 down. Wait, but the ""is"" there is part of ""rule `is` 1 step to the left and 1 step down."" So, if I can move that ""is"" block next to ""door"" and ""win,"" I could create ""door is win,"" making the door a win. 

So steps would be: move down to the ""is"" block, then move it to the door's position. But first, need to navigate avoiding walls. The path might require moving left or right to reach the ""is"" block. Alternatively, maybe move right towards the ""key"" to get a different rule, but I don't know if the key is useful here. 

Another angle: since I'm Baba and ""baba is you,"" maybe I can just walk to the door if it's not a stop. But the door's property isn't clear. There's a ""rule door"" at 6 steps right and 1 step down, which might mean door has some property. If I can turn that into ""win,"" then stepping on door would work. 

Alternatively, check if the existing rules can be reinterpreted. The current active rule is only ""baba is you."" The other rules like ""win is..."" are present but not active unless moved. So the goal is to create a rule like ""door is win"" by moving the existing ""is"" and ""win"" blocks next to ""door.""

So the plan is: locate the ""is"" block that's not part of an active rule, move it next to ""door"" and ""win,"" then combine them. But where is the free ""is"" block? Looking at the objects, there's a rule `is` at 7 steps right and 5 up (part of the upper rules), another at 2 steps right and 1 step up, and one at 1 step left and 1 step down. The one at 1 step left and 1 step down is part of ""rule `is` 1 step to the left and 1 step down,"" which is adjacent to the ""you"" rule. 

If I can move that ""is"" block down to the door's position. Let's see the positions:

- Current ""is"" block: 1 step left and 1 step down (same as the ""you"" rule's position? Wait, the ""you"" rule is at 1 step down, so the ""is"" is at 1 step left and 1 step down. The door is at 1 step to the left. So the door's position is 1 step left, same level as the ""is"" and ""you"" rules. 

So if I can move the ""is"" block from (1 left, 1 down) to (door's position, which is 1 left), then place the ""win"" block next to it. The ""win"" block is at 8 steps right and 5 up, which is way up high. That's not nearby. Alternatively, maybe there's another ""win"" rule elsewhere? No, the active rules only show ""baba is you,"" and the other rules are static text blocks.

Wait, the objects list includes ""rule `win` 10 steps to the right and 4 step up"" in earlier observations, but in the current observation, the ""win"" rule is at 8 steps right and 5 up. So it's up high. To get there, I need to move up, but there are walls blocking the path. 

Alternatively, use the key to unlock something? Not sure. The key is at 1 step right and 4 step up, but surrounded by walls. Maybe moving right to get the key first, but that might not help.

Back to the main idea: to create ""door is win,"" I need the ""door"" text block, an ""is"" text block, and the ""win"" text block adjacent. The door is at 1 step left. There's an ""is"" at 1 step left and 1 step down. The ""win"" is up high. Maybe it's impossible to reach the ""win"" block from here. 

Alternatively, use the existing ""win"" rule that's part of the upper structure. But how? If I can move the ""is"" block down to the door's level and combine it with ""win,"" but the ""win"" is up high. 

Alternatively, change the ""win"" condition to Baba. If I can make ""baba is win,"" then stepping on Baba (which I am) would make me win. To do that, I need to move the ""win"" text block next to ""baba"" and an ""is"" block. 

Baba's current position is at 2 step left and 1 step down. There's an ""is"" block at 1 step left and 1 step down. If I can move that ""is"" block next to Baba and the ""win"" block, then create ""baba is win."" 

So steps:

1. Move from current position (2 left, 1 down) to the ""is"" block at (1 left, 1 down). Move left once.

2. Then, move the ""is"" block towards Baba. Since I'm pushing it, need to be adjacent and not blocked. The ""is"" is at 1 left, 1 down. Baba is at 2 left, 1 down. So if I move left from the ""is"" block, pushing it to 0 left, 1 down. But is there a wall there? Looking at the map, wall 3 steps to the right and various positions, but not sure about 0 left. Maybe it's clear.

3. Once the ""is"" is next to Baba, place the ""win"" block. But the ""win"" block is at 8 right, 5 up. That's too far. Alternatively, use the existing ""win"" rule that's part of the upper structure. Maybe there's a ""win"" text block nearby that's not activated yet.

Alternatively, the active rules only show ""baba is you,"" but there are other rules on the map that can be moved. For example, the ""win"" rule at 8 right and 5 up. To reach it, need to move up and right, but there are walls. 

This is getting complicated. Maybe the intended solution is to move the ""is"" block next to the door and the ""win"" block to make ""door is win."" But how?

Alternatively, the door is a stop, but if I can change its property. Since I'm Baba and can push text blocks, maybe move the ""is"" to the door's position and attach the ""win"" there. 

Wait, the door's current rule is ""rule `door` 8 steps to the right and 2 steps down"" in earlier observations, but in the current map, the ""rule door"" is at 7 steps right and 1 step down. So the door object is at 1 step left, and there's a rule block saying ""door"" at 7 right, 1 down. 

If I can move the ""win"" block (which is up high) down to near the door, but that's difficult. Alternatively, use the existing ""win"" rule that's part of the upper structure. 

Another approach: since I'm Baba and ""baba is you,"" maybe I can just walk into the door if it's not a stop. But the door's property isn't clear. If the door is a stop, I can't pass. If not, I can. Let me check the objects. There's a ""rule `stop` 1 step to the right and 3 step up,"" but that's a different position. The door itself doesn't have a rule attached in the current observation. So perhaps the door is not a stop, meaning I can walk through it. If that's the case, then maybe the goal is to reach the door, and since the default win condition might be touching the door, but that's not stated. 

Alternatively, the win condition is still the original ""win"" object up high, but I can't reach it due to walls. So the only way is to alter the rules. 

Given the time I've spent and the previous failed actions, maybe the correct move is to move down towards the ""is"" and ""you"" rules to manipulate them. So from the current position (2 left, 1 down), moving down to 1 step down, where the ""you"" rule is. Then, move left to reach the ""is"" block at 1 left, 1 down. Once there, push the ""is"" block to the door's position (1 left). Then, if there's a ""win"" block nearby, combine them. But the ""win"" is up high. 

Alternatively, move right to get to the ""key"" and then use it to unlock something, but I'm not sure how. 

Considering the previous actions tried (left, right, down) and the fact that the last valid action was ""down"" leading to this state, maybe the next step is to continue moving down to interact with the ""is"" and ""you"" rules. So moving down again.

Let's try to figure out how to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. The current observation shows that Baba is you, so I can move around. The active rules are ""baba is you,"" which means whatever I do, Baba can do it.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a door to the left, and a rule `door` positioned 6 steps to the right and 1 step down. The win condition is still ""win"" at 8 steps to the right and 5 steps up, but I need to check if that's still the case. 

I see a key at 1 step to the right and 4 steps up. Maybe I need to pick up the key to unlock something? But there's a rule `stop` at 1 step to the left and 4 steps up, which might be a wall or an immovable object. 

The door is nearby at 1 step to the left. If I can reach the door, maybe I can rearrange the rules to make the door no longer a stop or a wall. The rule `door` is at 6 steps to the right and 1 step down, so perhaps moving that rule near the actual door object could change its property. 

Also, there's a rule `you` at 1 step down. Since I'm Baba and ""baba is you,"" maybe combining ""baba"" with another rule could make me something else. For example, if I move ""baba"" next to ""win,"" I could create ""baba is win,"" which would make me the win condition. 

Wait, the current active rules are ""baba is you."" If I can create a new rule like ""you is win,"" that might make me win. To do that, I need to move the ""you"" text block next to ""win."" Let me check the positions. The `you` rule is at 1 step down, and the `win` rule is at 8 steps to the right and 5 steps up. That's quite far. Maybe there's a shorter path. 

Alternatively, maybe I can push the `door` rule to be next to the actual door object. The door is at 1 step to the left, and the `door` rule is at 6 steps to the right and 1 step down. If I can move that rule closer to the door, perhaps I can change its behavior. But how? I need to move the `door` text block. 

Looking at the movement options, I'm currently positioned where the `baba` rule is at 2 steps to the left and 1 step down. To move the `door` rule, I might need to go to its location (6 steps right, 1 down) and then move it towards the door. But first, I need to navigate there. 

Wait, the `is` rules are spread out. Maybe I can use an `is` rule to create a new rule. For example, if I can get ""baba is door"" and ""door is win,"" then maybe combining those would make Baba win. But I need to move the existing `is` rules to form these new combinations. 

Alternatively, since I'm Baba and can push objects that aren't stopped, maybe I can push the `door` rule block to the door. Let's see: the `door` rule is at 6 steps right and 1 step down. The actual door is at 1 step left. So moving the `door` rule from 6 right, 1 down to 1 left would require moving left multiple times. But I need to check if there are any stoppers in the way. 

Looking at the walls: there's a wall at 5 steps right in various positions. So moving left from the current position might be possible if there's no wall blocking. The current position of Baba is at the `baba` rule block at 2 left, 1 down. To move left, I need to check if there's a wall there. The walls are at 5 steps right in different vertical positions, but not necessarily to the left. So moving left should be possible. 

But wait, the `stop` rule is at 1 step left and 4 steps up. That might affect movement in that area, but since I'm Baba and can move unless stopped by a ""stop"" property. However, ""baba is you"" means I can override stops unless the object is explicitly stopped. Wait, the `stop` rule is at 1 left, 4 up. If I try to move into that area, would it block me? Since ""baba is you,"" and ""you"" can push unless stopped, but if the object is stopped, like a wall with ""stop,"" then I can't move through it. But in this case, the `stop` rule is a text block, not an object. The actual walls are separate. 

This is getting a bit confusing. Let me recap the goal: the usual win condition is to reach the `win` rule, which is at 8 right, 5 up. But maybe I can change the win condition by moving rules. For example, if I make ""baba is win,"" then touching the `win` block would make me win. 

To do that, I need to move the `win` rule next to ""baba."" The `win` rule is at 8 right, 5 up, and the `baba` rule is at 2 left, 1 down. That's a significant distance. Alternatively, maybe create a new rule ""you is win"" since I'm you. The `you` rule is at 1 step down. If I can move that next to the `win` rule, then ""you is win"" would make me win. 

So the plan would be: move the `you` rule (which is at 1 step down) to the `win` rule (8 right, 5 up). But that's a long way. Alternatively, move the `win` rule next to `you`. 

Alternatively, use an `is` rule to connect them. The nearest `is` rule is at 2 steps right and 1 step up. Maybe I can move that `is` rule to between `you` and `win`. 

Let me think about the positions again. Current `you` is at 1 step down. The `is` rule at 2 right, 1 up. Maybe I can move down to the `you` rule, then move right to the `is` rule, then move up and right to the `win` rule. 

But how do I move? Each action is a single step. Let's see: my current position is where the `baba` rule is located: 2 left, 1 down. To get to the `you` rule at 1 step down, I need to move down once. Then, from there, move right to the `is` rule at 2 right, 1 up. Wait, but the `is` rule is at 2 steps right and 1 step up from where? Maybe I need to check coordinates more carefully. 

Alternatively, perhaps the key is to push the `door` rule to the actual door. The door is at 1 step left, and the `door` rule is at 6 right, 1 down. If I can move that `door` rule to the door's location, then maybe the door becomes passable or changes its property. 

To move the `door` rule block, I need to be adjacent to it and move in a direction. The `door` rule is at 6 steps right and 1 step down. My current position is at 2 left, 1 down. So to reach the `door` rule, I need to move right 8 times and up 0. But there are walls at 5 steps right, so moving right past that would be blocked. Hmm, that's a problem. 

Wait, the walls are at 5 steps right in various positions (4 up, 3 up, etc.), but maybe there's a path around. Let's see: from my current position (2 left, 1 down), moving right towards the `door` rule at 6 right, 1 down. But there's a wall at 5 right, so I can't go past that. So that path is blocked. 

Alternative approach: use the existing `is` rules to create a new rule. For example, if I can make ""baba is door"" and ""door is win,"" then touching a door would make me win. To do that, I need to move the `door` rule next to ""baba"" and then connect it to ""win."" 

But again, the `door` rule is at 6 right, 1 down, which is blocked by walls. Maybe there's another way. 

Wait, there's a `key` at 1 right, 4 up. Maybe picking up the key allows me to unlock something, but I don't see a lock in the observation. 

Another thought: the `stop` rule is at 1 left, 4 up. If I can remove that rule or change its property, maybe paths become unblocked. But how? To delete a rule, I need to push it off the screen, I think. But the game might not allow that. 

Alternatively, create a rule that negates ""stop."" For example, ""stop is not stop,"" but I don't know if that's possible. 

Wait, in Baba Is You, you can push text blocks to create or break rules. So if there's a ""stop"" rule, and I can push it away, maybe that removes the stop property. But the `stop` rule here is a text block, so if I push it off the map, the rule ""stop"" would no longer exist, removing the stop property from whatever it was applying to. 

But the `stop` rule is at 1 left, 4 up. To push it, I need to be next to it and move in a direction. My current position is 2 left, 1 down. To reach the `stop` rule, I need to move left 3 steps and up 3 steps. But there's a wall at 5 right, which is in the opposite direction. Wait, the walls are to the right, so moving left should be possible. 

Let me map this out. Current position: relative to where? The observations mention positions relative to the player, I assume. For example, ""wall 3 steps to the right and 5 step up"" means there's a wall 3 steps to the right and 5 steps up from the player's current position. 

So the player is somewhere, and objects are positioned relative to that. To move left, the player would decrease their x-coordinate. 

The `stop` rule is at 1 left, 4 up. So from the player's current position (let's assume it's at (0,0)), the `stop` rule is at (-1, 4). The player needs to move left to (-1,4) to interact with it. But the player's current position is where the `baba` rule is: 2 left, 1 down, which would be (-2, -1). 

So to get to the `stop` rule at (-1,4), the player needs to move right once (from -2 to -1 in x), then up four times. But along the way, are there any walls? Let's check the walls:

- wall 5 steps to the right and 4 step up: that's (5,4)
- wall 3 steps to the right and 5 step up: (3,5)
- Other walls are at 5 steps right in lower positions.

So moving from (-2, -1) to (-1,4): moving right to (-1, -1), then up to (-1,0), (-1,1), (-1,2), (-1,3), (-1,4). There are no walls mentioned in that path except possibly the ones at 5 steps right, which are in the positive x direction. So this path should be clear. 

Once at the `stop` rule, the player can push it in a direction. To remove the ""stop"" rule, maybe pushing it off the screen. If the game allows pushing rules off the edges, then pushing the `stop` rule left or up beyond the map would remove it. 

But how does pushing work? In Baba Is You, you can push a text block by moving towards it in the direction you want to push. So if the `stop` rule is at (-1,4), and the player is at (-1,4), they can move left or up to push it. 

If the player moves left from (-1,4) to (-2,4), that would push the `stop` rule left off the screen, removing the ""stop"" rule. That could open up a path. 

Alternatively, moving up from (-1,4) to (-1,5) would push it up, also removing the rule. 

This might be a way to remove obstacles. 

Once the `stop` rule is removed, maybe the path to the `win` rule is clear. 

Alternatively, creating a new rule ""baba is win"" by moving the `win` rule next to ""baba."" The `win` rule is at (8,5), and ""baba"" is at (-2,-1). Distance is too big, but maybe using intermediates. 

Another idea: use the `is` rule at (7,5) to connect ""baba"" and ""win."" If I can move the `is` rule between ""baba"" and ""win,"" then ""baba is win"" would be created. 

To do that, the player needs to move the `is` rule from (7,5) to between ""baba"" at (-2,-1) and ""win"" at (8,5). That's a huge distance, but perhaps possible by moving the `is` rule step by step. 

Alternatively, create a new `is` rule nearby. For example, move an `is` block to connect ""baba"" with ""win."" 

But this seems complicated. Maybe a simpler approach is to push the `you` rule next to the `win` rule. The `you` rule is at (1,-1) (since it's 1 step down from the player's position at (0,0)), and the `win` rule is at (8,5). To move the `you` rule to (8,5), the player would need to move right 7 times and up 5 times, which is blocked by walls. 

Hmm. Maybe I should focus on the door. The door is at 1 step left (x=-1, y=0), and the `door` rule is at (6,1). If I can move the `door` rule to the door's location, then the rule would apply to the door object. For example, if the rule is ""door is key,"" then the door could be opened with the key. 

To move the `door` rule from (6,1) to (-1,0), the player would need to move left 7 times and up -1 (down). But the path might be blocked by walls. 

Looking at the walls: at x=5, various y positions. So moving left from x=6 to x=5 is blocked by a wall. So that path is impossible. 

Alternative plan: use the key. The key is at (1,4). If I can pick up the key and use it on the door. But in Baba Is You, you usually push objects, not pick them up. However, if there's a ""key is win"" rule, touching the key would make you win. 

But to create ""key is win,"" I need to move the `win` rule next to the `key` rule. The `key` is at (1,4), and `win` is at (8,5). Again, distance is an issue. 

This is quite challenging. Maybe I need to look for a closer rule to manipulate. 

The `is` rule at (2,1) is nearby. If I can use that to create a new rule. For example, move ""is"" next to ""baba"" and ""win"" to make ""baba is win."" 

The player's current position is at the `baba` rule at (-2,-1). The `is` rule is at (2,1). So moving right to (2,1), then moving up to (2,2), etc., but again, walls might block. 

Alternatively, move the `is` rule from (7,5) down to near the player. 

Wait, the `is` rule at (7,5) is quite far up. The player is at (-2,-1). To move that `is` rule down, the player would need to navigate there, which is difficult due to walls. 

Perhaps the key is to interact with the `you` rule. Since the player is Baba and ""baba is you,"" maybe creating a rule like ""you is win"" would make the player win. The `you` rule is at (1,-1). The `win` rule is at (8,5). To move the `you` rule to (8,5), it's a long way, but maybe possible by pushing it step by step. 

Alternatively, use the existing `is` rule at (2,1) to connect `you` and `win`. If I can move the `is` rule to be between `you` and `win`, then ""you is win"" would be created. 

To do that, the player needs to move the `is` rule from (2,1) to (1,-1) (position of `you`) and then to (8,5). But this seems impractical. 

Another approach: Since the door is at ( -1,0 ), and the `door` rule is at (6,1), maybe pushing the `door` rule to ( -1,0 ) would make the rule ""door"" apply to the door object. If the rule is ""door is win,"" then touching the door would make you win. 

But how to get the `door` rule to the door's location? The distance is too great, and there are walls in the way. 

Wait, maybe there's a different `is` rule that can be used. The `is` rule at (4,1) is closer. If I can move that `is` rule to connect `door` and `win`, but again, the `door` rule is at (6,1), and `win` is at (8,5). 

This is really tricky. Maybe I should try a different strategy. Let's look at the current active rules again: only ""baba is you."" All other rules are text blocks that can be moved. 

The goal is to reach the `win` rule or change the win condition. Since the `win` rule is far away, perhaps creating a new rule that makes reaching a different object count as winning. 

For example, if I can make ""key is win,"" then picking up the key would make me win. The key is at (1,4).","

Let's see. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I can move and interact with text blocks. The goal is usually to reach a ""win"" condition, but maybe that's changed here.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a door to the left. But doors are often ""stop"" unless there's a rule saying otherwise. Wait, the current active rules only have ""baba is you."" So, the door is probably a stop, meaning I can't push past it. But since I'm Baba and ""you,"" maybe I can walk through it if the rule is changed. 

There's a key near the top, but it's blocked by walls. The rule ""is"" blocks are scattered. The ""rule `you`"" is at 1 step down, 1 step to the right. If I can get to that rule, maybe I can move it to combine with another rule. For example, if I move ""you"" onto ""baba,"" then ""baba is you"" would become a rule, making me the you. Wait, but I already am ""you"" because the active rule is ""baba is you."" Hmm, maybe not. 

Alternatively, maybe I need to create a new rule like ""door is win"" so stepping on the door makes me win. To do that, I need to move the ""win"" rule somewhere else and replace it with ""door is win."" But the ""win"" rule is at 8 steps right and 5 up. The ""door"" is at 1 step left. So I need to navigate to those text blocks. 

Looking at my position, I think I'm currently where the ""baba"" rule is, which is 2 steps left and 1 step down. To get to the ""door"" rule, which is 1 step left, I need to move left. But there's a wall 3 steps to the right, so maybe I can move around it. Wait, the walls are to the right and up. Maybe I can move left towards the door. 

But the ""stop"" rule is at 1 step left and 4 step up. Not sure if that affects anything. The key is at 1 step right and 4 step up, but it's blocked by walls. Maybe I don't need the key. 

The plan: Move left to reach the ""door"" rule. Then, move the ""door"" rule next to the ""is"" rule and the ""win"" rule to create ""door is win."" But first, I need to get past the walls. Alternatively, move the ""is"" rule that's 2 steps right and 1 step up to combine with ""door"" and ""win."" 

Wait, the ""is"" rule is at 2 steps right and 1 step up. If I can move that down to where the ""door"" is, then place ""door is win"" there. But how to move the ""is"" rule? I need to be adjacent to it and not be stopped. Since I'm Baba and ""you,"" maybe I can move objects that aren't stopped. The ""is"" rule isn't stopped, so I can pick it up. 

So, possible steps:
1. Move from my current position (2 left, 1 down) to the ""is"" rule at 2 right, 1 up. But that's opposite direction. Maybe I need to move right first? Wait, my position might be different. Let me visualize the map.

Assuming the player is at the position of the ""baba"" rule, which is 2 steps left and 1 step down. The ""is"" rule is 2 steps right and 1 step up. So to reach it, I need to move right twice and up once. But the way might be blocked by walls. Let's check the walls:

There's a wall at 3 steps right and various ups. So moving right from my position (assuming starting at 0,0) might hit a wall at 3 steps right. Wait, the walls are positioned at 5 steps right in some directions, which might be outside my current area. Maybe the layout is such that I can navigate around.

Alternatively, focus on the ""you"" rule at 1 step down. If I can move the ""you"" rule onto ""baba,"" making ""baba is you"" a permanent rule. But that's already the active rule. Hmm.

Another angle: The ""door"" is a stop unless there's a rule saying ""door is not stop."" But currently, the only rule is ""baba is you."" So the door is stop. To pass through, I need to change the rule to make door not stop. For that, I can create ""door is not stop"" by moving the ""not"" rule, but I don't see a ""not"" rule here. Alternatively, ""door is win"" so stepping on it wins.

To make ""door is win,"" I need to move the ""win"" rule next to ""door"" and ""is."" The ""win"" rule is at 8 steps right and 5 up. That's quite far. Maybe there's a shorter path.

Alternatively, use the existing ""is"" rule at 7 steps right and 5 up. Wait, no, the ""is"" rule mentioned is at 7 steps right and 5 up. The ""win"" is at 8 steps right and 5 up. So if I can move the ""win"" rule one step left next to ""is"" and ""door,"" then create ""door is win.""

But how to get there? The walls are at 3 steps right and 4 step up, etc. Maybe the path is blocked. Alternatively, focus on the lower part of the map where the ""door"" is at 1 step left. If I can get to that area, maybe I can manipulate the rules there.

My current position is at the ""baba"" rule, which is 2 steps left and 1 step down. To get to the ""door"" at 1 step left, I need to move left once. But is there a wall in between? The walls are at 3 steps right, so if I'm moving left, there's a wall 3 steps to the right, which is not in my path. So moving left should be possible.

So action: left. Then, once at the ""door"" rule's position, I can pick up the ""is"" rule that's 1 step to the left and 1 step down, and place it next to ""door"" and ""win"" to create ""door is win.""

Let's try to figure out the next move here. The active rules are still ""baba is you,"" which means I can move around and manipulate the text blocks.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ""door"" 1 step to the left and another door at 7 steps to the right, 1 step down. The key is at 2 steps right and 4 up, but I'm not sure if I need it yet. The walls are forming a pathway, and there are some ""is"" rules scattered around.

The goal is usually to reach the ""win"" object, which is at 9 steps right and 5 up. But since rules can change, maybe I need to adjust what counts as a win. Also, there's a ""you"" rule at 1 step right and 1 down, which might be important. 

The ""baba"" text block is at 1 step left and 1 down. If I can move that, maybe I can reposition it to create a new rule. For example, if I move ""baba"" next to the ""win"" rule, I could potentially make ""baba is win"" or something else. 

The ""is"" rule blocks are key here. If I can move an ""is"" next to ""baba"" and ""win,"" then I can create a new rule that makes baba the win. That would let me step on the win tile. 

Right now, the ""you"" rule is at 1 step right and 1 down. If I move ""baba"" there and pair it with an ""is"" rule, maybe I can make baba the you, but since I'm already you because of the initial rule, that might not be necessary. 

Looking at the positions, the ""is"" rule at 3 steps right and 1 step up is close to the key. If I can get to that ""is"" and combine it with ""baba"" and ""win,"" that could work. But the path might be blocked by walls. 

Wait, the walls are at 4 steps right in various directions. Maybe I need to move left or down to get to the ""is"" rules. The current position of Baba seems to be at 1 step left and 1 down, based on the ""baba"" object's location. 

So, possible actions: move towards the ""is"" rule at 3 steps right and 1 up, but there's a wall at 4 steps right. Alternatively, move down to reach the ""you"" rule and ""is"" at 1 step down. 

If I move down once, I can get to the ""is"" at 1 step down and the ""you"" there. Then, if I can move ""baba"" next to the ""win"" rule, that would create the necessary rule. 

But how do I move the text blocks? I need to move them to adjacent tiles, avoiding ""stop"" objects. The ""stop"" is at 4 step up, which might be a wall. 

So, the plan is: move down to reach the ""is"" and ""you"" rules, then move ""baba"" to the ""win"" location using an ""is"" block. Then, the rule ""baba is win"" would make stepping on the win tile succeed. 

Therefore, the next action should be to move down to get closer to those rules. Alternatively, move left to reach the ""is"" at 3 steps right and 1 up, but there's a wall at 4 steps right. Maybe moving left isn't the way. 

Wait, the current position of Baba is 1 step left and 1 down. To get to the ""is"" at 1 step down, I need to move down once. Then, from there, I can push the ""is"" block next to ""baba"" and ""win."" 

So the best action now is to move down.

Let me try to figure out what to do next in this Baba Is You level. The current active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means that whatever I do, I can move around since I'm Baba. The goal is usually to reach the ""win"" object, but I need to check if that's still the case.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see there's a ""door"" object mentioned. The rule ""door 7 steps to the right and 1 step down"" might be important. But wait, the active rules don't mention anything about the door being a win condition or passable. In most levels, the door is something you need to reach, but maybe here the win condition is different. Let me check the active rules again. The rules listed are ""baba is you,"" and then there are some wall and stop rules. There's no rule specifying that ""door is win"" or something similar, so the win condition must still be elsewhere, probably the ""win"" object that's 9 steps to the right and 5 steps up. But how do I get there?

Looking at the map layout, there are several walls blocking the path upwards. The key is at 2 steps to the right and 4 steps up. Maybe I need to get the key first to unlock something? But the key is behind a wall at 3 steps to the right and 4 steps up. Wait, there's a rule ""is"" at 7 steps to the right and 5 steps up. Maybe I can move that ""is"" text block to create a new rule. For example, if I can make ""baba is win"" or ""door is win,"" that would change the goal. 

But how do I move the text blocks? The instructions say I can move objects or text that aren't defined as ""STOP"" or similar. The current rules have ""stop"" at 4 steps up, but the walls are made of ""wall,"" which might be stoppable. So I need to find a way to reach the ""is"" text blocks to rearrange the rules. Let's see the positions again:

- The ""is"" rule is at 7 steps to the right and 5 steps up. That's up high, blocked by walls. 
- There's another ""is"" at 3 steps to the right and 1 step up. Maybe I can move that one first. 

If I can move the ""is"" at 3 steps right and 1 up, I might be able to create a new rule like ""baba is key"" or ""key is you,"" but I'm not sure. Alternatively, if I can move the ""you"" rule (which is at 1 step to the right and 1 step down), maybe I can make Baba the ""you"" by swapping the ""you"" with ""baba."" 

Wait, the current rules are ""baba is you,"" so Baba is both the subject and the you. But if I can change the ""you"" rule to something else, maybe I can free up the ""you"" property for another object. For example, if I make ""key is you,"" then I could pick up the key and use it to unlock a door. But to do that, I need to move the ""you"" text block. 

Looking at the positions, the ""you"" is at 1 step to the right and 1 step down. That's near the bottom of the map. If I move down to that position, I might be able to push the ""you"" text block. But I need to check if there are any stop properties blocking the way. The walls are at 4 steps right and various ups, but the path to the ""you"" rule seems clear. 

Alternatively, the ""is"" rule at 3 steps right and 1 step up could be moved. If I move that ""is"" to combine with the ""baba"" or ""you"" rules, maybe I can create a new rule like ""baba is door"" making the door win. But I need to get to that ""is"" block first. 

Another approach: since I'm Baba and I can move, maybe I can push the walls if they aren't labeled as stop. The walls are labeled as ""wall,"" but unless there's a ""stop"" rule on them, I should be able to push them. Wait, the active rules have ""rule `stop` 4 step up,"" which might mean that anything at 4 steps up is stoppable. The walls at 4 steps right and 4 steps up are probably stop, so I can't push them. That blocks the path upwards. 

So, maybe I need to find a way to remove the stop property from the walls or create a new rule that allows me to pass through them. For example, if I can make ""wall is stop"" (which it already is), but that doesn't help. Alternatively, if I can change ""stop"" to something else. 

Looking at the objects, the ""stop"" rule is at 4 step up. If I can move that ""stop"" rule to a different position, perhaps I can redefine what's stoppable. For example, moving ""stop"" to a wall, making the wall not stop. But how? The ""stop"" rule is a text block, so if I can move it, I can place it somewhere else. 

The ""stop"" rule is currently at 4 step up. If I move it down or to the side, then the walls might no longer be stop. But to move the ""stop"" rule, I need to be able to push it. Since I'm Baba and ""baba is you,"" I can push objects unless they're stop. But the ""stop"" rule itself—does it make the text block it's applied to stop? Or does it make the object it's referencing stop? This is a bit unclear. 

Alternatively, maybe the ""stop"" rule means that any object labeled as stop cannot be moved. So if I can remove the ""stop"" label from the walls, they become movable. To do that, I need to find the ""stop"" rule and move it away. The ""stop"" rule is a separate object; it's at 4 step up. If I can move that text block, say, to the ground, then the walls wouldn't have the stop property anymore. 

So the plan could be: move the ""stop"" rule from 4 step up to somewhere else, like next to a wall, effectively removing the stop property from that wall. Then, I could push the walls out of the way to access the upper areas. 

To move the ""stop"" rule, I need to be adjacent to it. The ""stop"" rule is at 4 step up. Looking at the map, my current position isn't specified, but the ""baba"" object is at 1 step to the left and 1 step down. So I'm probably located there. Let's assume I'm at the position of the ""baba"" object: 1 step left and 1 step down. 

From there, I need to move towards the ""stop"" rule at 4 step up. The path upwards is blocked by walls, but if I can move the walls by removing their stop property, then I can proceed. Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule first. 

To move the ""stop"" rule, which is at 4 step up, I need to be adjacent to it. My current position is 1 step left and 1 step down. Let's see the coordinates. If ""baba"" is at 1 step left and 1 step down, then moving up would take me to adjacent objects. Let's say moving up from my position would bring me to the area with walls at 3 steps right and 4 step up. But those walls are stoppable. 

Alternatively, maybe I should first move to the ""is"" rule at 3 steps right and 1 step up. From my current position (1 left, 1 down), moving right twice and up once would get me there. But the path might be blocked. Let's check: moving right once gets me to neutral, then right again to 2 steps right, then up to 1 step up. Along the way, are there any stop objects? The walls are at 4 steps right, so I should be able to move right until I hit a wall. Wait, the walls are at 4 steps right and various ups. So from my position (1 left, 1 down), moving right three times would get me to 3 steps right, which is where the ""is"" rule is located at 1 step up. So that path seems clear. 

Once I reach the ""is"" rule at 3 steps right and 1 step up, I can push it. Since it's a text block and I'm Baba (you), I can move it unless it's stop. The ""is"" rule itself isn't stop, so I can move it. If I move it to combine with the ""you"" rule, maybe I can create a new rule like ""you is win"" or something. 

Alternatively, moving the ""is"" rule next to the ""baba"" rule (which is at 1 step left and 2 steps down) could create a new rule. For example, if I move the ""is"" to the right of ""baba,"" it would make ""baba is [something]."" But what's the something? There's a ""you"" rule at 1 step right and 1 step down. Maybe combining ""baba is you"" with another ""is"" to make ""baba is win"" by placing ""win"" next to it. 

Wait, the ""win"" rule is at 9 steps right and 5 steps up, which is far away. Maybe that's not feasible. 

Alternatively, if I can make ""door is win,"" then reaching the door would make me win. The door is at 1 step left, so if I can push the door, but it's probably stoppable. 

Another angle: the key is at 2 steps right and 4 steps up. If I can get the key, maybe I can use it to unlock the door. But how? In Baba Is You, sometimes keys unlock doors if there's a rule like ""key unlocks door."" But currently, there's no such rule. So unless I can create that rule by moving text blocks. For example, if I move ""is"" next to ""key"" and ""door,"" making ""key is door"" or ""key unlocks door."" 

But to do that, I need to gather the necessary text blocks. The ""is"" rule is available, but the ""unlocks"" property isn't on the map. So maybe that's not possible. 

Let me recap the possible actions:

1. Move towards the ""is"" rules to create new rules.
2. Move the ""stop"" rule to remove stop properties from walls.
3. Interact with the key and door.
4. Change the ""you"" rule to allow movement through doors or other objects.

Given that the active rule is ""baba is you,"" I can move freely unless blocked by stop. The main obstacles are the walls labeled as stop. If I can remove the stop property from the walls, I can push them. 

To remove the stop property, I need to move the ""stop"" rule. The ""stop"" rule is at 4 step up. My current position is 1 step left and 1 step down. Let's see the coordinates again:

- ""baba"" is at 1 step left and 1 step down.
- ""is"" at 3 steps right and 1 step up.
- ""stop"" at 4 step up.
- ""key"" at 2 steps right and 4 step up.
- ""win"" at 9 steps right and 5 step up.
- walls blocking the way up.

To reach the ""stop"" rule at 4 step up, I need to move up from my current position. But the path is blocked by walls at 3 steps right and 4 step up. Those walls are stoppable, so I can't push them. Unless I can remove their stop property by moving the ""stop"" rule. 

This seems like a catch-22. To remove the stop property, I need to move the ""stop"" rule, but to move the ""stop"" rule, I need to get past the stoppable walls, which I can't without removing the stop property. 

Alternative approach: use the ""is"" rule at 3 steps right and 1 step up to create a new rule that makes the walls not stop. For example, if I can make ""wall is not stop,"" but how? The available text blocks are ""is,"" ""win,"" ""key,"" ""door,"" etc. Maybe combining ""wall is stop"" into something else. Wait, the current rules have ""rule `wall` 1 step to the left and 4 step up,"" which probably means ""wall is stop"" because the rule is ""wall IS stop."" 

So the existing rule is ""wall is stop."" If I can move the ""is"" next to ""wall"" and change the property, like making ""wall is key"" or something, that would remove the stop property. 

To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to the ""wall"" rule. The ""wall"" rule is at 1 step left and 4 step up. The ""is"" rule I'm interested in is at 3 steps right and 1 step up. That's quite far apart. 

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" at 3 steps right and 1 step up to be next to the ""wall"" rule at 1 step left and 4 step up. But that would require moving it up and left, which might be possible if the path is clear. 

From my current position (1 left, 1 down), moving right three times gets me to 3 steps right, then up to 1 step up (where the ""is"" is). From there, moving up four more steps would reach the ""wall"" rule at 4 step up, but the path is blocked by walls at 3 steps right and 4 step up. Those walls are stoppable, so I can't get past them. 

This is getting complicated. Maybe I should focus on creating a new rule that makes Baba able to push the stop walls. For example, if I can make ""baba is push"" or ""baba can move stop,"" but I don't have the ""push"" or ""move"" text blocks. The available rules are ""is,"" ""win,"" ""key,"" ""door,"" ""wall,"" ""stop,"" etc. 

Alternatively, if I can make ""you is push,"" but since I'm Baba and ""baba is you,"" that would make Baba push. Not sure. 

Wait, the ""you"" rule is at 1 step right and 1 step down. If I can move that ""you"" rule to a different position, say next to ""baba,"" then it would become ""baba is you"" (which it already is) or something else. Maybe moving the ""you"" rule next to the ""key"" could make ""key is you,"" allowing me to pick up the key. 

But how to reach the ""you"" rule? From my current position, moving right once and down once would get me there. Let me check:

- Current position: 1 left, 1 down.
- Moving right once: neutral position (0 steps left/right), 1 down.
- Moving down once: 0 steps right/left, 2 down.
- But the ""you"" rule is at 1 step right and 1 step down. So from my position, moving right once and staying at 1 step down would reach the ""you"" rule. 

Once there, I can push the ""you"" rule. Since it's a text block and I'm Baba (you), I can move it. If I move it to the left next to the ""baba"" rule, it would create ""baba is you you""? That doesn't make sense. Maybe I need to place it next to another rule. For example, moving ""you"" next to ""key"" to make ""key is you,"" which would let me pick up the key. 

But the key is at 2 steps right and 4 step up. That's quite far. 

Alternatively, moving the ""you"" rule next to the ""is"" at 3 steps right and 1 step up to create a new rule like ""is you [something]."" Not sure. 

This is getting too convoluted. Maybe I should try a different approach. Since the goal is usually to reach the ""win"" object, which is far to the right and up, perhaps I need to find a way to create a rule that allows me to float or bypass the walls. 

Another thought: in some levels, you can make the door a win by creating ""door is win."" If I can move the ""win"" rule to be next to ""door,"" that would work. The ""win"" rule is at 9 steps right and 5 step up, and the door is at 1 step left. Those are very far apart, but maybe there's a shorter path if I can move blocks. 

Alternatively, using the key to unlock the door. But without a rule that connects key and door, that's not possible. 

Wait, the ""key"" is at 2 steps right and 4 step up. If I can move the key to the door, which is at 1 step left, I could maybe push it, but the door is probably stoppable. 

Another possibility: since I'm Baba and I can move, maybe I can walk around the walls if there's a path. Looking at the map, the walls are all aligned to the right and up. The only open path seems to be to the left and down. But the door is to the left, and the ""win"" is to the right. 

Wait, the door is 1 step to the left from my current position (if I'm at 1 step left and 1 step down, moving left would take me to the door's position). But the door is at 1 step left, so if I move left from my current position, I'd be at the door. But is there a rule that makes the door a win? Currently, the active rules don't specify that. 

The active rules are ""baba is you,"" and the other rules are about walls and stop. So touching the door wouldn't do anything unless there's a ""door is win"" rule. Since there isn't one, touching the door doesn't help. 

So, back to the original problem: how to reach the ""win"" object. The main obstacle is the walls blocking the upward path. If I can remove the stop property from those walls, I can push them out of the way. 

To remove the stop property, I need to move the ""stop"" rule. The ""stop"" rule is at 4 step up. Let's see if I can reach it. 

From my current position (1 left, 1 down), moving up four times would get me to 4 step up, but there are walls at 3 steps right and 4 step up. Those walls are stoppable, so I can't move past them.

Let's try to figure out what the correct action is here. The current active rule is ""baba is you,"" meaning I can move Baba. The goal is usually to reach the ""win"" object, but I need to check if that's still the case.

Looking at the objects on the map, the ""win"" rule is positioned 9 steps to the right and 5 steps up. There's also a ""door"" at 7 steps to the right and 1 step down. But right now, the active rules don't have anything changing the win condition, so the default is still to reach the ""win"" object.

Now, where is Baba located? From the observation, there's a ""rule `baba`"" at 1 step to the left and 1 step down. So, that must be where Baba is standing. To move towards the ""win"" object, which is up and to the right, I need to figure out the direction.

The walls are blocking some paths. Let me map out the positions:

- There are walls starting from 3 steps to the right (at various heights) going up to 5 steps up. Then, further right, there are more walls at 4 steps to the right and upwards. The ""is"" rules and other objects are spread out.

Baba is at 1 step left and 1 step down. To get to the ""win"" at 9 right, 5 up, I need to move right and up. But there are walls blocking the straight path. Maybe I need to find a way around by moving through the available spaces.

Looking at the nearby objects, there's a ""key"" at 2 steps right and 4 steps up. Maybe picking up the key opens a door, but the door is already present. However, the door is a ""stop"" object unless its rule is changed. The current rules don't mention the door being passable, so it's blocking the path.

Since I can move Baba (because ""baba is you""), I need to see if I can manipulate any text blocks to change rules. The ""is"" rules are scattered around. For example, there's an ""is"" at 7 steps right, 5 up, which is part of the ""win"" rule. If I can move that ""is"" somewhere else, maybe I can create a new rule.

But to do that, I need to move the ""is"" text block. The problem is that some objects are marked as ""stop,"" which means they can't be moved. Let's check the immovable objects. The ""stop"" rule is at 1 step left and 4 step up, and walls are generally stoppable. So, maybe the ""is"" blocks can be moved if they're not on a stop.

Baba is at 1 left, 1 down. To reach the ""is"" at 7 right, 5 up, that's a long way with walls in between. Alternatively, there's an ""is"" at 3 steps right and 1 step up. Maybe moving that ""is"" next to ""baba"" or another object to create a new rule like ""baba is win"" or something else.

Wait, the current active rule is only ""baba is you."" So, if I can create a rule like ""baba is win,"" then Baba would become the win object, and touching it would complete the level. Alternatively, changing the ""win"" rule to be something else that Baba can interact with.

Looking at the objects, the ""door"" is at 7 right, 1 down. If I could make ""door"" be ""win,"" then reaching the door would be the goal. To do that, I need to move the ""win"" rule to the door's position. The ""win"" rule is currently at 9 right, 5 up. If I can grab that ""win"" text block and move it to the door's location, then the win condition changes.

But how to move the ""win"" rule? The player (Baba) needs to be adjacent to the text block and then move in the direction while carrying it. Since Baba is at 1 left, 1 down, moving right towards the ""is"" at 7 right, 5 up might be possible, but there are walls blocking the path. For example, walls at 3 steps right and up to 5 steps up. So, maybe a detour is needed.

Alternatively, there's a ""key"" at 2 right, 4 up. Maybe picking up the key first would help, but the key is on a ""stop"" wall? The key's position is 2 right, 4 up, and the wall at 4 right, 4 up. So, the key is on a wall? If the wall is a stop, then I can't move the key unless the wall's property is changed. But since ""wall is stop"" is a rule, maybe the key is on a stop, making it immovable. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the key is separate from the wall. The observation says ""key 1 step to the right and 4 step up"" and then walls starting at 3 steps right. So, the key is at 2 right, 4 up, next to the wall at 3 right, 4 up. So, the key is on a sand (non-stop) tile, allowing me to pick it up if possible. But in Baba Is You, you can only move objects that are not defined as stop. Since the wall is stop, but the key is a separate object, maybe it's movable.

If I can move the key, maybe it's a distraction. But the main goal is to reach the win condition. Let's think about the ""is"" rules. There's an ""is"" at 2 steps right and 1 step up. If I can move that ""is"" next to ""baba"" and ""win,"" then create ""baba is win.""

Wait, the current active rules are only ""baba is you."" So, to create a new rule, I need to have two text blocks: a subject and a property. For example, ""baba"" and ""win,"" connected by an ""is"" block.

If I can move the ""is"" block from 3 right, 1 up to be between ""baba"" (which is at 1 left, 1 down) and ""win"" (9 right, 5 up), that would create ""baba is win,"" making Baba the win object. But the distance is huge. Baba is at 1 left, 1 down. To reach the ""is"" block at 3 right, 1 up, he needs to move right twice and up once. Let's see:

From Baba's position (1 left, 1 down):

1. Move right to neutral position (0 steps right/down).
2. Move up once to reach 1 up.
3. Move right three times to reach 3 right, 1 up where the ""is"" block is.

Once he has the ""is"" block, he needs to move it to be adjacent to ""baba"" and ""win."" But ""win"" is far away. Alternatively, place the ""is"" next to ""baba"" and ""you"" to make ""baba is you"" again, which doesn't help. Alternatively, create ""baba is win"" by moving ""is"" next to ""baba"" and ""win.""

But moving the ""is"" block to near ""win"" would require going all the way to 9 right, 5 up, which is blocked by walls. So this seems difficult.

Alternative approach: Change the ""you"" rule. The ""you"" rule is at 1 step down, next to the ""is"" block. If I can make Baba the ""you,"" which he already is via ""baba is you."" But maybe there's another ""you"" somewhere else? No, the only ""you"" is at 1 step down.

Wait, the active rule is ""baba is you,"" so that's set. Maybe the goal is to reach the ""door,"" but how? The door is a ""stop"" object unless its rule is changed. There's a rule ""door"" at 6 right, 1 down. If I can make ""door"" not a stop, then I could move through it. For example, create ""door is not stop"" or ""door is pass.""

But to do that, I need to find the ""stop"" rule and either move it or create a conflicting rule. The ""stop"" rule is at 1 left, 4 up. If I can move that ""stop"" rule away, then the door's ""stop"" property might be removed. Alternatively, create a rule like ""door is pass.""

But how to do that? Let's see. The ""is"" blocks are scattered. There's an ""is"" at 7 right, 5 up (part of the ""win"" rule), another at 3 right, 1 up, etc. If I can move an ""is"" block next to ""door"" and ""pass,"" but I don't see a ""pass"" rule. Alternatively, create ""door is not stop"" by moving the ""stop"" rule away.

This is getting complicated. Maybe the simplest way is to push the ""win"" rule to the door's location. The ""win"" rule is at 9 right, 5 up. The door is at 7 right, 1 down. To move the ""win"" rule, I need to be adjacent to it and move in the direction while carrying it. But the path is blocked by walls. From the current position, Baba is at 1 left, 1 down. To reach the ""win"" rule at 9 right, 5 up, he needs to move right 10 times and up 4 times, but there are walls at 3 right and up to 5. So that's not feasible.

Alternative idea: Use the key. If the key is movable, maybe pick it up and use it to unlock something. But the key is at 2 right, 4 up, and the door is at 7 right, 1 down. Not sure how the key would help here.

Wait, another possibility: The ""rule `baba`"" is at 1 step to the left and 1 step down. If I can move this ""baba"" text block to a different position, maybe combine it with other rules. For example, if I move ""baba"" next to ""win"" and an ""is"" block, creating ""baba is win.""

But to do that, I need to move the ""baba"" label. The ""baba"" rule is a text block that can be moved, right? Since it's not defined as stop (unless there's a rule saying ""baba is stop,"" which there isn't), so it should be movable.

So, the plan could be:

1. Move towards the ""baba"" text block at 1 left, 1 down (Baba's current position).
2. Pick up the ""baba"" text block and move it to a desired location.
3. Find an ""is"" block and a ""win"" block to create ""baba is win.""

But this seems complicated. Let's think step by step.

Current position of Baba: rule `baba` is at 1 left, 1 down. So that's where Baba is.

First, move right to get closer to other objects. For example, move right to reach the ""is"" block at 1 step down. Wait, the ""is"" block is at 1 step down, next to ""you."" So from Baba's position (1 left, 1 down), moving right once would place him at neutral (0 right, 1 down). Then moving down to reach the ""is"" block at 1 step down. But wait, the ""is"" block is at 1 step down, same as Baba's current position? No, the ""is"" block is at 1 step down from where?

Looking at the observation:

rule `baba` 2 step to the left and 1 step down

rule `is` 1 step to the left and 1 step down

rule `you` 1 step down

So, all these are positioned relative to the player's starting point? Or are the positions absolute?

This is a bit confusing. Let me parse the observation again.

The observation lists objects with their positions relative to the player, I think. For example, ""wall 3 steps to the right and 5 step up"" means there's a wall 3 steps to the right and 5 steps up from the player's current position.

Similarly, ""rule `baba` 2 step to the left and 1 step down"" means the ""baba"" text block is 2 steps to the left and 1 step down from the player.

So, the player (Baba) is at position (0,0). The objects are positioned relative to that.

So, the ""baba"" text block is at (-2, -1). The ""is"" text block is at (-1, -1). The ""you"" text block is at (0, -1). Then there are walls further out.

The ""win"" rule is at (8,5), ""is"" at (7,5), etc.

So, the player's current position is (0,0). To get to the ""win"" at (8,5), need to move right 8 and up 5, but there are walls at (3,5), (3,4), etc.

Alternative route: Move around the walls. For example, go right to (3,0), but there's a wall at (3,0). Wait, looking at the objects:

wall 3 steps to the right and 5 step up → (3,5)

wall 3 steps to the right and 4 step up → (3,4)

... and down to (3,1). So, a vertical wall from (3,1) to (3,5).

Similarly, another wall at (4,5) upwards.

The ""is"" block at (3,1) is part of a horizontal rule? Maybe.

The key is at (2,4). So, if I can move right to (2,4) to get the key, but there's a wall at (3,4), so maybe the key is at (2,4), adjacent to the wall. But can I move the key? Since the wall is a stop, but the key is a separate object, maybe it's movable.

Assuming the key is movable, picking it up could help, but I'm not sure how.

Another approach: Since the player is ""baba is you,"" maybe the goal is to reach the ""win"" object by moving it. But ""win"" is a rule, not an object. Wait, no, the ""win"" rule defines that touching the corresponding object (door?) is a win. So, in this level, the win condition is probably touching the door, which is a ""door"" object. But the door is a ""stop"" unless its rule is changed.

The door is at (6,1). There's a rule `door` at (6,1). So, the door's property is defined by that rule. Since there's no rule like ""door is pass"" or ""door is not stop,"" the door is stoppable.

So, to pass through the door, need to change its rule. For example, create ""door is pass"" or ""door is you"" (but you are already you).

Alternatively, make the door the win object. If I can change the ""win"" rule to point to the door's position, then touching the door would be the win condition.

The ""win"" rule is at (8,5). To move it to (6,1), I would need to carry that text block. From (0,0), moving to (8,5) is blocked by walls. So that's not feasible.

Alternative idea: Use the ""is"" blocks to create a new rule. For example, if I can create ""baba is door,"" then touching the door would make Baba the door, but that doesn't help. Or ""baba is win,"" making Baba the win object.

To create ""baba is win,"" I need to have the ""baba"" text block next to the ""win"" text block and an ""is"" block.

The ""baba"" text block is at (-2,-1). The ""win"" text block is at (8,5). The ""is"" blocks are at (7,5), (3,1), etc.

So, it's a long distance. Perhaps there's a closer ""is"" block that can be moved.

The ""is"" block at (3,1) is near the lower part of the map. If I can move that ""is"" block to be between ""baba"" and ""win,"" but the distance is too great.

Alternatively, move the ""is"" block at (1,-1) (adjacent to ""you"") to be next to ""baba"" and ""win."" But again, the distance is an issue.

Maybe a better approach is to make the door passable. To do that, I need to create a rule like ""door is not stop."" The existing ""stop"" rule is at (-1,4). If I can move that ""stop"" rule away, then the door's stop property might be removed.

So, steps:

1. Move to the ""stop"" rule at (-1,4).
2. Pick it up and move it somewhere else, like down to (-1,5), so it's no longer affecting the door.

But how to reach (-1,4)? From (0,0), moving left 1 and up 4. There are walls at (3,5) upwards, but (-1,4) is to the left and up. Let's see:

From (0,0), move left once to (-1,0). Then up four times to (-1,4). But along the way, are there any walls?

Looking at the objects:

At (2 step to the left and 4 step up): rule `wall` at (-2,4).

So, moving left from (0,0) to (-1,0) is possible. Then up to (-1,1), (-1,2), (-1,3), (-1,4). At (-1,4), there's a ""stop"" rule. So, can reach there.

Once there, pick up the ""stop"" rule and move it down to, say, (-1,5). Then, the door at (6,1) would no longer be a stop, allowing passage.

After moving the ""stop"" rule, the door's property is removed, so I can move through it. Then, go to the door and win.

So the action plan would be:

1. Move left once to (-1,0).
2. Move up four times to reach (-1,4), where the ""stop"" rule is.
3. Move the ""stop"" rule down to (-1,5).
4. Now, the door at (6,1) is no longer stop, so move right and down to reach it.
5. Touch the door to win.

But let's verify the movements step by step.

Let's try to figure out what to do here. So the current game state has me as Baba, and the rule ""Baba is you"" is active. The goal is usually to reach the WIN object, but maybe that's changed somehow. Let me check the active rules again.

Looking at the objects, there's a door 1 step to the left. Also, there's a key in the map. But I'm not sure if I need to pick up the key first. Wait, the rules mention ""win"" is a rule at the top right, but it's probably a wall or something else. The door might be the win condition, but it's blocked by walls or stop rules. 

The key is at 2 steps to the right and 4 steps up. Maybe I need to get there, but there are walls in the way. The path is blocked by walls. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe I can manipulate the rules to change what's a stop or make the walls movable. 

The rules on the ground: there's a rule `is` at 8 steps right and 5 up, which is part of the original rules. Also, `wall` is defined as a stop. If I can move the `is` text block, maybe I can create a new rule like ""baba is win"" or ""win is you"". That way, touching the win object would make me win. 

Baba is currently at 1 step to the left and 1 step down. Wait, looking at the objects, ""rule `baba`"" is at 1 step to the left and 1 step down. So maybe that's where I am? Or is that a separate object? Let me check the positions again. The door is 1 step to the left from Baba's position, perhaps? 

If I can move the `baba` text block to say ""baba is door"" or something, but I need to be able to move objects. The rules say that only objects not defined as STOP can be moved. The `is` rule is movable, the `key` is movable if it's not stopped. Looking at the rules, `stop` is at 1 step left and 4 up, so maybe some objects are stopped. 

So, to move the `is` text block, I need to be adjacent to it and move towards it. The `is` block is at 8 steps right and 5 up. But where am I currently? The `baba` rule is at 1 step left and 1 step down. So my position is 1 step left and 1 step down. The `is` block is way to the right and up. Maybe I need to navigate there first. 

But the path is blocked by walls. The walls are in a straight line to the right and up. Maybe I need to break the wall rules. If I can create a rule that says ""wall is not stop"", then I could move through walls. But how? To do that, I need to move an `is` block to change the wall's property. 

Alternatively, if I can get to the `is` block at 8 steps right and 5 up, I could rearrange the rules. For example, move `is` to create ""baba is win"" or ""win is you"". Since I'm Baba and ""Baba is you"", if I make ""win is you"", then touching the win object (which is a rule at 9 steps right and 5 up) would make me win. 

But to do that, I need to move the `is` block. Let's see the positions again. My current position is near the `baba` rule at 1 left, 1 down. The `is` blocks are up high. Maybe I can move down to the lower `is` blocks first. There's an `is` at 3 steps right and 1 step up. That's closer. If I can get there, maybe I can rearrange the rules. 

Wait, the active rules are just ""baba is you"". The other rules are on the map as objects. So to create new rules, I need to take an `is` block and combine it with a subject and property. For example, move an `is` next to ""Baba"" and ""win"" to make ""Baba IS win"". 

But how to get the `is` blocks? The closest `is` is at 3 steps right and 1 step up. If I can move down to that area. Let me check the movement. From my current position (1 left, 1 down), moving down would take me to 1 left, 2 down. But are there walls there? There's a wall at 4 steps right, 1 step down. So maybe moving left or right. 

Alternatively, move left to the `baba` rule, then move up. But I need to navigate carefully. The key is at 2 right, 4 up. Maybe getting the key isn't necessary right now. 

Another approach: Since I'm Baba and ""Baba is you"", if I can make ""door is win"", then touching the door would make it a win. The door is 1 step left. So if I can create the rule ""door is win"", then moving to the door would win the level. 

To do that, I need to take an `is` block and place it next to ""door"" and ""win"". The `win` rule is at 9 right, 5 up, which is far away. The door is at 1 left. So maybe there's a closer `is` block. The `is` at 8 right, 5 up is too far. The `is` at 3 right, 1 up is closer. 

So the plan is: move to the `is` block at 3 right, 1 up, then move it to the door (1 left) and combine with ""win"" (9 right, 5 up). But that's a long distance. Alternatively, use the `is` block at 7 right, 1 up (rule `key` is there). Hmm. 

Alternatively, move the `is` block at 8 right, 5 up down to the door area. But how? Maybe move down step by step. 

Wait, the current position of the `is` block at 8 right, 5 up is high up. To get there, I need to move right and up from my current position. But there are walls in the way. For example, walls at 4 right, 5 up, 4 right, 4 up, etc. So blocking the path. 

Maybe I need to delete some wall rules. If I can make ""wall is not stop"", then I can move through walls. To do that, I need to create a rule ""wall is not stop"". To do that, I need to take an `is` block, and place it next to ""wall"" and ""not stop"". But ""not stop"" isn't an existing rule. Unless I can create a negation. 

Wait, in Baba Is You, you can create rules like ""flag is not stop"" by placing ""flag is"" next to ""not stop"". But ""not stop"" would need to be a separate text block. However, in the current map, I don't see a ""not"" rule. So that might not be possible. 

Alternatively, if I can make ""stop is nothing"", but again, ""nothing"" isn't on the map. 

Hmm. This is tricky. Maybe the key is to realize that the door is the win condition, and I need to get to it. But it's blocked by walls. So perhaps I need to remove the stop property from the walls. 

To remove ""stop"" from walls, I can create a rule like ""wall is not stop"". To do that, I need an `is` block, a ""wall"" block, and a ""not stop"" block. But ""not stop"" isn't present. Unless I can rearrange existing rules. 

Wait, the existing rules include ""stop"" at 1 left, 4 up. If I can move that ""stop"" rule somewhere else, but it's a stop itself, so I can't move it unless it's not a stop. But it's defined as a stop, so I can't pick it up. 

This is getting complicated. Maybe there's a simpler way. Let's look at the current active rules: only ""baba is you"". All other rules are on the map as objects. So to create new rules, I need to combine subjects and properties with an `is` block. 

The door is at 1 left. If I can make ""door is you"", then since I'm you (because Baba is you), touching the door would make me win. So how to create ""door is you"". 

The `you` rule is at 1 step down. So if I can move an `is` block next to ""door"" and ""you"", that would create ""door is you"". 

So the steps would be: 
1. Move to the `is` block at 3 steps right and 1 step up. 
2. Move that `is` block to the door's position (1 left). 
3. Place it next to ""door"" and ""you"" (which is at 1 step down). 

But how to navigate there? Let's think about movement. 

Current position: rule `baba` is at 1 step left and 1 step down. So maybe my position is there. To get to the `is` block at 3 right, 1 up, I need to move right three times and up once. But the path is blocked by walls. Let's see: 

From current position (1 left, 1 down):
- Moving right once: would that hit a wall? There's a wall at 3 steps right, 5 up, but that's way up. Wait, the walls are in a vertical line to the right starting from 3 steps right. So at 3 right, 5 up is a wall, 4 right, 5 up is a wall, etc. But closer to me, at 3 right, 4 up is a wall. So moving right from my current position (assuming I'm at 0,0 or some coordinate), maybe the walls are to the right and up. 

This is a bit confusing without a visual. Let's try to map it out mentally. 

Key objects:
- Door at 1 step left.
- Key at 2 right, 4 up.
- Multiple walls to the right and up.
- `is` blocks at high up positions and one at 3 right, 1 up.
- `you` rule at 1 step down.

If I can get to the `is` block at 3 right, 1 up, then move it to the door's area. Let's see:

From current position (1 left, 1 down):
- Move right to 0,1 down.
- Then right again to 1,1 down.
- Then right to 2,1 down.
- Then right to 3,1 down. But there's a wall at 3 right, 1 step up. Wait, the wall at 3 right, 1 step up is different. At 3 right, 1 down is maybe passable? Or is there a wall there?

Looking at the objects listed:
- rule `is` 2 steps to the right and 1 step up.
- wall 3 steps to the right and 1 step up.

So at 3 right, 1 up is a wall. But at 3 right, 1 down, is there a wall? The objects listed don't mention that. So maybe it's passable. 

So moving right three times from current position (1 left, 1 down) to get to 3 right, 1 down. Then move up one step to 3 right, 2 down. Then up to 3 right, 3 down. But there's a wall at 3 right, 3 step up? Wait, no, the walls are at 3 right, 5 up; 4 right, 5 up; etc. Maybe the lower walls are not there. 

This is getting too confusing. Maybe I should try moving down towards the `you` rule. The `you` rule is at 1 step down. If I can get there and combine with an `is` block, maybe I can make myself you again, but I already am. 

Alternatively, move the `is` block at 1 step down (next to `you`) to create a new rule. For example, `baba is door`. 

The `baba` rule is at 2 step left and 1 step down. So if I can move the `is` block at 1 step down (which is next to `you`) to be next to `baba` and `door`, that would make ""baba is door"". Then, since I'm Baba and ""Baba is you"", touching the door would make me win. 

So the steps would be:
1. Move to the `is` block at 1 step down (adjacent to `you`).
2. Move that `is` block to the `baba` rule (2 left, 1 down) and the `door` (1 left).
3. Combine them to create ""baba is door"".

But how to move the `is` block. The `is` is at 1 step down. My current position is at the `baba` rule, which is 2 left and 1 down. So to get to the `is` block at 1 step down, I need to move down once from my current position. 

Wait, my current position is where the `baba` rule is, which is 2 step left and 1 step down. So if I move down from there, I would be at 2 left, 2 down. Is that passable? There's a wall at 3 right, 1 step up, but not sure about that area. 

Alternatively, move left to get to the `is` block. From 2 left, 1 down, moving left once to 1 left, 1 down, which is where the door is. But the door is a separate object. 

This is really confusing without seeing the actual level layout. Maybe I need to make a guess. 

Given that the previous actions kept getting failed because of invalid commands, maybe the correct action here is to move towards the `is` block that's near the `you` rule and then rearrange it to create a new rule. 

Alternatively, since the door is 1 step left, and I'm at 2 left, 1 down, moving left once would get me to 1 left, 1 down, which is next to the door. If I can create a rule ""door is win"" there, but I don't have an `is` block adjacent. 

Wait, there's an `is` block at 1 step down, which is next to the `you` rule. So if I move down to that `is` block, then move it to the door's position and combine with `win`, but the `win` is far away. 

Alternatively, use the `is` block at 8 right, 5 up. But that's too far. 

Maybe the intended solution is to move the `is` block next to `baba` and `win` to make ""baba is win"". But how to get there. 

Given the time I've spent and the previous failures, perhaps the correct action now is to move left towards the door. Even though there's a wall, maybe the wall can be moved if the rule is changed. 

But without changing the wall's rule, I can't pass. So maybe the answer is to move left despite the wall, but that's not possible. 

Alternatively, pick up the `key` and use it to unlock something, but there's no lock mentioned. 

Wait, the door might be a stop, so I can't pass through it. But if I can make the door not a stop, then I can go through. To do that, create a rule like ""door is not stop"". But to do that, I need an `is` block next to door and not stop. 

But ""not stop"" isn't on the map. Unless I can make a new rule with negation. 

In Baba Is You, you can create negations by placing ""is"" next to ""not"" and another property. For example, ""flag is not stop"" would require ""not"" somewhere. But in this level, there's no ""not"" text block. 

So maybe that's not possible. 

Another angle: The WIN rule is at 9 steps right and 5 up. If I can make ""baba is win"", then touching the win object would make me win. To do that, move an `is` block next to `baba` and `win`. 

The `baba` rule is at 2 left, 1 down. The `win` rule is at 9 right, 5 up. The closest `is` block is at 8 right, 5 up. So I need to move that `is` block down to the `baba` area. 

But the path is blocked by walls. From 8 right, 5 up to 2 left, 1 down is a long way. Maybe move the `is` block down step by step. 

But each move would require avoiding walls. This seems complex, but perhaps possible. 

Alternatively, use the `is` block at 3 right, 1 up. Move it to the `baba` area. 

From 3 right, 1 up, move left to 2 right, 1 up. Is there a wall there? The objects list a wall at 4 right, 4 up, but not at 2 right, 1 up. So maybe possible. 

Then move down to 2 right, 2 up, then left to 1 right, 2 up, etc., towards the `baba` position. 

But this requires multiple precise moves. 

Given the time I've spent and the fact that previous actions failed, maybe the simplest valid action is to move left towards the door, even if it's blocked, but the system might accept a valid direction. 

So the final action is to move left.

Let's see. The current active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I can move Baba around. The goal is usually to reach the 'win' object, which is probably the door or something similar. Looking at the map, the 'win' rule is positioned far to the right at 10 steps right and 5 up. There are walls blocking the straight path.

I need to check the objects around. There's a key at 3 steps right and 4 up. Maybe I need to get the key first? But how? The key is behind some walls. Wait, the rules mention 'stop' walls, which are immovable. So I can't push them. But maybe I can rearrange the rules by moving the 'is' text block to create a new rule. 

Looking at the 'is' text blocks, there's one at 9 steps right and 5 up (part of the original 'win' rule?), another at 4 steps right and 1 up, and others. If I can move an 'is' to link 'baba' to another property, like 'key' or 'win', that might help. For example, making 'baba is key' so I can turn into the key and avoid walls. Or 'baba is win' to make myself the win condition.

But how to move the 'is' blocks? The rules say I can only move objects that aren't 'stop' or similar. The 'is' text blocks aren't labeled as stop, so they can be moved. Let me see where Baba is located. The 'baba' object is at 1 step down, probably near the bottom. If I move down to the 'baba' tile, then move left or right to grab an 'is' block.

Wait, in the current observation, the 'baba' object is at 1 step down. So if I move down to get to Baba's position, then perhaps move left to the 'is' at 1 step down. But I need to check the movement steps. Let me map this out.

Baba is at 1 step down. To reach the 'is' block at 1 step down (same position?), maybe I need to move there. But how? The active rule is 'baba is you,' so I can move freely unless blocked by 'stop' walls. The walls are to the right, so maybe I can move left towards the 'is' block.

Wait, the 'is' block at 1 step down is right next to the 'you' rule. So if I can get to that 'is' block, I can maybe rearrange the rules. For example, move 'baba is you' to make 'baba is win' or something. But I need to pick up the 'is' text block and place it with another rule.

Alternatively, maybe I should move the 'key' first. If I become the key, I could pass through stop walls. But to do that, I need to create a rule like 'baba is key'. To do that, I need to move an 'is' block next to 'baba' and 'key'.

Looking at the current setup, the 'key' is at 3 steps right and 4 up. The 'is' block is at 4 steps right and 1 up, which is lower. Maybe I can move down to the 'baba' position, then move left to the 'is' at 1 step down, pick it up, and then move up to the key's location.

But the path might be blocked. There are walls to the right, but if I go left from Baba's position, maybe there's a path. Alternatively, move down to the 'baba' tile, then left to the 'is' block at 1 step down, then move up to the key's area.

Alternatively, the 'door' is at 8 steps right and 1 step down. If I can make 'baba' the door or 'win', that might work. But the 'win' rule is far up. Maybe a better approach is to create 'baba is door' or 'baba is win' by rearranging the rules.

Another angle: the 'stop' walls are at 4 step up and 1 step right and 4 step up. So those are immovable. The key is behind a wall at 5 steps right and 4 up. But if I can become the key, I could move through walls. So 'baba is key' would let me go through stop walls. Then I could grab the key and use it to open the door or reach the win condition.

To make 'baba is key', I need to move the 'is' block next to 'baba' and 'key'. The 'key' is at 3 right, 4 up. The 'is' block is at 4 right, 1 up. So maybe move down to the 'baba' position, left to the 'is' at 1 step down, then move up to the key's area. But the path might be blocked by walls.

Alternatively, move the 'is' block from 4 right, 1 up to be between 'baba' and 'key'. But how? Let's see. If I can get the 'is' block to the key's location, then combine them. But the key is at 3 right, 4 up. The 'is' is at 4 right, 1 up. So moving the 'is' block up and left. But movement is step by step.

Alternatively, maybe the best move is to move towards the 'is' block at 1 step down, pick it up, and then move to the key's location to create 'baba is key'. That way, I can then move through walls to reach the door or win.

So step-by-step: move down to reach Baba, then left to the 'is' block, take it, then move up to the key, place the 'is' next to key, making 'baba is key'. Then, with the key, move through walls to the door or win.

But in the current observation, the 'baba' is at 1 step down. So first action could be 'down' to get to Baba's position. Then 'left' to reach the 'is' block at 1 step down. Then 'up' multiple times to get to the key's location. But need to check if the path is clear.

Wait, the key is at 3 right, 4 up. From the 'is' block at 4 right, 1 up, moving left to 3 right, then up to 4 up. But there's a wall at 5 steps right and 4 up, but that's to the right. So moving left from 4 right to 3 right would be possible if there's no wall. Let me check the objects. At 3 steps right and 4 up, there's a key and a wall. So the wall is at 5 right, 4 up. So moving from 4 right, 1 up to 3 right, 4 up would require passing through 4 right, 2 up, 3 up, etc. Are there walls in between?

Looking at the map: walls at 4 right, 4 up; 4 right, 3 up; 4 right, 2 up. So from 4 right, 1 up, moving up to 4 right, 2 up is blocked by a wall. So can't go straight up. Need to find another path.

Alternatively, move left from the 'is' block at 4 right, 1 up to 3 right, 1 up. Then up to 3 right, 2 up, but there's no wall mentioned there. Wait, the walls are at 5 right, 4 up, 4 right, 4 up, etc. So at 3 right, 2 up, is there a wall? The observation doesn't list a wall there, so maybe it's clear. So the path could be: from 'is' at 4 right, 1 up → left to 3 right, 1 up → up to 3 right, 2 up → up to 3 right, 3 up → up to 3 right, 4 up (where the key is).

But need to confirm if those steps are possible. The active rule is 'baba is you', so movement is possible unless blocked by 'stop' walls. The 'stop' walls are at 1 left and 4 up, and others. So moving left and up should be okay as long as no 'stop' walls are in the way.

Once the 'is' block is moved to the key's location, creating 'baba is key', then I can move as the key, passing through 'stop' walls. Then head towards the door or win condition.

But the current step is to choose the next action. Given the current position of Baba (1 step down), perhaps the first move is to 'down' to get to Baba's tile, then 'left' to reach the 'is' block. Alternatively, if I'm already on Baba's tile, maybe move left directly.

Wait, the observation says ""rule `baba` 2 step to the left and 1 step down"" in earlier steps, but in the latest observation, the 'baba' object is at ""rule `baba` 1 step down"". So assuming that the player is on the 'baba' tile at 1 step down. So the next move could be to move left towards the 'is' block at 1 step down.

So the action would be 'left' to reach the 'is' block. Once there, pick up the 'is' block and move it to the key's location. But in the current step, the agent needs to choose the next action. So the immediate action is to move left to get to the 'is' block.

Let's try to figure out the solution here. So far, the user has been moving in various directions like down, left, right, and sometimes idling. The active rule is still ""baba is you,"" which means whatever Baba is doing, those actions apply to him.

Looking at the current observation, the map has several walls, rules, a key, and a door. The goal is usually to reach the door or whatever is defined as ""win,"" but the rules might have changed. Let me check the objects again.

The key is at 3 steps to the right and 4 steps up. But to get there, there might be walls blocking the path. The door is at 1 step to the right, but there's a wall 5 steps to the right. Also, there's a rule ""door 8 steps to the right and 1 step down,"" which might be another door. 

Wait, the active rules are still ""baba is you,"" so Baba can move around unless blocked by STOP properties. Let me see the STOP rules. There's a ""rule `stop` 4 step up"" which might mean that the object at 4 steps up is a STOP. But I need to check where exactly the STOP is located. 

Looking at the objects, the ""stop"" rule is at 4 steps up, but the actual objects at that position are walls. So perhaps the walls are STOP objects because of the ""rule wall is stop"" or something similar. Wait, the current active rules only have ""baba is you."" So maybe the walls are STOP because they have the ""stop"" property defined elsewhere. 

In previous observations, there were rules like ""wall is stop"" which would make the walls immovable. But in the current active rules, it's just ""baba is you."" So maybe the walls are still stop because of previous rules that were set. But the user hasn't mentioned any active rules other than ""baba is you,"" so maybe those walls are pushable unless they have STOP. 

Wait, according to the tips, if an object is defined as STOP or similar, you can't move it. So even if the active rule is ""baba is you,"" if there's a wall with a STOP property, you can't move through it. But in the current observation, the active rules don't include any STOP properties. Wait, no—the active rules are just ""baba is you."" The other rules like ""wall is stop"" might have been changed or are not active anymore. 

Wait, the current active rules are listed as ""baba is you."" The other rules (like wall is stop) might have been removed or overridden. So perhaps the walls are no longer STOP. But looking at the objects, there are walls in various positions. For example, ""wall 5 steps to the right and 5 step up"" and others. But without a STOP rule, maybe Baba can push those walls? Or maybe not. 

In Baba Is You, the default is that you can move around unless there's a STOP. So if the active rules don't have STOP, then Baba can move through walls? Wait, no, normally walls are STOP unless their rule is changed. So if the rule ""wall is stop"" is still active, then walls are STOP. But in the current active rules, it's only ""baba is you."" So maybe the walls are not STOP anymore. 

This is getting a bit confusing. Let me recap. The goal is usually to reach the WIN object, which is a door or something else. In the current observation, there's a ""rule `win` 10 steps to the right and 5 step up,"" but that's quite far. The door is at 1 step to the right, but there's a wall there. However, if the walls are not STOP, maybe Baba can move through them. But in previous steps, the user was trying to move left, right, down, etc., but failing, perhaps because the walls were STOP. 

Wait, looking at the objects, there's a ""rule `door` 8 steps to the right and 1 step down."" Maybe that's the win condition. So to reach there, Baba needs to navigate through the map. 

The key is at 3 steps right and 4 up. If Baba can get the key, maybe that unlocks something. But how? The key is on a rule `key` object. To pick up the key, in Baba Is You, you might need to touch it while being the YOU object. But since Baba is YOU, touching the key would make him KEY, and then maybe he can use the key to open a door. 

But the current active rule is ""baba is you,"" so touching the key would create a new rule ""baba is key."" Then, if there's a door that requires a key, Baba could push it. But in the current setup, the door is at 1 step right, which is blocked by a wall. The other door is at 8 steps right and 1 step down, which might be the WIN door. 

So the plan could be: move towards the key to pick it up, then use it to open the WIN door. But to get to the key, need to navigate past the walls. Let's see the positions. 

Baba's position isn't explicitly stated, but the ""rule `baba` 1 step down"" indicates that there's a Baba text block at 1 step down. So Baba's current position is probably at that location. 

So from Baba's position (1 step down), the key is at 3 right, 4 up. The path might be blocked by walls. Let's check the walls. There's a wall at 5 steps right and 5 up, but that's above. The walls at 4 steps right and 1 step up, etc., might be below. 

Alternatively, maybe moving left from Baba's position (1 step down) could lead towards the key. But the key is to the right. Hmm. 

Alternatively, perhaps the solution is to rearrange the rules. For example, make ""door is win"" so that reaching the door becomes the goal. Or make ""baba is key"" to pick up the key. 

But to move the text blocks, you have to be able to push them, which requires that the objects they're on are not STOP. Since the current active rule is ""baba is you,"" and there's no STOP rule, maybe the text blocks can be moved. 

Looking at the objects, there's a ""rule `is` 9 steps to the right and 5 step up."" That's the ""is"" text block that's part of the ""win"" rule. To create a new rule, Baba needs to touch a subject and a property. For example, touching ""baba"" and ""win"" to make ""baba is win."" 

But how to reach those text blocks? They're quite far to the right and up. Maybe the user needs to move right and up, but the path is blocked by walls. 

Alternatively, maybe the solution is to make ""you"" a different object, like the key, so that touching the key makes Baba the key, which can then open the door. 

Wait, if the rule is ""you is key,"" then touching the key would make Baba key. But currently, the active rule is ""baba is you,"" so to create ""you is key,"" Baba would need to touch the ""you"" text block and the ""key"" text block. 

The ""you"" text block is at 1 step to the right and 1 step down. The ""key"" text block is at 9 steps right and 1 step up. So the distance is significant. 

Alternatively, maybe the user can move the ""is"" text block to create a new rule. For example, moving ""is"" next to ""baba"" and ""win"" to make ""baba is win."" That way, Baba becomes the win condition, and he can touch himself to win. 

But to do that, Baba needs to be near those text blocks. The ""win"" rule is at 10 steps right and 5 up, which is far. 

Alternatively, maybe the current door at 8 steps right and 1 step down is the win condition. If the rule is ""door is win,"" then reaching the door would win. But the active rule is ""win is door"" or similar? No, the active rule is just ""baba is you,"" and there's a ""rule `win` ..."" which is part of the level's initial setup, but not an active rule. 

Wait, in Baba Is You, the active rules are the ones that are currently on the screen as text blocks. So the ""rule `win` 10 steps to the right..."" is a static object, not an active rule. The only active rule is ""baba is you."" So the win condition is still whatever it was initially, probably the door. 

But how to reach the door? The door is at 1 step right, but there's a wall there. Unless the wall is not a STOP. If the wall's rule is no longer ""wall is stop,"" then Baba can push it. 

But how to remove the ""wall is stop"" rule? That would require destroying the existing rule or moving it away. 

Looking at the objects, there's a ""rule `wall` 2 step to the left and 4 step up"" and ""rule `stop` 1 step to the left and 4 step up."" These might be part of the initial setup, but they're static objects, not active rules. The active rules only include ""baba is you."" 

So perhaps the walls are not STOP anymore, meaning Baba can move through them. If that's the case, then moving right from Baba's position (1 step down) could be possible. 

Baba's position is at the rule `baba` which is 1 step down. So maybe he's at (0,0), and the rule `baba` is at (0, -1). To move right, he'd go to (1, -1), but is there a wall there? There's a wall at 5 steps to the right, which is far. 

Alternatively, moving up from the current position. The key is at 3 right, 4 up. So maybe moving up 4 steps and right 3 steps. But the path might be blocked. 

Alternatively, use the key to open a door. To do that, need to pick up the key by touching it, which would create a ""baba is key"" rule. Then, if there's a door that requires a key, like ""door needs key,"" but I don't see such a rule here. 

The door is just a door; to open it, maybe you need to push it, but if you're the key, does that help? Not sure. 

Another approach: make the door a win condition. If there's a rule ""door is win,"" then reaching the door would win. To do that, move the ""is"" text block next to ""door"" and ""win."" The ""win"" rule is at 10 steps right and 5 up, and the ""door"" rule is at 8 steps right and 1 step down. The ""is"" rule is at various positions, like 9 steps right and 5 up, 3 steps right and 1 step up, etc. 

So maybe move the ""is"" block from 9 right,5 up to be next to door (8 right,1 down) and win (10 right,5 up). But that's quite a distance. 

Alternatively, create a rule ""baba is win"" by moving ""is"" next to ""baba"" and ""win."" The ""baba"" rule is at 1 step down, and ""win"" is at 10 right,5 up. That would require moving a lot, but maybe possible. 

Alternatively, since the user has been moving left, right, down, perhaps they need to position themselves near the key or the door. 

Given the previous actions, the user tried moving down, left, right, etc., but failed. Maybe the correct action now is to move left towards the ""you"" rule, then move the ""is"" block to create a new rule. 

For example, if Baba moves to the ""you"" rule (1 step right and 1 step down) and the ""key"" rule (9 steps right and 1 step up), he could move the ""is"" block to make ""you is key"" or ""key is you."" But that's a long distance. 

Alternatively, since the user is at the ""baba"" rule (1 step down), moving up to the ""is"" block at 3 steps right and 1 step up, then moving that ""is"" block next to ""baba"" and ""win"" to create ""baba is win."" 

But how to do that in movements? Each action is a single step. So maybe the sequence is: move up to reach the ""is"" block, then carry it to the ""baba"" and ""win"" positions. 

In the current observation, the ""is"" block is at 3 steps right and 1 step up. So from Baba's position (1 step down), moving up once gets to the same level as the ""is"" block. Then move right 3 steps and up 0 to reach the ""is"" block. But there's a wall at 5 steps right, but the ""is"" block is at 3 right,1 up. 

Once the ""is"" block is grabbed, move it to the ""baba"" (which is at 1 step down, so same x, y-1) and the ""win"" at 10 right,5 up. But that's a huge distance. 

Alternatively, create a rule ""door is win"" by moving the ""is"" block next to door and win. The door is at 8 right,1 down, and win is at 10 right,5 up. The ""is"" block is at 9 right,5 up. So move the ""is"" block left to 8 right,5 up, then down to 8 right,1 down, making ""door is win."" Then touching the door would win. 

But again, the distance is too much with single steps. 

Maybe the key is needed here. If Baba picks up the key (by moving to it and creating ""baba is key""), then maybe he can push the door. But doors in Baba Is You are usually pushed if they're not STOP. 

Alternatively, the solution is simpler. Since the active rule is ""baba is you,"" perhaps the goal is to reach the door, which is a WIN object. If the door is the WIN, then touching it would win. But the door is at 1 step right, blocked by a wall. Unless the wall is NOT a STOP. 

Looking at the objects, the wall at 5 steps right might be a STOP, but if the rule ""wall is stop"" is no longer active, then it's not. Since the only active rule is ""baba is you,"" maybe the walls are not STOP. So Baba can move through them. 

If that's the case, then moving right past the walls towards the door at 1 step right. But the door is at 1 step right from where? If Baba is at 1 step down, moving right once would reach the door's position (1 step right), but there's a wall at 5 steps right. Wait, no—the wall positions are varying. 

Wait, the objects listed are distances from Baba's position. For example, ""wall 3 steps to the right and 5 step up"" means there's a wall 3 right, 5 up from Baba. The door is ""1 step to the left,"" so left from Baba's position. 

So if Baba is at his starting position (say, center), the door is to the left. But there's a wall at 5 steps right and 5 up, etc. 

This is getting complicated. Maybe the correct action now is to move left towards the door, which is 1 step left from Baba's position. If the wall isn't a STOP, then moving left would reach the door, which is the WIN. 

Looking at the active rules, there's no rule defining door as anything other than a WIN. So if the door is the WIN, then touching it would win. 

So the action should be ""left"" to move towards the door.

I need to figure out what to do next in this Baba Is You level. I'll start by understanding the current state based on the observation provided.

First, the active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means whatever I move, Baba becomes that object. So my goal is to manipulate the rules or move objects to reach the win condition, which I believe is typically a door or a ""win"" object. Let me check the objects on the map.

Looking at the objects:

- There are several walls arranged to the right and up from Baba's position.
- There's a key located 3 steps to the right and 4 steps up. Maybe I need to get the key first?
- The ""win"" rule is at 10 steps to the right and 5 steps up. So the actual win condition might be a door or some other object labeled ""win.""
- There's a door 1 step to the right. But is that the win condition? The active rule is ""baba is you,"" so if I reach the door, since the door's rule might be ""door is stop"" or something else, I might not be able to pass through it. Wait, the rules aren't listed except for ""baba is you."" So maybe the door's behavior depends on other rules. Let me check the other rules.

The objects also include some rule blocks:

- ""rule `is`"" at various positions. The ""is"" rule is crucial because it defines how properties work. For example, if there's a ""wall is stop,"" then touching a wall would stop you.
- ""rule `win`"" is at 10 steps right and 5 up. But without ""win is [something]"" like ""win is push"" or ""win is you,"" maybe the win condition is just reaching that position if it's an object that's considered a win.

Wait, in Baba Is You, the win condition is usually an object that's defined as ""win."" So if there's a door labeled ""win,"" then reaching it would win the level. But in the current observation, the ""win"" rule is a text block at 10 steps right and 5 up. So maybe the actual win object is elsewhere, and the ""win"" rule defines its property. For example, if there's a door that has the ""win"" rule attached, then touching that door would win.

Looking at the objects again, there's a door 1 step to the right. Maybe that's the win condition. But how do I know? The active rules are only ""baba is you."" So unless there's another rule like ""door is win,"" touching the door wouldn't do anything. But in the current list of objects, I don't see a ""door is win"" rule. The ""win"" rule is a separate text block. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the win condition is reaching the ""win"" text block itself. But in Baba Is You, usually, you have to touch an object that's defined as ""win,"" not the text block. So perhaps there's another object near the ""win"" rule that's the actual win object.

Looking at the map layout:

- The ""win"" rule is at 10 steps right and 5 up. Above that, there are walls. Maybe the win object is a flag or something else placed at that position, and the ""win"" rule defines that object as winnable.

But how do I get there? The path is blocked by walls. Let's see the walls:

- Walls are at 5 steps right and 5 up, decreasing down to 2 steps up. So there's a vertical wall on the right side from up 5 to down 2. Then at 4 step up, there's a ""stop"" rule. A ""stop"" rule makes the object impassable unless you can push it or override the rule.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at 1 step right and 4 step up. So that's a text block saying ""stop"" is somewhere. If an object has ""stop"" as a property, then you can't move through it. But since I'm Baba and the rule is ""baba is you,"" I can push objects unless they're defined as ""stop."" But I need to check if any objects here are labeled ""stop.""

Looking at the objects, there's a ""rule `stop`"" at 1 step right and 4 step up. That means wherever that ""stop"" text block is placed, it defines an object as stop. For example, if there's a wall next to it, that wall would be stop. But in the objects list, there's a wall at 4 steps right and 4 step up. So maybe that wall is the one that's stop. So I can't push past it.

My current position isn't specified, but based on the objects, Baba is likely at a position where he's 2 steps left and 1 step down from the ""baba"" rule block. The ""baba"" rule is at 2 step left and 1 step down. So moving right from there would bring me closer to the other objects.

The key is at 3 steps right and 4 step up. Maybe picking up the key allows me to manipulate other rules. But how? In Baba Is You, keys can sometimes be used to unlock doors, but I need to see if there's a door that's locked. The door is 1 step to the right. If the door is locked, maybe the key opens it. But the current rules don't mention a lock, so perhaps the door is just a regular door that requires pushing or has another rule.

Alternatively, maybe the door is the win condition. If I can make the door into something I can push or pass through, then reaching it would win. Since I'm Baba and ""baba is you,"" I can push objects unless they're stop. But the door's rule isn't clear. The ""door"" rule is at 8 steps right and 1 step down. So maybe there's a text block saying ""door is stop"" somewhere, making it impassable.

Looking at the rules, the ""stop"" rule is at 1 step right and 4 step up. If that's attached to a wall, then the wall is stop. But the door's rule is separate. Unless there's a ""door is stop"" rule, which I don't see in the active rules, the door might be passable.

Wait, the active rules are only ""baba is you."" All other rules are part of the level's setup but not currently active unless moved. So the key is to move the ""is"" rule blocks to create new rules.

For example, if I can move the ""is"" block at 7 steps right and 5 up (which is part of the ""win"" rule) next to the ""win"" object, then creating ""something is win"" would make that something the win condition. But I don't see the actual win object, just the ""win"" rule.

Alternatively, maybe the door is the win object, and I need to change its rule to ""win."" If I can move the ""win"" rule next to the door, then ""door is win"" would make touching the door win the level.

So the plan could be:

1. Move towards the door (1 step right) to reach it.
2. If the door is stop, find a way to remove the stop rule or change its property.
3. Alternatively, move the ""win"" rule next to the door to make it the win condition.

But how to do that? Let's see the positions:

- The ""win"" rule is at 10 steps right and 5 up. That's quite far. There's a vertical wall from 5 steps right up to 2 steps up. So maybe the path to the ""win"" rule is blocked by walls. Unless I can push the walls aside by changing their rules.

The walls are defined by ""wall is [property]"" rules. For example, if there's a ""wall is stop"" rule, then the wall is impassable. If I can remove the ""stop"" rule from the wall or change the wall's property, I might be able to move through.

The ""stop"" rule is at 1 step right and 4 step up. If I can move that ""stop"" rule away from the wall, then the wall might no longer be stop, allowing me to push it or pass through.

But to move any rule, I need to be adjacent to it and ensure that the object I'm moving is not defined as ""stop"" or similar. Since I'm Baba and ""baba is you,"" and unless there's a ""you is stop"" rule, I can move other objects.

Looking at the current rules:

- ""baba is you"" means I can move.
- Other rules like ""wall is [property]"" are part of the level's setup. To move a rule block, I need to be adjacent to it and push it, similar to pushing other objects.

So, possible steps:

1. Move towards the ""stop"" rule at 1 step right and 4 step up. If I can move that rule away, the wall it's attached to might become passable.
2. Alternatively, move the ""is"" rule at 3 steps right and 1 step up to create new rules. For example, moving it next to the door to make ""door is win.""
3. Or, move the ""key"" to somewhere useful. The key is at 3 steps right and 4 step up. If I can get the key and use it to unlock something, but there's no lock mentioned in the rules.

Another angle: Since I'm Baba and ""you,"" I can push objects unless they're stop. The walls are likely stop unless their rule is changed. So if I can change a wall's rule from ""stop"" to something else, I might be able to push it.

For example, if there's a ""wall is stop"" rule at the position of the wall, moving the ""stop"" rule away would make the wall no longer stop, allowing me to push it out of the way.

The ""stop"" rule is at 1 step right and 4 step up. If I can move that ""stop"" rule to another location, the wall at 4 steps right and 4 step up (which is adjacent to the ""stop"" rule?) would no longer be stop, letting me push it.

But how to move the ""stop"" rule? I need to be adjacent to it and push it. My current position isn't clear, but based on the ""baba"" rule being at 2 step left and 1 step down, maybe I'm at position (0,0) assuming that's the reference. Then moving right would take me towards the other objects.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is necessary. If I pick up the key (by moving right and down to reach it), then I can use it to unlock a door. But the door is at 1 step right. If the door is locked, the key might open it. However, there's no ""lock"" rule mentioned, so maybe the door is just a regular door that requires being pushed.

Wait, in Baba Is You, doors are typically pushable if there's no ""stop"" rule on them. So if the door is not stop, I can push it. But since the active rules only have ""baba is you,"" and the door's rule is ""door is [default property]"". If the door's default property isn't stop, then I can push it.

But to reach the door, I need to navigate through the walls. The path from Baba's position to the door is likely blocked by walls. For example, from the ""baba"" rule at 2 left and 1 down, moving right 1 step would put me next to the wall at 4 steps right? Wait, the walls are at 5 steps right and varying up positions. Maybe the layout is such that there's a corridor leading to the door.

Alternatively, maybe the key is needed to access a different area. The key is at 3 steps right and 4 step up. If I can reach the key, then maybe I can use it to create a new rule. For example, moving the ""key"" next to a ""rule `is`"" block to create a new rule like ""key is push"" or something.

But the key's default property isn't clear. Unless there's a rule defining it, it might just be a regular object. But since I have the key, maybe I can use it to interact with other rules.

Another strategy: Since the goal is to reach the ""win"" rule or make an object win, perhaps I need to create a rule like ""baba is win"" or ""door is win."" To do that, I need to move the ""win"" rule text block next to the target object.

The ""win"" rule is at 10 steps right and 5 up, which is far away. There's a wall blocking that path. So moving the ""win"" rule there isn't feasible. Alternatively, maybe the actual win object is nearby, and I need to attach the ""win"" rule to it.

Looking at the objects, the door is at 1 step right. If I can move the ""win"" rule next to the door, then ""door is win"" would make touching it win the level. To do that, I need to move the ""win"" rule from 10 steps right and 5 up to near the door at 1 step right.

But the distance is too great, and there are walls in between. Unless I can push the walls aside by changing their rules. For example, if I can remove the ""stop"" property from the walls, I might be able to move them out of the way.

The ""stop"" rule is at 1 step right and 4 step up. If I move that rule to another position, say next to a wall, it would change that wall's property. For instance, if the wall at 4 steps right and 4 step up has the ""stop"" rule attached, moving the ""stop"" rule away would make that wall no longer stop, allowing me to push it.

So the steps could be:

1. Move towards the ""stop"" rule at 1 step right and 4 step up.
2. Push the ""stop"" rule to a different location, say next to a wall, removing its stop property.
3. Once the wall is no longer stop, push it out of the way to create a path.
4. Then navigate to the door and attach the ""win"" rule to it.

But how to move the ""stop"" rule? I need to be adjacent to it and push it. Let's assume my current position is next to the ""stop"" rule. If I move right, I can push the ""stop"" rule further right, say to 2 steps right and 4 step up, which might be adjacent to a wall. That would remove the stop property from that wall, allowing me to push it.

After doing that, I could move through the now-passable wall and proceed towards the door. Once near the door, I can move the ""win"" rule from its original position to the door's location, creating ""door is win.""

Alternatively, if I can reach the door first, maybe I can push the ""win"" rule onto it while being adjacent.

But considering the layout and the positions of the rules, this might be complex. Another possibility is that the key is needed to unlock a rule. For example, if there's a locked rule that requires a key to move, but in the current observation, there's no mention of a lock.

Alternatively, maybe the solution is simpler. Since I'm Baba and ""you,"" I can push objects. If the door is pushable, I can push it towards me or somewhere else. But if the door is the win condition, pushing it might not matter unless it's placed in a position where touching it occurs.

Wait, in some levels, you have to push the win object (like a flag) to a certain spot. But here, the door is already at 1 step right. If the door is the win object, then just touching it would win. But how do I know if the door is win? The active rule is ""baba is you,"" but unless there's a ""door is win"" rule, touching the door doesn't do anything.

So maybe the key is to create a ""door is win"" rule. To do that, I need to move the ""win"" rule next to the door. The ""win"" rule is at 10 steps right and 5 up, which is far from the door at 1 step right. The distance is significant, and there are walls in between. Unless I can find a way to teleport or move rules faster, this seems impossible.

Alternatively, perhaps the win condition is reaching the ""win"" rule itself. But in Baba Is You, you usually have to touch an object labeled win, not the text block. So that's unlikely.

Another angle: The ""rule `is`"" blocks can be moved to create new rules. For example, if I can move a ""is"" block next to ""baba"" and ""win,"" creating ""baba is win,"" then I would become winnable, and reaching any win object (like the door) would make me win.

But where is the ""baba"" text block? The ""rule `baba`"" is at 2 step left and 1 step down. So if I can move the ""is"" block next to that, I could create ""baba is win.""

Let me visualize the positions:

- ""rule `baba`"" is at 2 left, 1 down.
- ""rule `is`"" is at various positions, like 7 right, 5 up (part of the win rule), and 3 right, 1 up.

If I can move the ""is"" block at 3 right, 1 up to be next to the ""baba"" rule, then combining them would create ""baba is [next property]"". But the next property would need to be ""win,"" which is at 10 right, 5 up. So that's not helpful.

Alternatively, moving the ""is"" block from 7 right, 5 up (part of the win rule) to be next to ""baba"" and ""win"" might not work because they're too far apart.

This is getting complicated. Maybe the simplest solution is to move towards the door and try to interact with it. Since I'm Baba, and the rule is ""baba is you,"" I can push objects. If the door is pushable, pushing it might bring it into a position where it's the win condition. But without knowing the door's rules, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, maybe the key is needed to unlock a hidden rule. For example, if there's a ""lock is key"" rule somewhere, but I don't see that in the current objects.

Wait, the key is at 3 right, 4 up. If I can move the key to a position where it interacts with a rule, like next to a ""rule `is`"" block, maybe I can create a new rule. For example, ""key is win"" or ""key is push."" But I don't see a ""key"" rule in the active rules, so moving the key next to an ""is"" block would create a rule like ""key is [adjacent property]"". But unless the adjacent property is","

I'm stuck in Baba Is You again. Let me try to figure out what to do next. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I can move around and interact with other objects by pushing them or rearranging the rules.

First, I need to look at the objects on the map. There's a door 1 step to the right. The goal is usually to reach a ""win"" object, but I should check if the rules have changed. Right now, the active rules still have ""baba is you,"" so I can move. The ""win"" is 10 steps to the right and 5 up, which is pretty far away. There's also a key at 3 steps right and 4 up, maybe that's useful to unlock something.

Looking at the map layout:

- The walls are forming a sort of barrier on the right side. There are several walls going up from 4 steps right down to 2 steps up. Then there's a ""rule is"" block at 4 steps right and 1 step up. The door is 1 step to the right, which might be blocking the path. 

I see a ""rule door"" at 8 steps right and 1 step down. Maybe that's part of the win condition? But the active ""win"" is still the one up high. Wait, the door is 1 step to the right, so maybe that's the exit. But how do I get past it? The door is a stop unless there's a rule saying otherwise. Since the current rules don't mention the door being stop, maybe I can push it? But the door is a separate object; maybe I need to change its rule.

Wait, the ""rule door"" at 8 steps right and 1 step down might be a separate rule. So the door's position is at 1 step to the right, but there's a rule saying ""door"" is at 8 steps right and 1 down. That's confusing. Maybe the actual door object is at 1 step right, and the rule is misplaced? Or perhaps the rule ""door 7 steps to the right and 1 step down"" was moved earlier?

Alternatively, maybe the door is blocking the path to the key or the win condition. To get past the door, I might need to change its ""stop"" property or make it something else. But the current rules don't have ""door is stop,"" so maybe I can just walk through it? Wait, in Baba Is You, if there's a ""door is stop"" rule, then the door is impassable. If not, you can walk over it. Let me check the active rules again. The active rules are only ""baba is you."" So the door isn't stopped, meaning I can move through it? But then why is there a door there? Maybe it's part of the path.

Wait, the door's position is 1 step to the right. If I move right, I'd reach the door. But since there's no ""stop"" rule on door, maybe I can just walk through. But the goal is ""win,"" which is up high. Alternatively, maybe the key is necessary to unlock something else.

Looking at the objects again: there's a key at 3 steps right and 4 up. If I can get that key, maybe I can use it to unlock the door. But how? In Baba Is You, typically you need to push a key to a door that has a ""key"" rule. But right now, there's no rule specifying that a key opens a door. So unless I can create such a rule by rearranging text blocks.

The problem is that all the text blocks (rules) are either immobilized by ""stop"" or are part of the current rules. The ""rule is"" blocks are spread out. For example, there's a ""rule is"" at 8 steps right and 5 up (part of the ""win"" rule), another at 7 steps right and 5 up (""win"" again), etc. The ""rule wall"" is at 1 step left and 4 up, making that area a wall. The ""stop"" rule is at 4 step up, which might be part of a wall.

So to progress, maybe I need to rearrange the rules. For example, if I can make ""door is win,"" then reaching the door would make me win. Alternatively, make ""baba is win"" so I turn into the win object by touching it. But how to do that?

First, I need to find the text blocks that are movable. The ""rule is"" blocks are probably movable unless they're under a ""stop"" rule. Looking at the objects, the ""stop"" is at 4 step up, which is a wall. So most text blocks are movable except those under stop. 

The key is at 3 steps right and 4 up. If I can get to the key and then push it somewhere, maybe to a door. But the door is at 1 step right. If I push the key to the door, then if there's a rule like ""key is push"" or ""door is key,"" but I don't have such rules. Alternatively, create a rule ""key is win"" and place it near the key, then pick up the key and move it to the win position. But this requires manipulating the text blocks.

Alternatively, since I'm Baba and ""baba is you,"" I can push other objects. For example, the ""rule is"" blocks can be moved. If I can move a ""rule is"" block next to ""baba"" and ""win,"" I could create ""baba is win,"" making me win. But how to reach those positions?

The current position of Baba is 1 step to the left and 1 step down. So he's near the bottom left. The ""win"" rule is way up at 9 steps right and 5 up. That's a long way. Maybe I need to find a shorter path. The door at 1 step right might be on the way. If I can move right past the door, then proceed up. But the door is 1 step right from my current position. Let me check.

If I move right once, I'm at the door. Since there's no ""stop"" rule on the door, I can walk through. Then continue moving right towards the key and then up. But the walls on the right are blocking the path up. There are walls from 4 steps right down to 2 steps up. So maybe I need to rearrange the ""rule wall"" to remove those walls.

The ""rule wall"" is at 1 step left and 4 step up. If I can move that rule away, then the walls on the right might be gone. But to move that rule, I need to be adjacent to it and push it. Since I'm at 1 step left and 1 step down, maybe I can move up to the ""rule wall"" at 1 left and 4 up. Let's see:

Current position: rule `baba` is at 1 step left and 1 step down. To get to the ""rule wall"" at 1 left and 4 up, I need to move up three times. But the path is blocked by walls. There's a wall at 4 steps right and 5 up, but I'm on the left. Wait, maybe the walls on the right are separate. Let me visualize the map.

The walls on the right are from 4 steps right at 5 up down to 2 steps up. So they form a vertical line on the right side. The ""rule is"" at 3 steps right and 1 step up might be part of a rule that creates those walls. If I can remove that rule, the walls might disappear. But to do that, I need to move the ""rule is"" block. 

Alternatively, since I'm Baba, and ""baba is you,"" I can push other objects. The ""rule is"" at 3 steps right and 1 step up can be pushed. If I can move that rule away, perhaps the walls on the right would no longer be there. Let me check where I am. My position is 1 left and 1 down. To reach the ""rule is"" at 3 right and 1 up, I need to move right three times and up once. But the path might be blocked by walls. 

Wait, the walls on the right start at 4 steps right. So from my position at 1 left, moving right three steps gets me to 2 right, which is clear. Then up to 1 up, which is the position of the ""rule is."" So maybe I can push that rule block to a different location, say next to ""wall,"" to create a new rule that removes the walls.

For example, if I can move the ""rule is"" block next to ""wall"" and ""win"" or something else, I could create a new rule that changes the walls into something else. But this requires precise movement.

Alternatively, since the goal is to reach the ""win"" rule, which is up high, maybe I can create a rule that makes the door the win condition. If I can move the ""win"" rule to the door's position, then touching the door would make me win. But how to do that?

The ""win"" rule is at 9 steps right and 5 up. The door is at 1 step right. To move the ""win"" rule to the door, I need to push it left 8 steps, which seems impossible given the map's layout. The walls on the right are blocking the way up, so perhaps I need to remove those walls first.

To remove the walls on the right, I need to delete the ""rule wall"" that's causing them. The ""rule wall"" is at 1 step left and 4 step up. If I can move that rule away, the walls might disappear. Let's see: my current position is 1 left and 1 down. To get to the ""rule wall"" at 1 left and 4 up, I need to move up three times. Each move up would take me from 1 down to 4 up. But along the way, are there any obstacles? From 1 left, moving up each step should be clear since the walls are on the right side starting at 4 right. So moving up three times would get me to 1 left and 4 up, right next to the ""rule wall"" block. Then I can push it left or right. If I push it left to 0 left and 4 up, it would create a new rule ""wall 0 left 4 up,"" but that's still a wall. Alternatively, push it right to 2 left and 4 up, changing its position but not necessarily removing the wall rule. Hmm, this might not help.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule that says ""wall is stop"" or something else. But I need to have the ""is"" rule nearby to combine subjects and properties. The ""rule is"" blocks are scattered. For example, there's a ""rule is"" at 8 right and 5 up (part of the ""win"" rule), another at 7 right and 5 up, etc. If I can separate a ""rule is"" block and use it to create a new rule. 

Suppose I move a ""rule is"" block next to ""baba"" and ""stop."" Then create ""baba is stop,"" which would make me immovable. But that's bad. Alternatively, create ""baba is win,"" which would make me win. To do that, I need to be adjacent to ""baba"" and ""win"" with a ""rule is"" in between. 

The ""win"" rule is at 9 right and 5 up. My position is 1 left and 1 down. The distance is quite big. Maybe I can find a shorter path. The key is at 3 right and 4 up. If I can get the key and then use it to unlock something. But without a rule specifying that key opens door, it's not helpful.

Wait, the door is at 1 step right. If I can move to the door and push it, maybe I can move it out of the way. But the door's rule is at 8 right and 1 down, which is separate. So the actual door object is at 1 right, but the rule defining it is elsewhere. That might be a glitch or a misplacement. If I can move the door's rule, maybe I can change where the door is. For example, if I move the ""rule door"" from 8 right 1 down to 1 right 1 down, then the door would be where I want. But how to do that?

The ""rule door"" is at 8 steps right and 1 step down. To move it to 1 right 1 down, I need to push it left 7 steps. That seems impossible. Unless there's a way to break the rule apart. 

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule that says ""door is win,"" making the door the win condition. To do that, I need a ""rule is"" block next to ""door"" and ""win."" The ""win"" is up high, so again, distance is an issue. 

This is getting complicated. Maybe the simplest way is to move towards the key, pick it up, and then use it to unlock the door. But since there's no existing rule for that, it might not work. Alternatively, create a rule that says ""key is win"" and place it near the key. Then pick up the key and move it to the win position. 

To create ""key is win,"" I need a ""rule is"" block. The available ""rule is"" blocks are at various positions. For example, there's one at 3 right 1 up. If I can move that ""rule is"" block next to ""key"" and ""win,"" I can form the new rule. 

Let me try to plan the steps:

1. Move from current position (1 left, 1 down) to the key at 3 right, 4 up.
   - Need to move right 4 times, up 3 times. But the path might be blocked by walls on the right. Wait, the walls on the right start at 4 right. So moving right from 1 left to 3 right is clear. Then up to 4 up, which is where the key is. So possible.

2. Once at the key, push it towards the door at 1 right. But the door is at 1 right, which is to the left of the key's current position (3 right). So pushing the key left 2 steps to reach the door. But the door is 1 right, so the key would be at 2 right, next to the door. Then, if there's a rule like ""door is key,"" but we need to create that rule.

3. To create ""door is key,"" need a ""rule is"" block. The nearest ""rule is"" is at 3 right 1 up. So move from the key's position (3 right, 4 up) to 3 right 1 up, which is down 3 steps. Then move left to the door's position (1 right) and create the rule.

But this is a lot of steps and requires precise movement. Alternatively, maybe there's a closer ""rule is"" block. There's one at 4 right 1 up. If I can move that to the door area.

Alternatively, maybe focus on creating ""baba is win."" To do that, I need to be adjacent to ""win"" and have a ""rule is"" block between me and ""win."" The ""win"" is at 9 right 5 up. That's far away, but maybe I can find a shortcut.

Another idea: the ""rule you"" is at 2 steps right and 1 step down. Since I'm Baba and ""baba is you,"" maybe I can push the ""you"" rule to create a new rule. For example, push ""you"" to where ""win"" is, making ""you is win,"" but that requires being next to ""win.""

This is really tricky. Maybe the key is essential here. If I can get the key and then use it to unlock the door, which is the exit. But without a rule, how? 

Wait, in Baba Is You, sometimes pushing the key to a door that has a ""key"" rule automatically unlocks it. But in this case, there's no such rule. However, if I can create a rule ""door is key,"" then placing the key near the door would make it work. 

So here's the plan:

1. Move to the key at 3 right 4 up.
2. Push the key to the door at 1 right.
3. Create a rule ""door is key"" by placing a ""rule is"" block between ""door"" and ""key.""
4. Now, touching the door would satisfy ""door is key,"" and if there's a rule that ""key unlocks door,"" but since we only have ""door is key,"" maybe just touching the door would work if there's a win rule related to it.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, create ""win is door,"" so touching the door makes me win. 

To create ""win is door,"" need to rearrange the existing ""win"" rule. The ""win"" rule is at 9 right 5 up, which is ""win 9 steps right 5 up."" If I can move that rule to the door's position (1 right), making it ""win 1 step right,"" then touching the door would make me win. 

To do that, I need to push the ""win"" rule left 8 steps. But moving it manually would require being adjacent and pushing it left each step, which is possible but time-consuming. 

Alternatively, break the ""win"" rule into parts. The ""win"" rule is formed by ""rule is"" at 8 right 5 up, then ""win"" at 9 right 5 up, and another ""rule is"" at 7 right 5 up. If I can separate these and rearrange them.

This is getting too complex. Maybe the simplest valid action right now is to move right towards the door, since it's adjacent, and see if I can pass through. Even if it doesn't help, maybe it progresses the game. 

Looking back at the latest observation, after previous actions, the map is similar. The assistant's previous actions kept failing, possibly because the model isn't finding a valid path. Maybe the correct action is to move right towards the door, as it's the closest accessible object, and see what happens. If the door isn't stop, I can pass through it, reaching the area beyond, which might have the key or the win condition.

Let's see. In this Baba Is You level, the active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I can manipulate the environment by moving text blocks. My goal is usually to reach the ""win"" condition, but that might have changed.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key located at 2 steps to the right and 4 steps up. There's also a door at 7 steps to the right and 1 step down. The ""win"" rule is 9 steps to the right and 5 steps up, which seems pretty far. But maybe I can alter the rules to make reaching it easier.

Wait, there are several ""rule `is`"" blocks scattered around. The idea is to move them to create new rules. For example, if I can move a ""win"" text block next to a different object, maybe that object becomes the new_win. Or if I can make ""baba"" have other properties like ""push"" or ""win,"" that could help.

Looking at my current position, ""rule `baba`"" is 1 step to the left and 1 step down. So I might be adjacent to that text block. Since I'm Baba and can move, I can try to pick up that ""baba"" rule and move it. But wait, can I move text blocks? Only if they aren't defined as ""STOP"" or similar. Let me check the active rules again. The only stop is at 4 steps up, which isn't in the way here.

So, if I move the ""baba"" rule to somewhere else, maybe I can say ""baba is win,"" making myself the win condition. That would let me stand on myself and win. Let me see where the ""win"" rule is. It's at 9 steps to the right and 5 steps up. That's quite far. Alternatively, maybe there's a closer ""is"" block I can use.

There's a ""rule `is`"" at 3 steps to the right and 1 step up. If I can move the ""baba"" rule next to that ""is"" and then add ""win"" next to it, forming ""baba is win,"" that would work. But how to get there? My current position is near the ""baba"" rule. Let me check the map again.

Wait, the door is at 7 steps right and 1 step down. Maybe that's a way to proceed, but doors are usually ""stop"" unless the rule says otherwise. The active rules still have ""baba is you,"" so if I can get to the door and change its rule, maybe ""door is not stop."" But first, I need to reach it.

Alternatively, the key at 2 steps right and 4 up. Maybe I need to get the key first, but I don't see a ""key is push"" or anything. The key's position is 2 steps right and 4 up. From my current position, which seems to be near the ""baba"" rule at 1 left and 1 down, moving up and right might be the way. But the path is blocked by walls at 4 steps right and up to 5 steps up. Wait, the walls are to the right and up, so maybe I need to go around them.

Wait, the walls are vertically aligned to the right. So moving up from my current position might hit a wall. Let me visualize the map. If I'm at the position of ""baba"" rule (1 left, 1 down), then moving right would take me towards the walls at 4 steps right. But maybe there's a gap. Alternatively, moving up from there could lead to the ""is"" rules higher up.

Alternatively, the goal is to manipulate the rules. The key might not be necessary right now. Let's focus on the ""baba is you"" rule. Since I'm Baba, I can move text blocks. The ""is"" rules are movable. So if I can take the ""baba"" rule and place it next to an ""is"" and then add ""win"" next to it, forming ""baba is win,"" that would make me win.

But where is the ""win"" text block? It's at 9 steps right and 5 up. That's quite far. Alternatively, maybe there's a closer ""win"" rule I can interact with. Wait, the active rules list ""rule `win` 9 steps to the right and 5 step up,"" so that's the original win condition. I need to either reach that location or change the rule.

To change the rule, I need to move the ""win"" text block. Let's see. If I can move the ""win"" block to be next to ""baba"" and ""is,"" then the rule would become ""baba is win."" But how to move it? I need to be adjacent to the ""win"" block and move in a direction that carries it with me. Since I'm Baba and can push things (assuming ""baba is push"" isn't a rule, but by default, you can push objects unless they're stop), but in this case, the only stop is the wall at 4 steps up.

So, if I move towards the ""win"" block at 9 steps right and 5 up, but there are walls blocking the path. The walls are at 4 steps right and up to 5 steps. So from my current position, moving right multiple times would hit those walls. Maybe I need to go around them by moving up or down.

Alternatively, use the ""is"" rules to create new rules. For example, take the ""is"" at 3 steps right and 1 step up, move it next to ""baba"" and ""win"" to form ""baba is win."" But how to position them.

Wait, the ""baba"" rule is at 1 left and 1 down from my current position. So if I move right twice, I can reach the ""is"" at 3 steps right and 1 step up. Then, move that ""is"" next to the ""baba"" rule and the ""win"" rule. But the ""win"" is far away. Maybe there's another way.

Alternatively, create a new rule ""you is win"" but since I'm Baba and ""baba is you,"" that would make ""you is win"" equivalent to ""baba is win."" Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another approach: if I can make the door a win by moving the ""win"" rule next to the door. The door is at 7 steps right and 1 step down. So if I can move the ""win"" rule there, then standing on the door would make it the win condition. To do that, I need to carry the ""win"" block to the door's position. But again, the path is blocked by walls at 4 steps right.

Maybe I need to dig through the walls by moving them. But walls are ""stop,"" so I can't move them unless I have a rule that allows it. Since the only active rule is ""baba is you,"" and unless I create a rule like ""wall is push"" or ""wall is not stop,"" I can't move the walls.

Alternatively, use the key. The key is at 2 steps right and 4 up. If I can get the key and then use it to unlock something, but I don't see a lock object. Maybe the key is a red herring, or maybe it's needed to access a different part of the level.

Wait, the door is at 1 step right. If I could make the door not a stop, then I could go through it. To do that, I need to change the ""stop"" rule. The ""stop"" rule is at 4 step up. If I can move the ""stop"" rule away and create a new rule like ""door is not stop,"" that would help. But how?

Let me think step by step. My current capabilities: I'm Baba, can move in directions, and can push objects (assuming default pushability unless stopped). The walls are stop, so I can't walk through them. The key is nearby but surrounded by walls? Let me check the map again.

The key is at 2 steps right and 4 up. The walls around there are at 4 steps right and up to 5 steps. So from the key's position, moving right would hit a wall at 4 steps right. But the key is at 2 steps right, so maybe there's a path to the key by moving up and right?

Wait, the key is at 2 right, 4 up. If I'm at the ""baba"" rule position (1 left, 1 down), moving right twice gets me to 1 right, then another step right to 2 right (key's position). But then moving up from there to 4 up would hit the wall at 4 steps right and 4 up. So maybe I can't get to the key directly because of the walls.

Alternative plan: focus on rule manipulation. The ""is"" rules are movable. If I can take the ""baba"" rule and place it next to an ""is"" and then add ""win"" next to it, forming ""baba is win."" But where is the ""win"" text block? It's at 9 right, 5 up. That's far. Unless I can move the ""win"" block closer.

Alternatively, create a new rule ""win is baba,"" which would make wherever Baba is the win condition. To do that, I need to move the ""win"" block next to ""baba"" and ""is."" Let's see. If I can move the ""win"" block to be adjacent to the ""baba"" rule and the ""is"" rule, then the rule becomes ""baba is win.""

But the ""win"" block is at 9 right, 5 up. How to get it there? To move the ""win"" block, I need to be adjacent to it and push it. Since I'm Baba, and assuming I can push (as I have no ""stop"" rule restricting me), I could move towards the ""win"" block. But the path is blocked by walls at 4 steps right. So moving right from my current position: I'm at ""baba"" rule (1 left, 1 down), which I think means my position is somewhere in the grid. Let me try to map this out mentally.

Assuming my current position is at coordinates (0,0), then:

- The ""baba"" rule is at (-1, -1).
- The ""is"" rule at (1 step down) would be at (0, -1).
- The ""you"" rule is at (1 step to the right and 1 step down), so (1, -1).
- The walls are at (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), and (5,5), etc., up to the right.
- The ""win"" rule is at (9,5).

So the grid is fairly large to the right and up. The walls block the path to the ""win"" and ""door"" objects. To reach the ""win"" rule, I'd have to go around the walls, but they're all the way to the right at x=4, so moving right from x=0 would get blocked at x=4.

Therefore, maybe the intended solution is to manipulate the rules to make Baba the win condition. Since ""baba is you,"" if I can create a rule ""baba is win,"" then touching any Baba (which is me) would satisfy the win condition.

To do that, I need to move the ""win"" text block next to the ""baba"" text block and an ""is"" text block. Let's see where the ""is"" blocks are. There's one at (8,5), same as the ""win"" rule's x-coordinate but one less in y? Wait, the ""is"" at 8 steps right and 5 step up would be at (8,5), and the ""win"" is at (9,5). So they're adjacent horizontally. If I can move the ""baba"" rule to be next to them, then the rule would be ""baba is win.""

The ""baba"" rule is currently at (-1, -1). To get it to (8,5), I need to move it all the way across, which is blocked by walls. So that's not feasible.

Alternative idea: use the ""is"" block at (3,1). If I can move the ""baba"" rule to (3,1), and then place the ""win"" rule next to it, forming ""baba is win."" But the ""win"" rule is at (9,5), which is far away.

Wait, maybe there's a closer ""win"" rule? No, the only ""win"" is at (9,5). So perhaps this isn't the right approach.

Another angle: the door is at (1, -1), which is one step to the right from my current position (since ""baba"" is at (-1,-1), moving right once gets to (0,-1), then right again to (1,-1), which is the door. But the door is a ""rule `door`"" at (1,-1). If I can change the door's rule to ""win,"" then stepping on it would win. To do that, I need to move the ""win"" rule next to the door and an ""is"" rule.

The ""win"" rule is at (9,5). To get it to (1,-1), that's a long way. Alternatively, use the ""is"" rule at (8,5) which is adjacent to the ""win"" rule. If I can move the ""door"" rule next to ""win"" and ""is,"" but the door is at (1,-1), which is far.

Alternatively, create a rule like ""door is win"" by moving the ""win"" block next to the door and an ""is"" block. But again, moving the ""win"" block there is impossible due to walls.

Wait, maybe the key is involved. If I can get the key and then use it to unlock the door, but there's no lock object mentioned. Alternatively, the key might be needed to access a different area, but the current observation doesn't show any locked doors or keyholes.

Hmm. This is tricky. Let me recap:

- I'm Baba, can move and push.
- Active rule: ""baba is you.""
- Need to reach ""win,"" which is at (9,5), but blocked by walls.
- Possible solutions: change the win condition to something I can reach, or find a way around the walls.

Since altering the win condition seems more feasible, let's focus on that. To make ""baba is win,"" need to place the ""win"" text block next to ""baba"" and ""is.""

The closest ""is"" block is at (8,5), same y as ""win"" at (9,5). So if I can move the ""baba"" rule to (8,5), between the ""is"" and ""win,"" then the rule becomes ""baba is win."" But moving the ""baba"" rule from (-1,-1) to (8,5) is impossible due to walls at x=4.

Alternative idea: Use the ""is"" block at (3,1). If I can move the ""baba"" rule to (3,1) and the ""win"" rule next to it, but the ""win"" is too far.

Wait, maybe there's a way to use the existing ""is"" blocks to create a chain. For example, move ""baba"" next to ""is"" at (3,1), then move ""win"" next to that, but again, the ""win"" is far.

Another approach: Maybe the door at (1,-1) can be made into a win. If I can move the ""win"" rule to (1,-1) and have an ""is"" there, then ""door is win"" would make stepping on the door win. But moving the ""win"" rule there is impossible.

Wait, the ""door"" rule is at (7 steps to the right and 1 step down), which is (7,-1). So different position.

Alternatively, use the ""you"" rule. Since ""baba is you,"" if I can make ""you is win,"" that would also work. But ""you"" is at (1, -1). So if I can move the ""win"" rule next to ""you"" and an ""is,"" forming ""you is win,"" which is equivalent to ""baba is win."" But again, moving ""win"" there is blocked.

I think the key here is to realize that the ""win"" rule is at (9,5), but maybe there's a way to reach it by manipulating other rules. Alternatively, the level might require pushing blocks to create a path.

Wait, the walls are at x=4, but what's beyond them? If I can move the walls by creating a ""wall is push"" rule, then I could push them aside. But to do that, I need to create ""wall is push"" by moving the relevant text blocks.

For example, take the ""is"" block at (8,5), move it next to ""wall"" and ""push"" to form ""wall is push."" But where is the ""push"" rule? I don't see it in the active rules. The active rules only have ""baba is you.""

So unless there's a ""push"" text block on the map, I can't create that rule. Looking back at the objects, the only rules are ""is,"" ""win,"" ""wall,"" ""stop,"" ""key,"" and ""door."" No ""push"" or other properties.

Therefore, pushing walls isn't possible. So I'm stuck with the walls blocking the path to the win condition.

Alternative plan: Since I can move text blocks, maybe I can create a new rule that allows me to walk through walls. For example, ""wall is stop"" is already there, but if I can remove that or change it to ""wall is not stop.""

To do that, I need to move the ""stop"" rule. The ""stop"" rule is at (4,4). If I can move it away, then I could create a new rule like ""wall is not stop."" But how?

The ""stop"" rule is at (4,4). To move it, I need to be adjacent to it and push it. Since I'm Baba and can push (assuming), I could move left or down. Let's see: from (4,4), moving left would take it to (3,4), but is that clear? Looking at the map, there's a wall at (4,4) which is part of the vertical wall at x=4. So moving the ""stop"" rule left might be possible if there's no wall there.

But the map shows walls at (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), etc., down to (4,1). So the ""stop"" rule is at (4,4), which is part of the wall. If I move the ""stop"" rule left to (3,4), then the wall at (4,4","

76,right,"<reasoning>
Let's take a look at the current state of the game. The active rule is still ""baba is you,"" which means whatever I move, I become that object. On the map, there are several walls, rules, a key, a door, and a win rule positioned up high.

First, I need to figure out where Baba is located. Scanning the objects, there's a ""rule `baba`"" 1 step to the left and 1 step down from the center. So, if I move left or down from there, I can reach Baba. But wait, the current active rule is ""baba is you,"" so I can move Baba around by moving the text block that says ""baba"" or the ""is"" and ""you"" rules.

Looking at the objectives, the ""win"" rule is way up at 10 steps to the right and 5 steps up. That's probably out of reach directly. But the door is 1 step to the right, which might be a way to progress. To get to the door, I might need to move the key first, but the key is at 2 steps right and 4 steps up, behind some walls. Alternatively, maybe I can manipulate the rules to change what's a stop or make walls passable.

The ""stop"" rule is at 4 steps up. If I can remove or change that rule, maybe the walls above become movable. But to do that, I need to move the ""stop"" text block. However, the ""stop"" rule is on a wall, so I can only move it if the wall isn't considered stop. Wait, the current rules are ""baba is you,"" so I can move any object that isn't stop. But the wall with the ""stop"" rule is a stop, right? So I can't move that wall. Hmm, that complicates things.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule that negates ""stop."" For example, ""wall is not stop."" But to do that, I need to find the ""is"" rule and rearrange the text blocks. The ""is"" rule is at 8 steps right and 5 steps up. If I can move the ""is"" rule to connect ""wall"" with ""not stop,"" that might make the walls passable. But how do I form that new rule? I need to have the ""wall"" text block, ""is,"" and ""not stop"" in the correct order. However, the available text blocks might not include ""not,"" so maybe I have to use existing blocks. 

Looking at the objects, there's a ""rule `win`"" up high, but I can't reach it yet. The key is closer, but it's blocked by walls. Maybe moving the ""key"" rule to a different position? Wait, the ""key"" rule is at 8 steps right and 1 step up. If I can pick up the ""key"" rule and place it somewhere else, maybe I can use it to unlock the door. But the door is 1 step to the right, and it's associated with a ""door"" rule at 7 steps right and 1 step down. 

Another angle: since Baba is you, maybe I can push the door by moving towards it. But the door is a ""door"" object, and the rule for door is ""door is door"" by default, unless changed. To enter the door, maybe I need to be ""win,"" but the active rule is still ""baba is you."" So unless I change the ""win"" condition, touching the door won't do anything. 

Wait, the ""win"" rule is up at 10 steps right and 5 steps up. If I could move that down to where I am, then touching it would make me win. To do that, I need to move the ""win"" text block. But the ""win"" rule is on a wall at 10 steps right and 5 steps up. Since that wall is a stop, I can't move it. Unless I can remove the ""wall"" property from that wall. If I can change the rule ""wall is you"" or something, but I don't have a ""you"" rule for wall. 

Alternatively, if I can make the ""win"" rule follow Baba, maybe by adding ""baba is win."" But to do that, I need to find the ""is"" rule and rearrange the text blocks. The ""is"" rule is at 8 steps right and 5 steps up. If I move the ""is"" to connect ""baba"" with ""win,"" then ""baba is win"" would be active, making touching anything (including walls) count as winning. But how do I get the ""baba"" text block close enough? 

Baba's rule is at 1 step left and 1 step down. If I move down from there, I can reach the ""is"" rule at 8 steps right and 5 steps up. Wait, no, the positions are relative. Let me visualize the map. The player (Baba) is near the bottom, maybe at position (0,0). The ""baba"" rule is 1 left and 1 down from there, so at (-1, -1). The ""is"" rule is 8 right and 5 up from the player's position, so at (8,5). To move the ""is"" rule, I need to be able to reach it. But there are walls blocking the path. 

The walls are aligned to the right at various positions. From the player's position, moving right into the walls at 4 steps right and up to 5 steps up would be blocked. Maybe there's a path around by moving up first? But the ""stop"" rule is at 4 steps up, which might make that wall immovable. 

Alternatively, focus on the lower part. The ""you"" rule is 1 step to the right and 1 step down from the player's ""baba"" rule. So at (-1 +1, -1 +1) = (0,0), which is the player's position? Wait, maybe the coordinates are relative. This is getting a bit confusing. 

Another approach: since the active rule is ""baba is you,"" I can move any object that isn't stop. The ""stop"" rule is at 4 steps up, but that's on a wall, which is stop. So I can't move that wall. The key is at 2 right, 4 up. To get the key, I might need to move around the walls. But the walls at 4 right and up to 5 up are solid. 

Wait, the ""key"" is at 2 steps right and 4 steps up. If I can move the ""key"" rule to a different location, maybe near the door, then I can pick up the key and use it. But how? To move the ""key"" rule, I need to be adjacent to it and move it in a direction. Since I'm Baba, and ""baba is you,"" I can pick up the ""key"" rule if it's not stop. The key's rule is ""rule `key` 9 steps to the right and 1 step up,"" which means the key itself is an object at 3 steps right and 4 step up (wait, maybe the coordinates are different). This is getting a bit tangled. 

Perhaps the solution is to move the ""is"" rule to create a new rule that changes the win condition. For example, moving ""is"" next to ""baba"" and ""win"" to make ""baba is win."" That way, touching anything would make you win. To do this, I need to navigate to the ""is"" rule at 8 right and 5 up, then move it to connect with ""baba"" and ""win."" But the path is blocked by walls. 

Alternatively, look for the ""you"" rule. The ""you"" rule is at 1 step right and 1 step down from the player's ""baba"" rule. So if I move right and down, I can reach the ""you"" rule. Maybe changing ""you"" to something else. For instance, making ""baba is you"" and ""wall is you,"" so both are you. Then I could push walls. But I need to manipulate the text blocks. 

Another thought: the door is 1 step to the right. If I can make the door a ""win"" by moving the ""win"" rule next to the door, then touching the door would win. The ""win"" rule is currently at 10 right, 5 up. To move it down to the door's position (1 right, 1 down), I need to carry the ""win"" rule there. But the path is blocked by walls. 

Wait, the ""door"" rule is at 7 steps right and 1 step down. The door object itself is 1 step to the right. Maybe if I can make the door a win by attaching the ""win"" rule to it. But again, the ""win"" rule is blocked by walls. 

This is quite challenging. Let me recap the possible actions:

1. Move towards the ""is"" rule to create new rules.
2. Try to push walls by making them you (but need to change rules).
3. Obtain the key and use it on the door, but door is 1 step right.
4. Change the win condition to be something reachable.

Given the active rules, the priority is to manipulate the ""is"" rule to create a favorable rule. For example, ""baba is win"" would make touching anything win. To do this, I need to move the ""is"" text block next to ""baba"" and ""win."" 

The ""is"" rule is at 8 right, 5 up. The ""baba"" text block is at 1 left, 1 down. The ""win"" rule is at 10 right, 5 up. It's a long distance, but maybe possible by moving up and right, avoiding walls. However, the walls at 4 right and up to 5 up are stop, so I can't pass through them. 

Alternatively, find a different path. Move down to the lower rules. The ""is"" rule at 3 steps right and 1 step up might be more accessible. If I can move that ""is"" rule to connect ""baba"" with ""win,"" that could work. 

The ""baba"" rule is at 1 left, 1 down. The ""is"" rule is at 3 right, 1 up. So moving right and up from the player's position (assuming player is at origin), the player needs to go to (3,1). But there's a wall at 4 right and various ups. 

This is getting too complicated. Maybe the simplest action is to move towards the nearest movable object, like the ""is"" rule at 8 right, 5 up, even if blocked. But how? Unless there's a way to make the path clear by changing rules. 

Wait, the ""key"" is at 2 right, 4 up. If I can move the key to a nearby ""is"" rule, maybe I can create a new rule. But the key is an object, not a rule. Unless I can use the key to interact with a rule. 

Alternatively, since the key is at 3 right, 4 up (from the observation), maybe moving down to get closer. But the player is at the position of the ""baba"" rule, which is 1 left, 1 down from the origin. So moving right and up might get closer to the key. 

I think the most feasible action is to move right towards the ""is"" rule at 8 right, 5 up, navigating around the walls. But the walls at 4 right and up to 5 up are stop, so I can't pass through. Therefore, maybe the correct action is to move left to avoid the walls and find another path. 

Alternatively, move down towards the lower ""is"" rule at 3 right, 1 up. From the player's position (assuming origin), moving down 1 step would bring them to the ""you"" rule at 1 right, 1 down. Then moving right and up to reach the lower ""is"" rule. 

This is quite tricky. Given the time I've spent and the previous failures, maybe the best action is to keep moving right towards the ""is"" rule, hoping to eventually reach it and rearrange the rules to make ""baba is win.""

Let's try to figure out how to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. The goal is usually to reach the ""win"" condition, which is probably the door or something similar. But I remember that in Baba Is You, the rules can be changed by moving the text blocks.

Looking at the current observation, the active rule is ""baba is you"". That means whatever Baba does, I can do because I'm Baba. The objects on the map include walls, keys, doors, and some rules. The ""win"" is positioned at 8 steps to the right and 5 steps up, but there's a ""rule win"" there. Wait, does that mean I need to move the ""win"" text block to a different place to change what counts as a win?

There's a key at 1 step to the right and 4 steps up. Maybe I need to get that key first to unlock something. But how do I move the key? Since I'm Baba, and ""baba is you"", I can push objects unless they're defined as ""stop"". Looking at the rules, there's a ""rule stop 4 step up"". That might be a wall or another object that's stopping me from moving certain things.

The door is at 1 step to the left, but it's probably behind a wall. The walls are all aligned to the right, except for the ones at the left side. The ""door"" rule is at 6 steps to the right and 1 step down. Maybe that's the actual door object. But how do I get to it?

Wait, the key is at 1 step right and 4 steps up. If I can move that key, maybe I can use it to open a door. But to move the key, I might need to push it. Since I'm Baba, and there's no rule saying keys can't be moved, I should be able to move the key. But the path might be blocked by walls. Let me check the layout.

Looking at the walls: there are walls at 3 steps right and 5 up, decreasing down to 2 step up, and then a rule ""is"" at 2 steps right and 1 step up. The key is at 1 step right and 4 step up, next to a wall. So maybe I can move right to get to the key. But the ""stop"" rule is at 1 step left and 4 step up, which could be a wall that's stopping me from moving left into that area.

Alternatively, maybe I need to create a new rule. For example, if I can move the ""win"" text block to be under ""baba"", then I could make myself the win condition. But to do that, I need to push the ""win"" rule somewhere. The ""win"" is at 8 steps right and 5 steps up. If I can move that rule down or left, maybe next to Baba, then ""baba is win"" would make me the win condition.

But how do I move the ""win"" rule? I would have to be adjacent to it and move in a direction. The ""is"" rule is at 7 steps right and 5 steps up, next to ""win"". So maybe I can move the ""is"" first, then the ""win"". But to move the ""is"", I need to be next to it. My current position is at the ""baba"" rule, which is 2 steps left and 1 step down. So I need to move towards the upper right area where the ""is"" and ""win"" rules are.

Wait, the active rule is ""baba is you"", so I can move any object that's not stopped. The ""stop"" rule is at 4 step up, which might be a wall. Let me try to navigate to the ""is"" rule at 7 steps right and 5 steps up. To get there, I need to move right multiple times. But the walls are at 3 steps right and 4 steps up, so moving right from my current position (which is at the ""baba"" rule, 2 left and 1 down) would take me through the walls. Maybe there's a path.

Alternatively, maybe I should first move down to the area where the ""you"" rule is, which is at 1 step down. If I can make ""baba is win"" or ""you is win"", that could change the outcome. But to do that, I need to move the ""win"" rule. Let me think step by step.

Current position: Assuming I'm at the ""baba"" rule's location, which is 2 steps left and 1 step down from the starting point. But maybe my actual position is implied by the objects. Wait, the observations list objects with their positions relative to where? Probably relative to the player's position. But in the problem statement, the assistant needs to determine actions based on the given observations.

Alternatively, maybe the observations are given from the player's perspective, and the objects are positioned in relative directions. For example, ""wall 3 steps to the right and 5 step up"" means there's a wall in that direction from the player's current position.

So, to reach the ""win"" object at 8 steps right and 5 up, I need to move right and up. But there's a wall at 3 steps right and 5 up, and the ""is"" rule at 7 steps right and 5 up. Maybe I can move past the ""is"" and ""win"" rules. But how?

Alternatively, if I can move the ""win"" rule to a different position, like next to Baba, then ""baba is win"" would make me the win condition. To move the ""win"" rule, I need to be adjacent to it and push it. The ""win"" is at 8 right, 5 up. The ""is"" is at 7 right,5 up. So if I move right from the ""is"" rule, I can get to the ""win"" rule. But to get to the ""is"" rule, I need to move right and up.

Wait, my current position is at the ""baba"" rule, which is 2 left and 1 down. So to move right, I would be going towards the ""is"" and ""win"" rules. Let's see:

If I move right once, that would be 1 step right from the ""baba"" rule's position. But the ""baba"" rule is itself an object. Wait, maybe the player is represented by the ""baba"" text block. So the player is at the location of the ""baba"" rule, which is 2 steps left and 1 step down from some reference point. Therefore, to move right, the player would adjust their position accordingly.

This is a bit confusing. Let me try to visualize the map based on the observations.

Assuming the player is at the ""baba"" rule's position (2 left, 1 down), the surroundings are:

- To the right (decreasing left steps): There's a wall at 3 steps right and 5 up. Wait, no, the wall is 3 steps to the right and 5 steps up from the player's position. So if the player is at (0,0), the wall is at (3,5). The ""is"" rule is at (7,5), ""win"" at (8,5). The key is at (1,4). The door is at (-1,0) (since 1 step to the left). 

The ""stop"" rule is at (-1,4) (1 step left, 4 up). So there's a wall there that's stoppable. The player needs to navigate around these.

The goal is to reach the ""win"" object, but it's blocked by the ""win"" rule. To make Baba the win condition, the player needs to create a rule like ""baba is win"". To do that, they need to move the ""win"" text block next to the ""baba"" text block.

The player's current position is at the ""baba"" rule (2 left, 1 down). To get to the ""win"" rule at (8,5), the player would need to move right and up. However, there's a wall at (3,5) and an ""is"" at (7,5). So perhaps the path is blocked. Alternatively, the player can move the ""is"" rule first, then the ""win"" rule.

To move the ""is"" rule at (7,5), the player needs to be adjacent to it. From the player's position (2 left, 1 down), moving right 5 steps and up 4 steps would get to (7,5), but there's a wall at (3,5) which is a stop. So the player can't move through walls. Therefore, they need to find a way around.

Alternatively, maybe the player can move horizontally first. From the ""baba"" rule's position (2 left, 1 down), moving right multiple times: right to (1 left, 1 down), then right again to (0, 1 down), but is there a wall there? The walls are at 3 steps right and upwards, so maybe moving right is possible until hitting the walls.

Wait, the walls are at 3 steps right and 5 up, 4 up, 3 up, etc. So vertically upwards from the player's position, there are walls starting at 3 steps right. To move up, the player would have to go around those walls.

This is getting complicated. Maybe another approach: since the player is Baba and can push objects that aren't stopped, they can push the ""key"" to get it, then use the key to open a door. But the door is at 1 step left, which might be unlocked already, or maybe the key opens it. However, the door's rule is at 6 steps right and 1 step down. Not sure.

Alternatively, create a ""flag is win"" rule or something, but I don't see a flag here. The main thing is to manipulate the rules. The key is probably a red herring, or needed to unlock a hidden path.

Wait, the ""door"" is at 1 step to the left. If I can move left past the door, but there's a wall at 3 steps right and 5 up, but leftwards, the door is at (-1,0). The ""stop"" rule is at (-1,4), so maybe moving left isn't blocked by a stop, but there's a wall at (-1,0) which is the door. If the door is a stop, then I can't go through it. Unless the door's rule is changed.

But the active rule is still ""baba is you"", so unless I change the door's behavior, it's a stop. So maybe I need to make the door not a stop. For example, if I can move the ""stop"" rule away from the door.

The ""stop"" rule is at (-1,4). If I can move that ""stop"" rule elsewhere, then the door at (-1,0) would no longer be a stop, and I could walk through. But how?

To move the ""stop"" rule, I need to be adjacent to it and move it. The ""stop"" is at (-1,4), which is 1 step left and 4 steps up from the player's position. The player is at (2 left, 1 down), so the distance to the ""stop"" is quite far. They would need to move left and up multiple times, but there are walls in the way.

Alternatively, maybe create a rule that allows pushing through stops. But there's no such rule active right now.

This is tricky. Let's recap the active rules: only ""baba is you"". All other objects are either walls, keys, doors, or rules. The key is at (1,4), which is 1 step right and 4 up from the player. If the player can get to the key and move it, maybe they can use it to unlock something. But how to reach the key?

The path to the key is blocked by a wall at (3,5) and the ""is"" rule at (7,5). To get to the key at (1,4), the player would need to move right and up, but there's no indication of walls blocking that path. Wait, the walls are listed as:

- wall 3 steps to the right and 5 step up
- wall 4 steps to the right and 4 step up
- etc., down to 2 step up.

So vertically, from the player's position upwards, there are walls starting at 3 steps right. horizontally, the walls are at 3,4,5 steps right at various heights.

To reach the key at (1,4), the player would move right once (to 1 left, 1 down), then up four steps. But between the player and the key, there's nothing mentioned except the walls at higher right positions. So maybe the path is clear to the key.

If the player moves right, then up, they can reach the key. Once they have the key, maybe they can use it to open the door at (-1,0). But how?

Alternatively, after getting the key, move to the door and unlock it. But without a rule that says ""key opens door"", this might not work. In Baba Is You, sometimes keys are used to move other objects, but here, the door is a separate object.

Another angle: since the player is Baba and ""baba is you"", they can push other objects. The ""key"" is an object; if the player moves right to the key's location, they can pick it up and carry it. But in Baba Is You, you can push objects by moving into them from the side. So to move the key, the player needs to be adjacent to it and move in a direction that pushes it.

The key is at (1,4). The player is at (2 left, 1 down), which is (assuming 0,0 is the player's start) maybe (2,-1). So the key is at (1,4). To move right to the key, the player would move right once (to 1 left, -1), then up four times to reach (1,4). But along the way, are there any stops?

The ""stop"" rule is at (-1,4), which is 1 step left and 4 up from the player's start. So if the player moves up to (1,4), they would pass through (-1,4) which is a stop. But since the player is Baba and can move unless stopped, but the stop rule is at (-1,4), which is a wall. So moving from (0,0) to (-1,4) would be blocked by the stop wall. Therefore, the player can't move directly up to the key because of the stop wall at (-1,4).

This is a problem. So the key is behind a stop wall. Unless the player can remove or move the stop rule.

The ""stop"" rule is at (-1,4). To move it, the player needs to be adjacent to it. The player's current position is at (2 left, 1 down), so to reach (-1,4), they need to move left 3 times and up 5 times. But along the way, there are walls at 3 steps right and higher up, which are stops. So it's impossible to get to the stop rule to move it.

Alternative plan: Instead of getting the key, focus on manipulating the rules to make Baba the win condition. The ""win"" rule is at (8,5). If the player can move the ""win"" rule next to the ""baba"" rule, then ""baba is win"" would make the player win.

To move the ""win"" rule, the player needs to push it. The ""win"" is at (8,5), and the ""is"" is at (7,5). So if the player can move the ""is"" rule to the left, then the ""win"" rule can be moved into place.

The ""is"" rule is at (7,5). To move it left, the player needs to be adjacent to it. From the player's position at (2 left,1 down), moving right 5 times and up 4 times would reach (7,5). But again, there's a wall at (3,5) which is a stop, blocking the path.

This seems impossible. Maybe there's another way. What if the player creates a new rule that says ""flag is win"", but there's no flag. Alternatively, ""you is win"", but the ""you"" rule is at (1 step down), which is separate.

Wait, the ""you"" rule is at (1 step down) relative to the player's position. So if the player can move the ""you"" rule to be under ""baba"", then ""baba is you win"" or something. But the syntax requires ""[Subject] IS [Property]"". So ""baba is you"" is a rule, and ""you is win"" would make you the win condition.

If the player can move the ""you"" rule next to the ""win"" rule, then ""you is win"" would make whoever is ""you"" the win condition. Since the player is ""baba is you"", they would be the win condition.

To do that, the player needs to move the ""you"" rule (at 1 step down) and the ""win"" rule (at 8,5) into proximity. But moving the ""you"" rule requires being adjacent to it. The ""you"" rule is at (player's position) 1 step down, so if the player moves down, they can get to it.

The player's current position is at the ""baba"" rule, which is 2 left and 1 down. Moving down once would place them at 2 left and 2 down. There's a wall at 3 steps right and 1 step up, but that's not in the way. The ""you"" rule is at 1 step down from the player's current position, so moving down once gets them to the ""you"" rule.

Once there, the player can push the ""you"" rule. For example, moving right would push the ""you"" rule to the right. Then, move the ""win"" rule to the right as well, so that ""you is win"" is formed.

But the ""win"" rule is at 8,5, which is far away. This seems complicated.

Alternatively, create a new rule ""baba is win"" by moving the ""win"" rule next to the ""baba"" rule. The ""baba"" rule is at 2 left and 1 down. The ""win"" rule is at 8,5. The distance is too great, but maybe by pushing intermediate rules.

The ""is"" rule is between the ""win"" and the rest. If the player can move the ""is"" rule left, then the ""win"" can be moved left. For example:

1. Move ""is"" at (7,5) left to (6,5).
2. Then move ""win"" at (8,5) left to (7,5).

Let's see. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I can move around. The goal is usually to reach the ""win"" object, which is currently defined as a ""door"" somewhere. I need to figure out how to get there.

Looking at the objects, there's a key at 1 step right and 4 step up. Maybe I need that to unlock something? But there's a wall blocking the path. Wait, the rule ""stop"" is at 1 step left and 4 step up. So any object with ""stop"" can't be moved through. But since I'm Baba and ""baba is you,"" maybe I can move other objects that aren't stopped. Let me check the positions.

The key is on a wall at 4 steps right and 4 step up. To get to the key, I need to move up or right. But there are walls blocking the way. The ""is"" rule is at 7 steps right and 5 step up. Maybe I can move that ""is"" text to change a rule? For example, if I can make ""baba is key"" or something, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the ""door"" is 1 step to the left. That's probably the win condition. But how to get past the walls? The walls are all aligned to the right. Maybe I need to rearrange the rules. The ""rule `is`"" at 2 steps right and 1 step up could be moved. If I can make ""baba is door"" or ""door is win,"" that might change the win condition. But I need to move those text blocks.

Wait, the ""you"" rule is at 1 step down. If I can make ""you"" apply to another object, like the door, then stepping on it would make me the you, and maybe that's the win. But how to move the ""you"" rule? The ""is"" text blocks can be moved if they're not stopped. Let me check if any objects are stopping movement. The ""stop"" rule is at 1 step left and 4 step up, but that's a wall, so maybe I can't move through there.

I think the key is to move the ""is"" text blocks to create a new rule. For example, if I move the ""is"" at 2 steps right and 1 step up next to ""baba"" and ""win,"" then ""baba is win"" would make reaching Baba the win condition. But where is Baba located? The ""rule `baba`"" is at 2 step left and 1 step down. So if I can make Baba the win, I just need to get to where Baba is. But there's a wall at 3 steps right, so maybe moving that wall's rule?

Alternatively, move the ""you"" rule to the door. If I can place ""you"" next to the door, then stepping on it would make the door the you, and since the default win might still be door, that could work. Let me see the positions. The door is 1 step left. The ""you"" rule is at 1 step down. So maybe move the ""you"" rule to the door's position. But how?

I need to move the ""is"" text blocks to connect the subject and property. For example, take the ""is"" at 7 steps right and 5 step up (top right) and move it next to ""baba"" and ""win"" to make ""baba is win."" But where is Baba located? The ""rule `baba`"" is at 2 step left and 1 step down. So maybe I need to bring the ""is"" block there. If I can move the ""is"" block from 7 steps right to near Baba, then create ""baba is win.""

But how to move the ""is"" blocks? The player (Baba) can move objects that aren't stopped. The ""stop"" rule is at 1 step left and 4 step up, which is a wall, so that area is blocked. The key is at 1 step right and 4 step up, but behind a wall. Maybe I need to move the ""stop"" rule out of the way first. But how? To move the ""stop"" rule, I need to find its text block. The ""rule `stop`"" is at 1 step left and 4 step up. If I can move that ""stop"" rule, perhaps I can remove the stop property from the wall.

Alternatively, create a new rule that makes ""stop"" nothing. For example, ""stop is nothing"" or ""stop is you,"" but I don't have an ""nothing"" object here. Maybe that's not possible.

Another approach: The ""win"" is a door at 1 step left. If I can make the door a ""you"" or ""win,"" then stepping on it would win. The current active rules have ""baba is you,"" so maybe I need to make the door the win. To do that, I need to create a rule ""door is win."" To do that, I need to move the ""is"" text block next to ""door"" and ""win.""

The ""win"" rule is at 8 steps right and 5 step up. The ""door"" is at 1 step left. So the distance is quite far. Maybe there's a closer ""is"" block. The ""is"" at 2 steps right and 1 step up might be movable. If I can move that ""is"" block near the door and the ""win"" rule, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, use the ""is"" at 7 steps right and 5 step up (top right) to create a new rule. If I can bring ""baba"" next to ""win"" with an ""is"" in between, then ""baba is win"" would make winning by reaching Baba.

Baba's position is at the ""rule `baba`"" which is 2 step left and 1 step down. So if I can get to that position, and if ""baba is win,"" then reaching there would win. But the path is blocked by walls. Maybe move the walls by changing their rules. For example, if ""wall is stop"" and I can change that to something else, the walls become passable.

To change ""wall is stop,"" I need to move the ""wall"" rule. The ""rule `wall`"" is at 2 step left and 4 step up. If I can move that ""wall"" rule, perhaps I can redefine it. But to move it, I need to have an ""is"" block nearby to create a new rule. It's a bit tangled.

Another angle: The key is at 1 step right and 4 step up. If I can reach the key, maybe I can use it to unlock something. But there's a wall at 4 steps right and 4 step up. The ""stop"" rule is there, making it immovable. Unless I can remove the ""stop"" property.

Alternatively, maybe the key isn't necessary right now. Let's focus on the immediate goal. The ""door"" is 1 step left. If I can make the door the win by creating ""door is win,"" that would work. To do that, I need to move the ""win"" rule to the door's position or vice versa. But the ""win"" rule is at 8 steps right and 5 step up. That's far away.

Alternatively, use the ""is"" block at 7 steps right and 5 step up. If I can move that ""is"" next to ""door"" and ""win,"" but that's a long distance. Maybe there's a closer ""is"" block. The ""is"" at 2 steps right and 1 step up could be used. If I can move that ""is"" to near the door and the existing ""win"" rule, but the positions are not nearby.

Wait, the current active rules are ""baba is you."" If I can make ""you"" equivalent to ""door,"" then stepping on the door would make me the you, and since the win might still be door, that could work. To make ""you"" a door, I need to create ""door is you."" How?

The ""you"" rule is at 1 step down. So if I can move the ""is"" block next to ""door"" and ""you,"" then ""door is you."" The ""door"" is at 1 step left, and the ""you"" rule is at 1 step down. The ""is"" block at 1 step down (same position as ""you"") could be used. Wait, the ""is"" rule at 1 step down is part of the ""rule `you`"" line. Let me check the objects again.

The objects list includes:
- rule `baba` 2 step to the left and 1 step down
- rule `is` 1 step to the left and 1 step down
- rule `you` 1 step down
- wall 3 steps to the right and 1 step down
- rule `door` 6 steps to the right and 1 step down

So the ""you"" rule is 1 step down, and the ""is"" rule is 1 step to the left and 1 step down. The ""door"" rule is 6 steps to the right and 1 step down.

If I can move the ""is"" block (1 step left, 1 step down) next to ""door"" and ""you,"" then create ""door is you."" But how to position them?

The player is likely at the starting position, which isn't explicitly listed. But based on the objects, Baba is defined by the ""rule `baba`"" at 2 step left and 1 step down. So maybe the player is at that position initially.

From there, to move the ""is"" block at 1 step left and 1 step down, I need to move it right or left. If I move it to the right next to ""you,"" then combining ""door is you"" might not be possible unless the ""door"" is nearby.

Alternatively, move the ""is"" block from 2 steps right and 1 step up (another ""is"" block) to connect ""baba"" and ""win."" Let's see: the ""is"" at 2 steps right and 1 step up. If I move that next to ""baba"" (which is at 2 step left and 1 step down) and ""win"" (8 steps right, 5 step up), that's a bit far.

This is getting complicated. Maybe the simplest way is to move the ""you"" rule to the door. The ""you"" rule is at 1 step down. The door is at 1 step left. So if I can move the ""you"" rule from 1 step down to 1 step left (the door's position), then ""you"" would be at the door, making stepping on it win.

To move the ""you"" rule, I need to move the text block ""you."" Since ""baba is you,"" I can move it. The ""you"" rule is part of the text blocks at 1 step down. The ""is"" rule adjacent to it is at 1 step left and 1 step down. So if I can push the ""you"" block to the left, aligning it with the door.

The door is 1 step left from the starting position (assuming the player is at Baba's position, 2 step left and 1 step down). So moving left from there would reach the door. But there's a wall at 3 steps to the right, so maybe the path is blocked.

Alternatively, use the ""key"" to unlock something, but I'm not sure how. The key is at 1 step right and 4 step up, behind a wall. To get there, I need to move the wall or the stop rule. The ""stop"" rule is at 1 step left and 4 step up, which is a wall. If I can remove the ""stop"" property from that wall, it becomes passable.

To remove ""stop"" from the wall, I need to create a new rule that redefines ""stop."" For example, ""stop is nothing"" or ""stop is you."" But ""nothing"" isn't an object here. Alternatively, move the ""stop"" rule away so it's no longer applying to the wall.

The ""rule `stop`"" is at 1 step left and 4 step up. If I can move that ""stop"" rule to another position, the original wall at 1 step left and 4 step up would lose its ""stop"" property, making it passable. Then I could move the key and use it.

But moving the ""stop"" rule requires having an ""is"" block nearby to create a new rule. The ""is"" block at 7 steps right and 5 step up is too far. The closest ""is"" blocks are at 2 steps right and 1 step up, and 1 step left and 1 step down.

This is getting too complex. Maybe I should try a different approach. Since I'm Baba and ""baba is you,"" I can move any movable objects. The key is at 1 step right and 4 step up. If I can move that key, maybe I can use it on the door. But the door is 1 step left, and the key is 1 step right and 4 step up. The layout is a bit confusing.

Looking at the positions again:

- Door is 1 step left.
- Key is 1 step right, 4 step up.
- Walls are along the right side from steps 2 to 5 up to down.

Maybe the key is behind a stop wall. If I can move the stop rule, the wall becomes passable. Let's focus on that. The ""stop"" rule is at 1 step left and 4 step up. If I can move that ""stop"" rule to another position, say next to the key, then the wall at 1 step left and 4 step up would no longer be stopped, and I could move through.

To move the ""stop"" rule, I need to push it using an ""is"" block. The ""is"" block at 7 steps right and 5 step up is too far. The ""is"" block at 2 steps right and 1 step up might be closer. If I can move that ""is"" block towards the ""stop"" rule, then create a new rule that moves the ""stop"" somewhere else.

Alternatively, destroy the ""stop"" rule by overlapping it with another rule. For example, if I can make ""stop is you,"" then the stop property would apply to ""you,"" which is me, but that might not help.

This is really tricky. Maybe the intended solution is to move the ""you"" rule to the door. To do that, I need to move the ""you"" text block from 1 step down to 1 step left (door's position). Since I'm Baba and can move objects, I can push the ""you"" block left.

The ""you"" rule is at 1 step down. Moving it left would involve stepping on it and moving it left, as long as there's no ""stop"" blocking. The path to the door from ""you"" is leftwards. The ""door"" is at 1 step left, so moving the ""you"" block left by one step would align it with the door.

So the action would be to move left, pushing the ""you"" rule to the door's position. Then, stepping on the door would make me the you, and since the win is the door, that would solve the level.

Therefore, the chosen action is to move left.

The game is Baba Is You, and the active rule is ""baba is you"". The goal is usually to reach the ""win"" object, but I need to check the current rules.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ""door"" located at 7 steps to the right and 1 step down. The key is at 2 steps right and 4 up, but I don't know if it's needed yet. The walls are lining up to the right and up, creating barriers. 

The ""you"" rule is associated with the ""is"" block at 1 step down. So currently, Baba is the subject, and ""you"" is assigned to that. That means I control Baba. The ""win"" is at 9 steps right and 5 up, which is blocked by walls. 

To get to the ""win"", I might need to move the walls or change the rules. The ""stop"" rule is at 4 steps up, so anything defined as stop can't be moved. The ""key"" is nearby, but since I'm Baba, maybe I can pick it up? Wait, in Baba Is You, you can only move objects that aren't stopped. The ""key"" might be movable unless there's a stop rule on it, but I don't see one here. 

Looking at the rule `is` at 3 steps right and 1 step up. If I can move that ""is"" block, I could create new rules. For example, moving ""is"" next to ""baba"" and ""win"" to make ""baba is win"", which would make Baba the win condition. But how to get there?

Baba's position is at 1 step left and 1 step down. So current position is left of the center. I need to move right to reach the ""is"" blocks. The active rules are still ""baba is you"", so I can move around freely unless there's a stop. The walls are to the right and up, but since I'm you, maybe I can push them if they're not stopped. Wait, ""wall is stop"" might be a rule elsewhere. Let me check.

Looking at the objects: there's a ""rule `wall` 2 step to the left and 4 step up"" and ""rule `stop` 1 step to the left and 4 step up"". So that means ""wall is stop"" is a rule. Therefore, walls are stop, meaning I can't push them. So I have to navigate around them.

The key is at 2 steps right and 4 up. If I can reach the key, maybe I need it to unlock something, but I don't see a lock. Alternatively, maybe the key is a distraction. 

The ""door"" at 7 steps right and 1 down might be the exit, but it's blocked by a wall. The rule `door` is at 7 steps right and 1 down. To open the door, maybe I need to change the rule to ""door is open"" or ""baba is door"". But currently, the only active rule is ""baba is you"".

So, the plan: Move towards the ""is"" blocks to create new rules. Since I'm Baba, I can move any text blocks that aren't stopped. The ""is"" blocks are movable unless they're stopped. Checking the objects, there's a ""rule `is`"" at 8 steps right and 5 up (same as the other rules), which is part of the active rules. Since ""is"" is a property here, but unless there's a stop on it, I can move it.

Baba's position is 1 step left and 1 step down. To reach the ""is"" block at 3 steps right and 1 step up, I need to move right twice and up once. But the path is blocked by walls to the right. The walls are at 4 steps right and 5 up, so maybe moving down first? Wait, the current position is 1 left and 1 down. So maybe moving right to get past the walls.

Alternatively, move up to the ""is"" blocks higher up. The ""is"" at 7 steps right and 5 up is part of the active rules. If I can get to that ""is"" block, I could potentially create a new rule like ""baba is win"" by placing ""baba"" next to ""win"" and ""is"".

But navigating there is tricky. The walls are in the way. Let's see. From Baba's position (1 left, 1 down), moving right once would take me to the same column as the wall at 3 steps right. Wait, the walls are at 3 steps right and various ups. So moving right from Baba's position (which is 1 left and 1 down) would be towards positive directions. Let me visualize the grid.

Assuming Baba is at coordinate (0,0):

- Moving right increases the x-coordinate.
- Moving up increases the y-coordinate.

The walls are at x=3, y=5; x=3, y=4; etc. So to the right and up are walls. The ""is"" block at x=8, y=5 is far to the right and up. The ""you"" rule is at x=1 right, y=1 down (relative to Baba's position? Maybe the coordinates are absolute. The problem is that the observations list objects with steps relative to the player's position, but I'm not sure. The exact positions might be tricky without a visual, but I have to work with the text.

Alternatively, focus on the available ""is"" blocks. There's one at 3 steps right and 1 step up. If I can get there, I can move the ""is"" to link ""baba"" with ""win"". But how to reach that ""is""?

Baba's current position: rule `baba` is at 2 step to the left and 1 step down. So relative to the player, Baba is two steps left and one down. Wait, the observation says ""rule `baba` 2 step to the left and 1 step down"". So the player is at position (x, y), and the ""baba"" rule is 2 left and 1 down. So the player is to the right and up of the ""baba"" rule.

To move towards the ""is"" at 3 steps right and 1 step up, the player needs to move right and up. But the path might be blocked by walls. Let's see:

From the player's position (assuming they are at the location of the ""baba"" rule minus 2 left and 1 down), moving right would take them towards the walls. Alternatively, maybe moving down first to get past the walls.

Wait, the player's position is such that the ""baba"" rule is 2 steps left and 1 step down. So if the player is at (x, y), the ""baba"" rule is at (x-2, y-1). The other rules are positioned relative to the player. This is a bit confusing without a map, but I'll have to proceed.

The key is at 2 steps right and 4 up from the player. The ""is"" block at 3 steps right and 1 step up is closer. If the player moves right twice and up once, they can reach that ""is"" block. But the wall at 3 steps right and 4 up is in the way. So maybe move up first to avoid the wall.

Alternatively, move down to get past the wall. The ""is"" block at 3 right and 1 up is below the wall at 3 right and 4 up. So moving down from the player's position might not help. Hmm.

Another approach: Since the ""you"" rule is attached to the ""is"" block at 1 step down, maybe rearrange that to make Baba a different entity. For example, move the ""you"" to Baba, but that's already the case.

The main goal is to reach the ""win"" which is at 9 right and 5 up. To do that, either move the ""win"" rule closer or change the rules so Baba is the win. To change the rules, need to manipulate the ""is"" blocks.

The closest ""is"" block is at 3 right and 1 up. If I can move that ""is"" next to ""baba"" and ""win"", then ""baba is win"" would make the player win. So the steps would be:

1. Move right to reach the ""is"" block at 3 right, 1 up.
2. Drag the ""is"" block to be between ""baba"" and ""win"".
3. Now, ""baba is win"" becomes a rule, so touching the win object wins.

But how to move the ""is"" block. Since the player is Baba, and there's no ""stop"" on ""is"", they can move it. So the action would be to move right towards that ""is"" block.

Alternatively, move up to the higher ""is"" blocks at 7 right and 5 up. But that's far away.

Given the current observations, the immediate ""is"" block at 3 right and 1 up seems more accessible. So the player should move right to reach it. Let's check the possible moves.

From the player's current position, which is relative to the ""baba"" rule at 2 left and 1 down. To reach the ""is"" at 3 right and 1 up, the player needs to move right twice and up once. But the path might be blocked by walls. Let's see the walls:

- wall at 3 right, 5 up
- wall at 3 right, 4 up
- wall at 3 right, 3 up
- wall at 3 right, 2 up
- wall at 3 right, 1 up

So the column x=3 has walls from y=1 up to y=5. The ""is"" block is at x=3, y=1. So the player is trying to move right to x=3, but the wall at y=1 is there. Wait, the ""is"" block is at x=3, y=1, which is a wall? No, the ""is"" is a rule, not a wall. The walls are separate objects. So the player can move into the ""is"" block because it's a text rule, not a wall. But the walls at x=3, y=1 up are obstacles.

So to get to x=3, y=1, the player has to navigate around the walls. Let's see the player's position. The ""baba"" rule is at 2 left and 1 down, so player is at (2, 1) if we consider those as negative directions. To reach x=3, y=1, the player needs to move right twice and stay at the same y. But the wall at x=3, y=1 is present, but it's a wall object, not the ""is"" rule. So the player can move right past the wall? Wait, walls are defined as stop, so the player can't move into them. But the ""is"" block is at x=3, y=1, which is a separate object. So maybe the player can move right twice to x=3, y=1, stepping over the wall? No, because the wall is at x=3, y=1, same as the ""is"" block. So perhaps the ""is"" block is on top of the wall? That might not make sense. In Baba Is You, text blocks can be on top of other objects, but movement is blocked by stop objects.

So if the player is at x=1, y=1 (assuming ""baba"" rule is at x=2 left, which is x=-2 relative to player?), this is getting confusing. Maybe a better approach is to focus on the available moves.

The player's current active rule is ""baba is you"", so they can move freely unless blocked by stop. The walls are stop, so can't move into them. The ""is"" blocks are movable. The key is at 2 right, 4 up. The ""is"" at 3 right, 1 up is a rule that can be moved. To get there, the player needs to move right twice and up zero, but there's a wall at 3 right, 1 up (the wall object). So the player can't move into the wall. Therefore, they need to go around it.

But how? The player's position relative to the wall at 3 right, 1 up. If the player is at, say, (1,1), then moving right to (2,1), then right to (3,1) would hit the wall. So they can't go straight. Maybe move up first? From (1,1) to (1,2), then right to (2,2), then right to (3,2), but there's a wall at 3,2. This seems blocked.

Alternatively, move down from the player's position. The ""is"" block is at 1 step up, so moving up from the player's position would reach the ""is"" block. Wait, the ""is"" is at 1 step up from where? The observation says ""rule `is` 3 steps to the right and 1 step up"". So relative to the player's position, that ""is"" is 3 right and 1 up. So if the player moves up once, they can position themselves to move right towards the ""is"" block, avoiding the walls below.

Let me try to outline a path:

1. Player's current position: Let's assume they are at (0,0) for simplicity.
2. The ""is"" block is at (3,1).
3. Walls are at (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5).
4. The key is at (2,4).
5. The ""you"" rule is at (1, -1) (1 step right and 1 step down from the player?).

To reach (3,1), the player needs to go around the wall at (3,1). Since they can't move into the wall, they have to approach from another direction. For example:

- Move up to (0,1), then right to (1,1), then right to (2,1), then right to (3,1). But (3,1) is a wall. So that doesn't work.
- Move right to (1,0), then up to (1,1), then right to (2,1), then right to (3,1). Again, blocked.
- Move up twice to (0,2), then right to (1,2), then right to (2,2), but there's a wall at (3,2). Can't proceed.

Alternative route: Since the ""is"" block is at (3,1), which is below the walls from (3,2) to (3,5), maybe the player can go around the block from the left. For example:

- Move right to (1,0), then up to (1,1), then right to (2,1), then up to (2,2), then right to (3,2), but there's a wall at (3,2). Still blocked.

This is tricky. Maybe the player needs to move the ""is"" block from a higher position. The ""is"" at 7 steps right and 5 up is part of the active rules. If the player can reach there, they could create a rule like ""baba is win"" by placing ""is"" between ""baba"" and ""win"". But that's far away.

Alternatively, the player can move the ""is"" block at 3 right, 1 up to be next to ""baba"" and ""win"". But how?

""Baba"" is at a different position. The ""baba"" rule is at 2 steps left and 1 step down from the player. So if the player is at (0,0), ""baba"" is at (-2, -1). The ""win"" is at 9 right and 5 up, so (9,5).

To create ""baba is win"", the player needs to move the ""is"" block between ""baba"" and ""win"". That would require moving the ""is"" from (3,1) to somewhere between (-2,-1) and (9,5). That's a long way.

Alternatively, maybe the player can move the ""is"" block to be adjacent to both ""baba"" and ""win"" in one move. For example, if ""baba"" is at (-2,-1) and ""win"" is at (9,5), placing the ""is"" block next to both would require it to be in a position that's adjacent to both, which is impossible unless they are adjacent. So this approach might not work.

Perhaps a better strategy is to first pick up the key. The key is at 2 right, 4 up. If the player can reach it, maybe they need it to unlock the door. But the door is at 7 right, 1 down, blocked by a wall. The rule `door` is there, but without a ""door is open"" rule, it's still a wall.

Alternatively, change the rule for ""door"" to make it passable. For example, ""door is you"" or ""door is stop"". But to do that, the player needs to move the ""is"" block next to ""door"" and the desired property.

The ""is"" block at 7 right and 5 up is part of the active rule ""win is win"" (since ""win"" is at 8 right and 5 up, so the ""is"" is between ""win"" and ""win""? Wait, the active rules are ""baba is you"", and the other rules are probably ""win is win"" and ""wall is stop"", etc., based on the objects listed.

But the player's current active rule is only ""baba is you"". The other rules are listed as objects on the map, like ""rule `win` 8 steps to the right..."", which means those are inactive unless the player manipulates them.

So the player needs to activate new rules by moving ""is"" blocks. For example, moving ""is"" next to ""baba"" and ""key"" to make ""baba is key"", but that doesn't help immediately.

The key is at 2 right, 4 up. If the player gets the key, maybe they can use it elsewhere, but there's no lock mentioned.

Back to the main goal: reach the win object. Since it's blocked by walls, the only way is to change the rules. The most straightforward way is to make Baba the win by creating ""baba is win"".

To do that, the player needs to move an ""is"" block next to ""baba"" and ""win"". The ""win"" is at 9 right, 5 up. The ""baba"" rule is at -2 left, -1 down. The ""is"" blocks are at 7 right,5 up and others.

Let me try to figure out what to do here. The game is Baba Is You, and my goal is to get to the 'win' object, which I think is usually the door or something similar. Looking at the active rules, the only rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I can move around and potentially manipulate other text blocks to change the rules.

First, I need to look at the objects on the map. There are several walls, some 'is' rules, a 'win' rule which is positioned far to the right and up, a 'stop' rule, a key, and a door. The door is at 1 step to the left, but there's a wall 3 steps to the right. Wait, the door's position might be relative to Baba's current position. Let me check the observation again.

Baba's position is at ""1 step to the left and 1 step down."" So if I'm at that position, the door is 1 step to the left from there. But there's a wall 3 steps to the right. Hmm, maybe the walls are blocking paths. The key is at 2 steps to the right and 4 steps up. Not sure if I need the key yet.

The main issue is that the 'win' is far away, at 9 steps right and 5 up. To reach there, I need to move right and up, but there are walls in the way. The 'stop' rule might be making some objects immovable. Since I'm Baba and ""baba is you,"" I can push or move other text blocks unless they're stopped.

Looking at the objects, there are several 'is' rules. If I can move an 'is' rule next to another object, I can create a new rule. For example, if I move 'is' next to 'win', I could make ""win is you"" or something else. But right now, the active rule is only ""baba is you.""

The key is at 2 steps right and 4 up. Maybe I need to get the key first, but how? The path to the key is blocked by walls? Let me visualize the map. The walls are at 4 steps right and various ups. The key is at 2 right and 4 up. So from Baba's position (1 left, 1 down), moving right twice and up four times would reach the key. But are there obstacles? The walls are at 4 steps right, which is further right than the key. So maybe the path is clear.

Wait, but the 'stop' rule is at 4 step up. If I move up, I have to check if any objects are 'stop'. The 'stop' rule is at 4 step up, but what's it attached to? The observation says ""rule `stop` 4 step up."" Does that mean the stop rule itself is at that position, or does it apply to an object there? If the stop rule is at 4 up, then moving into that space might be blocked unless I can change the stop property.

Since I'm Baba and can manipulate rules, maybe I can move the 'stop' rule away. For example, if I move the 'stop' rule to another position, then the object it was stopping might no longer be blocked. Let's see: the 'stop' rule is at 4 step up. If I can move that 'stop' rule somewhere else, maybe the path up becomes clear.

Also, the 'win' rule is at 9 steps right and 5 up. To make Baba have the 'win' property, I could create a rule like ""baba is win"" by moving the 'is' next to 'baba' and 'win'. But right now, the only rule is ""baba is you."" So I need to manipulate other 'is' rules.

Looking at the objects, there's a rule 'is' at 7 steps right and 5 up (same as the 'win' rule's position). If I can move that 'is' down to be next to 'baba', then I could create ""baba is win"". But moving that 'is' block would require it not to be stopped. The 'is' rules themselves—are they movable? Since they are text blocks, and unless they're defined as 'stop', they should be movable.

So the plan might be: move the 'is' block from (7 right, 5 up) to be next to Baba, then combine it with 'baba' and 'win' to make ""baba is win"". That way, Baba becomes the win object, and he can touch the door or the win rule directly.

But how to get to that 'is' block? The 'is' is at 7 steps right and 5 up. From Baba's position (1 left, 1 down), that's quite far. There are walls at 4 steps right, so maybe moving right four steps first, then up? Let's check the path. Moving right from Baba's position (1 left, so actually 0 steps right initially?) Wait, maybe the directions are relative. The observation says ""wall 3 steps to the right and 5 step up"" from Baba's position. So Baba is somewhere, and the walls are positioned relative to him.

Assuming Baba's position is the reference point (0,0), then:

- Wall is 3 right, 5 up.
- 'is' rule is 7 right, 5 up.
- 'win' is 8 right, 5 up.
- 'wall' left 2, up 4.
- 'stop' is at up 4.
- Key is right 2, up 4.
- More walls at right 4, various ups.
- Baba is at left 1, down 1 (so position (-1, -1) if considering Baba as origin).

So to reach the 'is' at (7,5), I need to move right 7 steps and up 5. But there's a wall at (4,4), which is in the way. The 'stop' rule is at (0,4) (since it's 4 steps up from Baba's position). So moving up from Baba's position (0,0) to (0,4) is blocked by 'stop' rule. Unless I can move the 'stop' rule.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a way to bypass the walls by creating new rules. For example, if I can make a path by removing 'stop' properties or creating 'push' rules. But I'm not sure.

Another approach: The door is at 1 step to the left of Baba's position. So if I move left once, I reach the door. But is the door a 'win' object? The active rules still say 'win' is at 8 right,5 up. Unless the door is the win object, but the rule says 'win' is at that position. So maybe the door is just a door that needs to be opened. But how? Maybe by creating a 'key is you' rule to pick it up, but I don't have the key yet.

Wait, the key is at (2,4). From Baba's position (0,0), that's right 2, up 4. But the 'stop' rule is at (0,4), which might block the path up. So moving up 4 steps from Baba would hit the 'stop' rule. Unless I can move the 'stop' rule out of the way.

To move the 'stop' rule, I need to be able to push it. Since 'stop' rule is an object, and unless it's defined as 'stop', I can move it. But the current rules only have 'baba is you'. So the 'stop' rule is just a text block that says 'stop', but since there's no rule defining 'stop' as a property, maybe it's just a movable object. Wait, no. In Baba Is You, the properties like 'stop', 'push', 'you', etc., are defined by the rules. If there's a rule ""X IS STOP"", then X has the stop property and can't be moved. If there's no such rule, then the text block ""STOP"" is just a movable object.

Looking at the active rules: the only rule is ""baba is you"". There's no rule defining 'stop' as a property. So the 'rule `stop` 4 step up' is just a movable text block that says 'stop'. That means I can move it!

So the plan is: move the 'stop' rule away from the path so I can move up. For example, move the 'stop' rule to the right or left. If I can move it, then I can go up past it to get the key.

To move the 'stop' rule, I need to be adjacent to it and move in a direction that pushes it. The 'stop' rule is at (0,4) (4 steps up from Baba's position). So from Baba's position (0,0), moving up 4 steps gets to (0,4), which is the 'stop' rule. Then, if I move up again, I can push the 'stop' rule up to (0,5). But can I do that? In Baba Is You, you can push objects that are not 'stop'. Since there's no rule saying 'stop is stop', the 'stop' rule is just a movable object. So yes, I can push it.

So step by step:

1. Move up 4 times to reach the 'stop' rule at (0,4).
2. Push the 'stop' rule up to (0,5).
3. Now, move up to (0,5) and then right to get to the key at (2,4). Wait, after moving the 'stop' rule up, I'm at (0,5). To get to the key at (2,4), I need to move down to (0,4), but the 'stop' is now at (0,5). Alternatively, move right from (0,5) to (1,5), then (2,5), then down to (2,4). But that might be complicated.

Alternatively, after moving the 'stop' rule up, go down to (0,4), then right to (2,4) where the key is. But there's a wall at (4,4), but the key is at (2,4), which is before the wall. So path from (0,4) to (2,4) is clear.

Once I have the key, maybe I can use it to unlock the door. But the door's position is at 1 step to the left from Baba's original position, which is (-1,0). So if I move left from Baba's position (0,0), I reach the door. But the door is likely a 'stop' object unless there's a rule saying 'door is win'. The active rules have 'rule `door` 6 steps to the right and 1 step down', which is a movable text block. So unless there's a rule like 'door is win', touching the door wouldn't do anything.

So maybe the actual win condition is the 'win' rule at (8,5). To reach there, I need to move right 8 and up 5, but there's a wall at (4,5). Unless I can move the wall. The wall at (4,5) is defined by the 'rule `wall` 1 step to the left and 4 step up'. Wait, the rule 'wall' is at ( -1,4) relative to Baba? Or is the 'rule `wall`' at a certain position. The observation says ""rule `wall` 2 step to the left and 4 step up"". So the 'wall' rule is at (-2,4), which creates a wall where? Maybe the wall is at the position specified by the rule. Wait, in Baba Is You, a rule like ""X IS WALL"" creates a wall at X's position. But here, the rule is ""rule `wall` 2 step to the left and 4 step up"". That's a bit confusing. Maybe it's a text block that says 'wall', which is at that position, but unless there's a rule that makes it a wall, it's just a movable object.

Wait, the active rules are only ""baba is you"". The other rules like ""rule `wall` ..."" are probably just text blocks on the map, not active rules. So the actual walls are created by rules like ""X IS WALL"". But in the current observation, there's no such rule. The only active rule is ""baba is you"". The other 'rule' objects are just text blocks that can be moved.

This is a bit confusing. Let me parse the objects again:

Active rules:
- baba is you

Objects on the map:
- wall 3 steps to the right and 5 step up: This is a wall object at (3,5).
- rule `is` 7 steps to the right and 5 step up: A text block 'is' at (7,5).
- rule `win` 8 steps to the right and 5 step up: Text block 'win' at (8,5).
- rule `wall` 2 step to the left and 4 step up: Text block 'wall' at (-2,4).
- rule `stop` 4 step up: Text block 'stop' at (0,4).
- key 1 step to the right and 4 step up: Key at (1,4).
- wall 4 steps to the right and 4 step up: Wall at (4,4).
- etc.

So the actual walls on the map are the objects labeled 'wall' at (3,5), (4,4), etc. These are created by rules, but since there's no active rule like ""X IS WALL"", they are just regular walls (because in Baba Is You, walls are typically created by ""X IS WALL"" rules, but if such a rule doesn't exist, maybe the wall objects here are placeholders). Wait, no. In Baba Is You, the presence of a wall object on the map usually means there's an implicit rule that makes it a wall. Unless there's a rule like ""WALL IS STOP"" or similar. But in this case, the only active rule is ""baba is you"".

This is getting complicated. Maybe I need to focus on moving the 'is' text block to create a new rule. The goal is to get to the 'win' rule at (8,5), but it's blocked by walls. Alternatively, make Baba into the win object.

To make ""baba is win"", I need to create that rule. The existing 'is' blocks are at (7,5) and (2,1), etc. If I can move the 'is' at (7,5) next to 'baba' and 'win', that would work. But 'baba' is at (-1,-1), 'is' is at (7,5), 'win' is at (8,5). The distance is too far.

Alternatively, use the 'is' at (2,1). That's rule `is` 2 steps to the right and 1 step up from Baba's position. So at (2,1). If I can move that 'is' to be next to 'baba' and 'win', but 'win' is far away.

Alternatively, create a rule like ""you is win"", making whatever is 'you' (Baba) also 'win'. Since the active rule is ""baba is you"", if I can make ""you is win"", then Baba would be win.

To do that, I need to move the 'is' block next to 'you' and 'win'. The 'you' rule is at (1,0) (1 step to the right and 1 step down from Baba's position? Wait, the 'rule `you`' is at ""1 step to the right and 1 step down"". So from Baba's position (0,0), that's (1,-1). The 'win' is at (8,5). The 'is' needed is somewhere in between.

This is getting too complex. Maybe the simplest way is to move the 'stop' rule out of the way, get the key, and then use the key to unlock the door. But how?

Alternatively, push the walls aside. Since the walls are at (3,5) and (4,4), but there's no rule making them 'stop', so they can be moved. Wait, but in the observation, there's a rule 'rule `stop` 4 step up', which is a text block, not a property. So the walls can be moved.

If I can move the wall at (4,4) out of the way, then I can path to the 'win' rule. To move the wall, I need to be adjacent to it and push it. Since there's no 'stop' property on the wall, it can be moved.

So steps:

1. Move right to reach the wall at (4,4). From Baba's position (0,0), move right 4 times to get there.
2. Once next to the wall, move in the direction opposite to where I want to push it. For example, to move the wall left, I would move left while pushing it.
3. After moving the wall, navigate to the 'win' rule at (8,5).

But this requires a lot of steps and might not be feasible. Also, the 'win' rule is far away.

Another angle: The door is at 1 step left from Baba. If I can make the door into the win object, then touching it would win. To do that, create a rule ""door is win"". The 'door' rule is at (6,1) (6 steps right and 1 step down from Baba's position). So to create ""door is win"", I need to move 'is' next to 'door' and 'win'.

The 'is' blocks are at (7,5) and (2,1). The 'win' is at (8,5). The 'door' is at (6,1). It's a bit scattered.

Alternatively, use the 'is' at (7,5) which is near the 'win' rule. If I can move that 'is' down to (7,5) to (6,5), then place it between 'door' (6,1) and 'win' (8,5), but that doesn't make sense.

This is really tricky. Maybe I need to focus on moving the 'is' blocks to create the necessary rules. Let's see:

The 'is' at (7,5) is right next to the 'win' rule at (8,5). If I can move that 'is' down to (7,4), then I could create ""win is you"" by placing 'is' between 'win' and 'you'. The 'you' rule is at (1,0). So from (7,4), moving left to (1,0) is not possible due to distance.

Alternatively, use the 'is' at (2,1). If I move that 'is","

The user is playing Baba Is You and needs help figuring out the next valid action. Let me look at the observation provided.

The active rule is still ""baba is you,"" which means Baba is controllable. The objects on the map include several walls, keys, doors, and rules positioned in different directions. 

The key is 2 steps to the right and 4 steps up from the current position. To get to the key, I need to move right or up. But there are walls in the way. The walls are positioned to the right, up, and down, so movement might be blocked unless there's a way to override them.

The rules are scattered. There's a ""rule `is`"" 8 steps to the right and 5 up, which might be part of a wall or stop rule. The ""win"" rule is far to the right and up, but the door is also there. The ""you"" rule is nearby at 1 step down and to the right of Baba's position. 

Since Baba is ""you,"" moving towards the door might be the goal, but the door is behind a wall. However, maybe I can manipulate the rules. For example, if I can move the ""win"" rule closer or change the door's property. If I can make the door a ""win"" instead of a stop, then reaching it would be the solution.

Looking at the objects, the ""rule `door`"" is 7 steps to the right and 1 step down. If I can push that rule to change the door's property, perhaps to ""win,"" then stepping on the door would make it the win condition. But to do that, I need to move the ""door"" rule text block. 

Baba's position is 1 step to the left and 1 step down from the current location. The ""is"" rule is at 1 step down, and ""you"" is to the right and down. The walls are all to the right, so moving right might hit a wall unless there's a rule allowing it. 

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at 4 steps up. If I can remove that or change it, maybe I can pass through walls. But the ""stop"" is a property, not a text block I can move. The text blocks I can manipulate are the ""is,"" ""win,"" ""wall,"" ""stop,"" ""key,"" and ""door"" rules. 

The closest movable rule is the ""rule `is`"" at 8 steps right and 5 up. But that's far. Alternatively, the ""key"" rule is nearby. Maybe grabbing the key isn't necessary right now. 

The ""rule `you`"" is 1 step to the right and 1 step down. If I can move that to make Baba something else, but since Baba is already ""you,"" maybe combining with another rule. 

Alternatively, pushing the ""door"" rule to change its property. To do that, I need to move the ""door"" text block. The door is at 7 steps right and 1 step down. If I can move that rule to, say, ""win IS DOOR,"" then stepping on the door would win. But how to reach it? 

Baba's position is 1 step left and 1 step down from the current location. To get to the door's rule, I need to move right multiple times. But there's a wall at 4 steps right. However, the ""stop"" rule is at 4 steps up, not directly in the path. 

Wait, looking at the objects again: there's a wall at 4 steps right, 4 steps up. The current path to the right is blocked by walls starting at 4 steps right. So moving right directly might not work. 

Perhaps the solution is to rearrange the ""is"" rule. The ""rule `is`"" at 3 steps right and 1 step up could be moved to create a new rule. For example, making ""door IS WIN"" by moving the ""door"" rule next to ""win."" But the ""win"" rule is at 9 steps right and 5 up, which is far. 

Alternatively, using the existing ""is"" rule at 3 steps right and 1 step up. If I can move that ""is"" rule next to the ""door"" rule, then I could write ""door IS WIN."" But how to get there? 

The current position of Baba is 1 step left and 1 step down. To reach the ""is"" rule at 3 steps right and 1 step up, the path would require moving right, up, avoiding walls. But the walls at 4 steps right might block the way. 

Alternatively, moving the ""you"" rule to make Baba something else. For example, ""BABA IS WIN"" by moving the ""win"" rule next to Baba. But the ""win"" rule is far to the right and up. 

Another angle: the key is at 2 steps right and 4 up. Maybe grabbing the key allows unlocking something, but there's no lock mentioned. 

Given the constraints, the most feasible action might be to move towards the ""is"" rule to manipulate it. But the direction isn't clear. Alternatively, since the previous attempts failed, maybe the correct action is to ""left"" or ""right"" to position near a movable rule. 

Looking at the latest observation, after some failed actions, the current position might have Baba next to a ""is"" rule. The last action was ""right,"" which might have placed Baba near the ""is"" rule at 3 steps right and 1 step up. If I can push that ""is"" rule next to the ""door"" rule, then change the door's property to ""win."" 

But to do that, moving the ""is"" rule to the door's location. The door's rule is at 7 steps right and 1 step down. From the current position (assuming after moving right), maybe moving down towards the door's rule. 

Alternatively, since the active rule is ""baba is you,"" and the user needs to reach the door, perhaps the solution is to push the door rule to make it a win. To do that, move the ""door"" rule text block next to the ""win"" rule. 

But the ""win"" rule is at 9 steps right and 5 up, which is far. The ""door"" rule is at 7 steps right and 1 step down. So moving the door rule up and right. To do that, Baba needs to push it. Since the rule ""door"" is a text block, and if it's not defined as stop, which it isn't (the stop rule is at 4 steps up), then Baba can move it. 

So the action would be to move towards the door rule, push it right or up to reposition it next to the win rule. For example, move right from the current position to reach the door rule, then push it right to align with the win rule. 

But the current observation shows that after several left and right movements, the position might have changed. The latest observation has Baba at 1 step to the left and 1 step down. The door rule is 7 steps right and 1 step down. So from Baba's position, moving right 8 steps would reach the door rule. However, there are walls at 4 steps right, which are stop walls. 

Wait, the walls at 4 steps right are stop? The ""stop"" rule is at 4 steps up, not directly in the path. The walls at 4 steps right in various directions (up, 4 up, 3 up, etc.) are part of the level layout. So moving right past 4 steps might hit a wall that's a stop, preventing movement. 

Therefore, the path to the door rule is blocked by walls. So manipulating the rules is the way to go. 

The key is at 2 steps right and 4 up. Maybe moving towards the key to get a different rule, but not sure. 

Another approach: Since ""baba is you,"" and the goal is usually to reach a ""win"" object. The win is at 9 steps right and 5 up, behind walls. But if I can change the ""win"" rule to be something Baba can push or step on. 

Alternatively, make the door a win by rearranging rules. For that, need to move the ""door"" rule next to the ""win"" rule. But the distance is too great. 

Wait, the ""is"" rule is at 3 steps right and 1 step up. If I can move that ""is"" rule to connect with the ""door"" and ""win"" rules. For example, ""door IS WIN"" by placing ""is"" between them. 

So the steps would be: move to the ""is"" rule at 3 steps right and 1 step up, then move it next to the ""door"" rule and the ""win"" rule. 

But how to move the ""is"" rule? Since Baba can move objects not defined as stop. The ""is"" rule is a text block, and unless there's a stop rule on it, which there isn't, Baba can push it. 

So from Baba's current position (1 step left, 1 step down), move right to reach the ""is"" rule at 3 steps right and 1 step up. The path would be right, right, right, up, up. But there's a wall at 4 steps right, 4 steps up. Moving right past 4 steps would hit a wall that's a stop? 

The walls at 4 steps right in various positions are part of the level layout. The ""stop"" rule is at 4 steps up, which is a different direction. So moving right until step 3, then up to reach the ""is"" rule. 

Once the ""is"" rule is moved next to the ""door"" and ""win"" rules, the rule becomes ""door IS WIN,"" making the door the win condition. Then, moving to the door would win the level. 

But how to execute this in actions? The immediate action needed is to move towards the ""is"" rule. Given the previous failures, perhaps the correct action now is to move ""right"" to get closer to the movable ""is"" rule. 

Alternatively, since the last action was ""right"" and it failed, maybe the correct direction is different. But according to the latest observation, moving right from the current position (1 step left, 1 step down) would bring Baba to the ""baba"" rule at 1 step to the left and 1 step down, which is itself. 

Wait, the objects list has ""rule `baba` 1 step to the left and 1 step down."" So if Baba moves right, he would be at the same position as the ""baba"" rule. Since ""baba is you,"" moving onto the ""baba"" rule doesn't change anything. 

The key is at 2 steps right and 4 up. To get there, need to move right and up, but walls block the path. 

Given the constraints, the most logical action is to try moving ""right"" again to reach the ""is"" rule at 3 steps right and 1 step up. But the wall at 4 steps right might still block. 

Alternatively, move up towards the ""is"" rule at 3 steps right and 1 step up. From current position (1 left, 1 down), moving up would be ""up"" action. 

But the active rules don't change movement; only the position. 

Considering all this, the best action is to move ""right"" to position near the movable ""is"" rule and then manipulate it to change the door's property to ""win.""

Let's try to figure out what to do here. The current active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I can move Baba around. The goal is usually to reach a ""win"" object, but right now, the rules haven't changed that. Looking at the map, I need to get to the ""win"" which is up there among the rules. But there are walls blocking the path. Also, there's a key somewhere. Maybe I need to get the key first to unlock something?

Looking at the objects, the ""key"" is 1 step to the right and 4 steps up from Baba. The walls are forming a sort of barrier. The ""win"" is at 8 steps to the right and 5 steps up. But there's a ""stop"" rule at 4 steps up, which I can't move through. So maybe I need to rearrange the rules to bypass the stop.

The ""is"" rules are scattered. If I can move an ""is"" text block next to another rule, I can change a property. For example, if I make ""baba is win,"" then touching the win object would make me win. But how do I move the text blocks? The rules say I can only move objects that aren't defined as ""STOP"" or similar. The ""is"" rules themselves might be movable unless they're part of a ""STOP"" rule.

Currently, the ""stop"" is a separate rule at 1 step to the left and 4 steps up. So I can move the ""is"" blocks. Let's see. The ""rule `is` 7 steps to the right and 5 step up"" is part of the upper rules. If I can move that ""is"" next to ""baba"" or ""win,"" I can create a new rule. For example, moving an ""is"" to make ""baba is win"" would let me touch the win object. Alternatively, making ""key is you"" so I can pick up the key and carry it.

Wait, right now ""baba is you,"" so I am Baba. If I can move an ""is"" block next to ""key"" and ""you,"" that would make ""key is you,"" meaning I can pick up the key. Then, using the key on a door. But there's a door at 6 steps to the right and 1 step down. However, the path might be blocked. Alternatively, maybe changing ""door is stop"" to ""door is nothing"" so it's passable.

But first, let's check where the ""is"" blocks are. There's one at 7 steps right and 5 up, another at 3 steps right and 1 up, and others. If I move the ""is"" at 7 right,5 up down to be next to ""baba,"" then I can make ""baba is win."" But how to move it? The direction needs to be calculated. The ""is"" is 7 right,5 up from Baba's current position at 2 left,1 down. So Baba is at position (let's assume current position is 0,0), then the ""is"" is at (7,5). To move that ""is"" block, I need to move towards it. But maybe I can use another ""is"" block to push it? Or is there a way to pick up the ""is"" block since it's not a STOP object.

Wait, the rules allow moving text blocks that aren't STOP. So ""is"" itself isn't STOP, so I can move it. So the plan is: move towards the ""is"" block at 7 steps right and 5 up, pick it up, and then place it next to ""baba"" and ""win"" to create ""baba is win.""

But how to navigate there. Baba is currently at 2 step left and 1 step down. The ""is"" is at 7 right,5 up. So from Baba's position, to reach that ""is,"" I need to move right 9 times (since he's 2 left, so to get to 7 right, that's 2+7=9 steps right?), but considering the grid steps. Wait, the observations mention positions relative to Baba. For example, ""wall 4 steps to the right and 5 step up"" from Baba. So Baba's current position is the reference point.

So to move the ""is"" block at 7 right,5 up, which is quite far. But maybe there's a closer ""is"" block. The other ""is"" is at 3 steps right and 1 up. That's closer. If I can move that one. Let's see. If I move that ""is"" block next to ""baba"" and ""win,"" perhaps creating ""baba is win.""

So steps:

1. Move towards the ""is"" block at 3 right,1 up. From Baba's position (2 left,1 down), moving right 3 steps and up 1 step would get to that ""is.""

2. Pick up that ""is"" block and place it next to ""baba"" (which is at 2 left,1 down) and ""win"" which is at 8 right,5 up. Wait, ""win"" is at 9 right and 5 up. So placing the ""is"" between ""baba"" and ""win"" would make ""baba is win.""

But how to position it. If I can move the ""is"" to be adjacent to both ""baba"" and ""win,"" then the rule becomes active. So from the ""is"" at 3 right,1 up, moving it left to be next to Baba. Baba is at 2 left,1 down. So the ""is"" is currently at (3 right,1 up) from Baba. To get it next to Baba, need to move left 3 steps and down 1 step? Wait, directions are relative. If Baba is at 0,0, then the ""is"" is at (3,1). To move it to be adjacent to Baba (0,0), need to move left 3 and down 1, which would place it at (-3,-1), but that's outside the map? Maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the grid is such that moving the ""is"" block to be next to ""baba"" and ""win"" requires placing it in between.

Alternatively, maybe create ""win is you"" so touching the win object makes me win. But since I'm already ""you"" (as per ""baba is you""), maybe that's not necessary. Wait, no. The ""you"" rule is separate. The current rules are ""baba is you,"" so I am Baba, and the ""you"" rule is at 1 step right and 1 step down. Maybe I can move that ""you"" rule to somewhere else.

Alternatively, make ""door is stop"" into ""door is push"" or something, but there's a ""door"" rule at 7 steps right and 1 step down. Not sure.

Another approach: get the key. The key is at 1 step right and 4 up. From Baba's position, that's 3 steps right and 3 up. If I can move there, pick up the key, then use it on the door. But the door is at 6 right and 1 down. So after getting the key, move down to the door and use the key. But how to use the key? In Baba Is You, you push objects by being adjacent and then moving in the direction. So if I have the key (by making ""key is you"" or by picking it up), I might be able to carry it.

Wait, if I make ""key is you,"" then touching the key would make me the key, but since I'm already ""you,"" maybe that allows me to pick it up. Alternatively, if I can move the ""key"" text block next to the ""you"" rule, making ""key is you,"" then I can carry the key.

So steps:

1. Move the ""you"" rule (at 1 right,1 down) next to the key (1 right,4 up). To do that, need to move the ""you"" rule up 3 steps. But can I move the ""you"" rule? Yes, since it's not a STOP rule. So moving the ""you"" rule from (1,1) to (1,4) would place it next to the key. Then the rule becomes ""key is you,"" meaning I can pick up the key.

2. Once I have the key, move to the door (6 right,1 down) and use the key to unlock it. But how? Maybe by pushing the door with the key? Or changing the door's rule to not be stop.

Alternatively, if I make ""door is key,"" then the door requires a key to pass. But I already have the key, so maybe that works. But not sure.

Alternatively, after getting the key, move to the door and push it, but if the door is a STOP, I can't. So perhaps changing ""door is stop"" to ""door is push"" or removing the stop rule.

But there's a ""stop"" rule at 1 left and 4 up. Maybe I can move that ""stop"" rule away to remove the stop property from the wall.

This is getting complicated. Let me focus on the immediate steps. The closest ""is"" block is at 3 right,1 up. If I can move that to make ""baba is win,"" that would directly solve the level.

So from Baba's position (2 left,1 down), the ""is"" is at 3 right,1 up. To get there, I need to move right 3 steps and up 1 step. But each move is one step. So right, right, right, up.

Once I have that ""is"" block, move it next to ""baba"" and ""win."" ""Baba"" is at 2 left,1 down, so to place the ""is"" next to him, move the ""is"" to the left. Wait, if the ""is"" is currently at 3 right,1 up relative to Baba, moving it left would bring it closer to Baba. For example, moving left once would make it 2 right,1 up. Continue moving left until it's adjacent to Baba.

Then, move the ""is"" down to be next to ""win,"" which is at 9 right,5 up. But that's far. Alternatively, place the ""is"" between ""baba"" and ""win"" so the text reads ""baba [is] win.""

Alternatively, since ""win"" is a rule at 9 right,5 up, maybe moving the ""is"" to be between ""baba"" and ""win"" would create the rule. So the plan is:

- Move to the ""is"" block at 3 right,1 up.

- Pick it up and move it left until it's next to ""baba.""

- Then move it up and right to be next to ""win.""

But navigating that might take several moves. Alternatively, since the AI is supposed to output a single action, maybe the best immediate action is to move right towards the ""is"" block.

So the first action would be to move right, then right again, etc., but since the output must be a single action, the best choice now is to move right to get closer to the ""is"" block.

83,Failed to obtain a valid action from the reasoning.,"<reasoning>
I need to figure out how to get to the door and win the level. Let's start by looking at the current active rules. The only rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I can move and manipulate other objects. My goal is usually to reach a ""win"" object, but I remember that rules can change. Let's check the objects on the map.

First, there's a key located 4 steps up. But wait, the key's position is mentioned as ""key 4 step up,"" which might mean it's 4 steps above my current position. However, looking at the other objects, like the walls and doors, I need to see if there's a way to interact with them.

There are several walls arranged to the right and up to 5 steps up. The ""rule `is`"" blocks are scattered around, which are important because rearranging text blocks can change the rules. The ""win"" object is 7 steps to the right and 5 steps up. The ""door"" is 2 steps to the left, which might be the exit, but doors are usually only passable if you have a key or if the rule ""door IS YOU"" or something like that changes.

Looking at the bottom part of the map, there's a ""rule `you`"" 1 step to the left and 1 step down from Baba. Since ""baba is you,"" maybe moving that ""you"" rule to make Baba have another property? Or perhaps moving the ""win"" rule to Baba so that touching him counts as winning.

Wait, the key is 4 steps up. If I can move up there, grab the key, then maybe the door requires a key. But how do I get past the walls? The walls are labeled as ""stop,"" which means I can't push them unless they don't have the stop property. But since I'm Baba and ""baba is you,"" maybe I can move through stop objects? No, wait, ""stop"" means you can't move through them. Unless there's a rule that changes ""stop"" to something else.

Looking at the rule blocks: there's a ""rule `stop` 2 step to the left and 4 step up."" If I can move that ""stop"" rule somewhere else, maybe I can remove the stop property from the walls. Alternatively, create a new rule like ""wall IS stop"" to reinforce it, but that might not help.

Another idea: The ""door"" is 2 steps to the left. If I can make the door a win by moving the ""win"" rule onto it, then touching the door would make me win. But how to get there? The door is blocked by walls, I think. Let me check the positions again.

Baba is at ""rule `baba` 3 step to the left and 1 step down."" So my current position is somewhere, and I need to figure out the layout. The walls are to the right and up. The key is up at 4 steps up. Maybe I need to go up, get the key, then use it on the door. But the door is to the left, which might be blocked by walls.

Alternatively, maybe rearrange the rules. For example, if I can move the ""you"" rule onto Baba, but he's already ""you"" because of ""baba is you."" Wait, the ""rule `you` 1 step to the left and 1 step down"" – if I can move that ""you"" rule onto Baba, maybe that gives him more properties. But how?

Movement-wise, I need to see where I am relative to the key and the door. Let's assume my current position is at the origin (0,0). Then, the key is at (0,4). The door is at (-2,0). The walls are to the right (positive x) and up (positive y). The ""win"" is at (7,5). The ""door"" rule is at (-2,1).

To get to the key, I need to move up four steps. But there are walls at (2,4), (2,3), etc., which are stop. So moving up directly is blocked. Maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule to somewhere else. The ""rule `stop` 2 step to the left and 4 step up"" is at (-2,4). If I can move that ""stop"" rule away, perhaps the walls won't block me anymore. But how to move it? I need to be adjacent to the ""stop"" rule and then move it in a direction, but I have to consider if I can move it past other objects.

Alternatively, create a new rule that makes the walls passable. For example, if I can make ""wall IS push"" or something, but I don't have that rule yet. The existing rules are ""baba is you,"" ""wall is stop,"" ""key is ?,"" ""win is ?,"" etc.

Wait, there's a ""rule `is` 1 step to the right and 1 step up."" That's a generic ""is"" rule block. If I can pick that up and combine it with other rules. For example, take the ""is"" block and combine it with ""key"" and ""win"" to create new rules. But I need to be adjacent to both the ""is"" block and the objects I want to link.

Let me think step by step. My current position is near the lower left part of the map. To reach the key at (0,4), I need to move up, but the walls at (2,4) are stop. So maybe I can move the ""stop"" property from the wall to something else. If I can take the ""stop"" rule and move it to a different object, like the key, making ""key IS stop,"" but that would block the key. Not helpful.

Alternatively, create a rule that says ""wall IS not stop,"" but I don't have that. The only ""is"" blocks are the ones located at various positions. Maybe I can use the ""is"" block at (3 steps to the right and 1 step up) which is rule `is` 4 steps to the right and 1 step up? Wait, in the current observation, the ""rule `is`"" is at 1 step to the right and 1 step up. So if I move to that position, I can pick up the ""is"" rule and then create a new rule.

For example, move to the ""is"" block at (1 right, 1 up), pick it up, then move to the ""wall"" block at (2 right, 4 up) and combine them to create ""wall IS something else."" But I need to see what's available. Alternatively, create ""baba IS win"" so that touching Baba makes me win. But how?

Wait, there's a ""win"" rule at (7,5). If I can move the ""win"" rule onto Baba, then touching him would be winning. But Baba is at (3 left, 1 down). So I need to get to the ""win"" rule, pick it up, and move it to Baba's position.

The path to the win rule is blocked by walls to the right. The walls are at (2,5), (2,4), etc. So maybe I can remove the ""stop"" property from the walls. To do that, I need to move the ""stop"" rule from (-2,4) to somewhere else. For example, move it to the key's position, making ""key IS stop,"" but that doesn't help. Or move it to the wall, but that reinforces stop.

Alternatively, create a new rule that says ""stop IS nothing,"" but I don't have that. Maybe create ""wall IS push,"" allowing me to push walls aside. But I need an ""is"" block to do that.

Another approach: Use the key to unlock the door. The door is at (-2,0), and there's a ""rule `door` 5 steps to the right and 1 step down."" If I can move the ""key"" rule to the door, making ""door IS key,"" then maybe the door can be opened with the key. But I need to have the key first.

So steps could be:

1. Move to the key at (0,4).
2. Pick up the key.
3. Move to the door at (-2,0) and use the key to open it.
4. Enter the door to win.

But how to get past the walls blocking the path to the key. The walls at (2,4) are stop. If I can make those walls passable, then I can move through them. To do that, I need to change their property. For example, create ""wall IS push"" so I can push them aside, but I need the ""is"" block for that.

Alternatively, move the ""stop"" rule from (-2,4) to another object. Suppose I take the ""stop"" rule at (-2,4) and move it to the key's position, making ""key IS stop."" Then the key becomes stop, which blocks movement. Not helpful. Alternatively, move ""stop"" to a different wall, but that doesn't help.

Wait, maybe there's a way to make the walls not stop by redefining their property. For example, if I can create a rule saying ""wall IS not stop,"" but I don't have that. The existing rules are ""wall IS stop"" and ""stop"" is a separate rule. To remove ""stop"" from walls, I need to delete or move the ""stop"" rule that's applied to walls.

Looking at the objects, there's a ""rule `wall` 2 step to the left and 4 step up."" That means ""wall IS whatever is linked to it."" If I can move that ""wall"" rule to a different property, like ""push"" or ""nothing,"" then walls would have a different property.

For example, take the ""wall"" rule at (-2,4) and combine it with an ""is"" block to create ""wall IS push."" Then walls can be pushed, allowing me to move around them. But I need to be adjacent to both the ""wall"" rule and the ""is"" block to create the new rule.

So the plan might be:

1. Move to the ""is"" block at (1 right, 1 up).
2. Pick up the ""is"" block.
3. Move to the ""wall"" rule at (-2,4).
4. Combine them to create ""wall IS push.""
5. Now, walls can be pushed aside.
6. Move up to the key, pushing walls if needed.
7. Grab the key.
8. Move to the door at (-2,0), use the key to open it.
9. Enter the door to win.

But how to execute this step by step. Let's check the current position of Baba. He's at ""rule `baba` 3 step to the left and 1 step down."" So if my current position is, say, (3 left, 1 down), then to get to the ""is"" block at (1 right, 1 up), I need to move right and up. But there are walls to the right. Wait, the walls are at (2 steps to the right and 4 step up), so maybe from Baba's position at (3 left, 1 down), moving right would be towards positive x.

Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should map out the coordinates.

Assuming Baba's position is at (0,0):

- ""rule `baba` 3 step to the left and 1 step down"" would be at (-3, -1).
- The ""is"" block is at (1 right, 1 up) → (1,1).
- The ""wall"" rule is at 2 step to the left and 4 step up → (-2,4).
- The key is at 4 step up → (0,4).
- The door is at 2 step to the left → (-2,0).

So from Baba's position (-3,-1), to reach the ""is"" block at (1,1), I need to move right 4 steps and up 2 steps. But there's a wall at (2,4), which is up there. However, if I can make walls pushable, I can push them out of the way.

But first, I need to get to the ""is"" block. Let's see the path:

From (-3,-1) to (1,1):

Right to 0, then right to 1. Up from -1 to 0, then up to 1. But the way up is blocked by walls starting at (2,4). Wait, the walls are at (2 steps to the right and 4 step up), which is (2,4). So from (0,0) moving up to (0,4) is blocked by the wall at (2,4). But if I can make that wall pushable, I can move it.

Alternatively, go around the walls. But the layout might not allow that.

Alternatively, change the ""stop"" property of the walls. The ""rule `stop`"" is at (-2,4). If I can move that ""stop"" rule to somewhere else, like combining it with the ""key"" to make ""key IS stop,"" but that doesn't help. Or move ""stop"" to a different object.

Wait, the ""rule `stop` 2 step to the left and 4 step up"" is a separate rule. If I can pick that up and move it, I can remove the stop property from the walls. For example, move the ""stop"" rule to the key, making ""key IS stop,"" which would block the key, but that's bad. Or move it to a wall, but that would reinforce stop.

Hmm. Maybe a better approach is to create a new rule that says ""baba IS win,"" so touching Baba makes me win. To do that, I need to move the ""win"" rule onto Baba.

The ""win"" rule is at (7,5). From Baba's position (-3,-1), that's quite far. There are walls to the right, so moving right directly is blocked. But if I can make walls pushable, I can push them aside.

So steps:

1. Get the ""is"" block at (1,1).
2. Use it to create a new rule. For example, combine ""baba"" with ""win"" using ""is"" to make ""baba IS win.""
3. Then, touching Baba would make me win.

But how to reach the ""win"" rule at (7,5). There are walls at (2,4), (2,3), etc. If I can make those walls pushable, I can push them to the side.

To make walls pushable, I need to create ""wall IS push."" To do that, I need the ""wall"" rule and an ""is"" block.

The ""wall"" rule is at (-2,4). So:

1. Move to the ""is"" block at (1,1).
2. Pick it up.
3. Move to the ""wall"" rule at (-2,4).
4. Combine them to create ""wall IS push.""
5. Now, walls can be pushed.
6. Push the walls blocking the path to the ""win"" rule.
7. Move to the ""win"" rule and place it onto Baba.
8. Now, touching Baba wins the game.

Alternatively, once walls are pushable, push them aside to reach the key first, then the door.

But this is getting complicated. Let's try to outline the possible sequence.

First, interact with the ""is"" block to create new rules.

Action: Move right to reach the ""is"" block at (1,1).

But how to move from (-3,-1) to (1,1):

- Move right 4 times: right, right, right, right.
- Move up 2 times: up, up.

But along the way, at x=2, y=0, there's a wall at (2,4) up, but maybe not in the way. Wait, maybe the walls are arranged vertically. For example, from (2,4) down to (2,2). So if I move right to x=2, those walls are above, but I'm moving up to y=1. Maybe I can get past them if I move up first.

Alternatively, move up first. From (-3,-1) move up to (-3,0), then right to (0,0), then up to (0,1), then right to (1,1). But the wall at (2,4) is not in this path. So maybe possible.

Once at (1,1), pick up the ""is"" block.

Next, move to the ""wall"" rule at (-2,4) to create ""wall IS push.""

After that, push the walls blocking the path to the key or the win rule.

Alternatively, create ""baba IS win"" by moving the ""win"" rule onto Baba.

But the key is at (0,4), which is up from Baba's original position. If I can get there, pick up the key, then move to the door at (-2,0) and use the key.

But the door is at (-2,0), which is to the left of Baba's starting position. There's a wall at (2,4) up, but if walls are pushable, maybe push them out of the way.

This is quite complex. The key steps seem to be:

- Manipulate rules to either make Baba the win condition or remove obstacles.
- Either create ""baba IS win"" or find a way to reach the win object while avoiding stops.

Given the time I've spent, I think the most straightforward solution is to create ""baba IS win"" by moving the ""win"" rule onto Baba. To do that, I need to reach the ""win"" rule at (7,5), but the path is blocked. So first, make walls pushable.

So the action sequence would be:

1. Move to the ""is"" block at (1,1).
2. Pick up the ""is"" block.
3. Move to the ""wall"" rule at (-2,4).
4. Create ""wall IS push"" by combining them.
5. Push the walls blocking the path to the ""win"" rule.
6. Move to the ""win"" rule at (7,5) and place it onto Baba's position.
7. Now, touching Baba wins.

But how to execute this in the game. The immediate next action is to move towards the ""is"" block. So the first action should be to move right to get closer.

But in the current observation, the active rules are still ""baba is you,"" and the objects are as listed. The previous actions were left, right, etc., but failed. Now, the latest observation shows Baba at ""rule `baba` 3 step to the left and 1 step down,"" which is (-3, -1) assuming origin.

The ""is"" block is at (1 right, 1 up) from Baba's position. So to get there, need to move right once, then up once.

So the next action should be to move right, then up.

But the output must","

Let's see. The current active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I can move and interact with text blocks. The goal is usually to reach a ""win"" object, but I need to check if that's still the case or if any rules have been changed.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ""door"" at 2 steps to the left and a ""key"" at 4 steps up. Since ""key"" is a movable object (not STOP), I might need to move it to interact with the door. But right now, the key is 4 steps up. Wait, the player (Baba) is at 3 steps to the left and 1 step down. So my position is probably somewhere near there. 

The door is to the left, but there's a wall at 2 steps to the right. Hmm, maybe I need to move the key to the door's location. But how? The key is at 4 steps up. If I move up to get the key, then perhaps carry it down to the door. But I need to check if moving up is possible. The wall at 4 steps up might be a STOP? The rule ""stop"" is at 2 steps to the left and 4 steps up. That wall is a STOP, so I can't push it. 

Wait, the key is at 4 steps up. If I move up twice, I can reach the key. But since there's a STOP wall at 2 steps left and 4 steps up, does that block my path? No, the key is in a different position. Let me visualize the grid. Baba is at (B) 3 left, 1 down. The key is at 4 up. So moving up four times should get me to the key. Once I have the key, I can move it to the door. But the door is at 2 left. So after getting the key, move left twice, then down to the door. But the door is a STOP? Or is it a win condition? The active rule is still ""win"" at 7 right, 5 up. Wait, no, the active rules are only ""baba is you."" The other rules like ""win"" are still present but not active unless redefined. 

Wait, the observation shows active rules as only ""baba is you."" So ""win"" is an object but the current rule for what's a win isn't specified. So maybe the actual win condition is still the default, which is probably the door or the ""win"" text block. But since ""win"" is a separate object, maybe I need to touch it. However, the door is at 2 left, and there's a wall at 2 steps to the right. So maybe the door is across a wall. Alternatively, perhaps I need to change the rule to make the door a win. 

Alternatively, maybe I can push the key to the door. But the key is at 4 up, and the door is at 2 left. So moving left from the key's position would require navigating around walls. Let me check the map again. 

The walls are at 2 right and 5 up, 7 right and 5 up, etc. The key is at 4 up. So moving up from Baba's position (3 left, 1 down) would take me to 4 up. Once there, I can pick up the key. Then move left to the door's location. But there's a wall at 2 steps to the right and 5 up, but that's above. The path to the door (2 left) might be blocked by other walls. 

Alternatively, maybe the solution is to rearrange the rules. For example, make ""key is win"" so that picking up the key makes me win. But to do that, I need to move the ""win"" text block next to the key. The ""win"" is at 7 right, 5 up. So I need to move it left. But to move the ""win"" rule, I have to move the text block, which requires it not to be STOP. The ""stop"" rule is at 2 left and 4 up, which is a different position. So moving the ""win"" rule from 7 right,5 up to near the key might be possible. 

But how to get there? The current position of Baba is 3 left, 1 down. To reach the ""win"" rule at 7 right,5 up, I need to move right 10 times and up 4 times. But there are walls along the way. The walls at 4 right and various up positions might block that path. 

Alternatively, maybe the key isn't necessary. If I can push the ""door"" to be a win. The ""door"" is at 2 left. If I can make ""door is win,"" that would work. To do that, I need to move the ""win"" rule next to the ""door"" rule. The current ""win"" is at 7 right,5 up. So moving it left and down to 2 left's position. But again, navigation is tricky due to walls. 

Another approach: since Baba is ""you,"" maybe I can move the ""is"" text block to create a new rule. For example, moving ""is"" to connect ""baba"" with ""win."" The ""is"" blocks are at 8 right,5 up and 3 right,1 up. If I can move one of these ""is"" blocks next to ""baba"" and ""win,"" that could create a new rule. 

Let me think step by step. 

1. Move up to get the key. From position (B: 3 left, 1 down), move up 4 times to reach 4 up. The key is there. Since there's a wall at 2 left and 4 up (which is a STOP), but the key is at 4 up, so movement should be possible. 

2. After getting the key, move left to reach the door at 2 left. But the path from 4 up to 2 left might be blocked by walls. Looking at the map, there's a wall at 2 right and 5 up, but that's above. At 4 up, the walls are at 4 right,4 up. So from 4 up, moving left would pass through open spaces until reaching the door. 

3. Once at the door, if I can push it, but the door's rule is not specified. If the default is that touching the door wins, but the active rule is only ""baba is you,"" maybe I need to change the rule to make the door a win. 

Alternatively, use the key to unlock the door. But how? In Baba Is You, usually, a key can unlock a door if there's a corresponding rule. But since there's no ""key is unlock"" rule, maybe I need to create one. To do that, I need to move the ""key"" and ""door"" text blocks next to an ""is"" block. 

For example, move the ""key"" next to ""is"" and ""door"" to make ""key is door."" Or ""door is unlock."" But I need to find an ""is"" block to attach them. The available ""is"" blocks are at 8 right,5 up and 3 right,1 up. 

This is getting complicated. Maybe a better approach is to move the ""win"" rule to the door's location. The ""win"" is at 7 right,5 up. If I can move it left to where the door is (2 left), then touching the door would make me win. To move the ""win"" rule, I need to navigate to its position (7 right,5 up) from my current position (3 left,1 down). That's a lot of moves to the right and up, but there are walls in the way. For example, at 4 right and 5 up, there's a wall. So moving right past that would be blocked unless I can push the wall. But the wall is STOP, so I can't. 

Alternatively, maybe I can destroy the wall by changing its rule. For example, move ""stop"" to somewhere else. The ""stop"" rule is at 2 left and 4 up. If I can move that, I could remove the wall. But to move ""stop,"" I need to have it not be STOP. Wait, ""stop"" defines that certain objects are stop. So if I can move the ""stop"" rule, I can remove the immovability. 

So the plan could be: 

1. Move to the ""stop"" rule at 2 left,4 up. 

2. Move the ""stop"" rule away, so the wall at 4 right,5 up is no longer a stop. 

But to do that, I need to navigate to the ""stop"" rule's position. From Baba's position (3 left,1 down), moving left 1 and up 3 would get to 2 left,4 up. Then pick up the ""stop"" rule and move it somewhere else. 

Once ""stop"" is removed, the wall at 4 right,5 up is no longer STOP, so I can push it or move through. Then, I can path to the ""win"" rule and move it to the door. 

This seems feasible. Let's outline the steps: 

- Move left once to 2 left,1 down. 

- Move up three times to reach 2 left,4 up (where ""stop"" is). 

- Pick up ""stop"" and move it, say, down to 2 left,5 up. 

Now, the wall at 4 right,5 up is no longer STOP, so I can move through. 

Then, move right to reach the ""win"" rule at 7 right,5 up. But wait, after moving ""stop,"" the path might be clearer. 

Alternatively, once ""stop"" is moved, go up to 5 up, then right to 7 right,5 up to grab ""win."" Then move left to the door's position (2 left) and place ""win"" there. 

This would make the door the win condition. 

So the sequence would be: 

1. Move left to 2 left,1 down. 

2. Move up to 2 left,4 up (grab ""stop""). 

3. Move down to 2 left,5 up (place ""stop"" elsewhere). 

4. Now, the wall at 4 right,5 up is not STOP. 

5. Move up to 5 up, then right to 7 right,5 up (grab ""win""). 

6. Move left to 2 left (door's position). 

7. Place ""win"" next to the door. 

8. Now, touching the door would make you win. 

Alternatively, after step 6, just stand on the door, which is now a win. 

But this requires precise movement and possibly multiple steps. 

Another angle: Since Baba is ""you,"" maybe I can create a rule like ""door is you"" so that the door becomes controllable. But to do that, I need to move ""is"" next to ""door"" and ""you."" The ""you"" rule is at 1 step right and 1 step down from Baba's current position. 

So, from Baba's position (3 left,1 down): 

- Move right once to 2 left,1 down. 

- Move down to 2 left,2 down (but where is the ""is"" block? The ""is"" blocks are at 8 right,5 up and 3 right,1 up. 

Hmm, this might not be straightforward. 

Alternatively, use the existing ""is"" block at 3 right,1 up. From Baba's position, move right 6 times and up 2 times to reach 3 right,1 up. Then, move the ""is"" block next to ""door"" and ""you."" 

But this involves a lot of movement. 

Given the time constraints and the steps needed, perhaps the most viable path is to remove the ""stop"" rule, then move the ""win"" rule to the door. 

So the actions would be: 

1. left (to 2 left,1 down) 

2. up (to 2 left,2 down) 

Wait, no, the ""stop"" is at 2 left,4 up. So from 3 left,1 down: 

Move left once: 2 left,1 down 

Then up three times: 2 left,4 up (stop) 

Grab stop, move down to 2 left,5 up 

Now, the wall at 4 right,5 up is not STOP. 

Then move up to 5 up, right to 7 right,5 up (win) 

Move left to 2 left (door's position) 

Place win next to door. 

But how to place it? Need to move the ""win"" text block adjacent to the door. 

Assuming the door is at 2 left, then placing ""win"" to the left or right of it. 

This requires precise movement. 

Given that each action is a single step, this would take many actions, but the system expects a single action choice. 

Wait, the user is asking for the next action, not the entire sequence. So I need to choose the best first action. 

Looking at the current position of Baba: 3 step to the left and 1 step down. 

The ""stop"" rule is at 2 left,4 up. So to reach it, the path is left once, up three times. 

But can I move there? From 3 left,1 down: 

Move left to 2 left,1 down. 

Then up three times: 2 left,2 down, 2 left,3 down, 2 left,4 down (but the ""stop"" is at 4 up, not down). Wait, the coordinate system might be inverted. 

In the observations, the positions are given as steps up, right, left, down. So moving up increases the up coordinate, right increases the right coordinate, etc. 

So Baba's position is 3 step to the left and 1 step down. So in grid terms, perhaps (x, y) where left is negative x, right is positive x, up is positive y, down is negative y. 

But the exact coordinate system isn't clear. However, the key is that the ""stop"" rule is at 2 left (x=-2) and 4 up (y=4). 

To get there from Baba's position (x=-3, y=-1), move left once (x=-2, y=-1), then up three times (y=2,3,4). So reach (x=-2, y=4). 

But along the way, are there any obstacles? The wall at 4 right and 5 up is at (x=4, y=5), which is far away. The path from (x=-2, y=4) to grab the ""stop"" rule should be clear. 

Once the ""stop"" rule is moved, the wall at 4 right,5 up is no longer a stop. Then, moving right past it becomes possible. 

So the first action should be to move left once to reach the ""stop"" rule's location. 

Therefore, the chosen action is ""left"".

Let's try to figure out what to do here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I can manipulate the rules. The goal is usually to reach a ""win"" object, but maybe that's changed.

Looking at the objects, there's a door to the left and another one further to the right. The key is up at 4 steps to the right and 4 steps up. But I need to see how to use the rules to get there. 

There's a rule ""is"" at 7 steps to the right and 5 up. Maybe I can move that ""is"" to combine with other rules. For example, if I can make ""baba is win"" or something like that, then touching the door (which might be a win) would work. 

But first, I need to get to the ""is"" rule. The key is up, but moving up might be blocked by walls. Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""baba"" text block to change the rules. The ""you"" rule is at 1 step down from the baba. If I can make ""baba is win,"" then touching the door would win. 

How do I do that? The ""is"" rule is needed to combine subjects and properties. If I can move the ""is"" next to ""baba"" and ""win,"" then I can create ""baba is win."" But the current ""is"" is at 7 steps right, 5 up. The ""win"" is at 8 right, 5 up. So if I move the ""is"" one step left, it would be next to ""win,"" making ""win is"" something, which isn't helpful. Wait, maybe I need to move ""is"" to connect ""baba"" with ""win.""

The ""baba"" rule is at 2 steps left, 1 step down. The ""is"" is at 7 right, 5 up. That's a bit far. Maybe moving left towards the ""is""? Let's see the positions. The agent (Baba) is at 2 left, 1 down. To reach the ""is"" at 7 right, 5 up, that's a lot of steps. But maybe there's a shorter path.

Alternatively, look at the other ""is"" rule at 1 step down. That's closer. If I can move that ""is"" to connect ""baba"" with ""win."" The ""you"" rule is there, so maybe first change ""you"" to something else. Wait, the current rules are ""baba is you,"" so the agent is Baba and can move. 

If I can take the ""is"" at 1 step down and place it between ""baba"" and ""win,"" that would make ""baba is win."" Then touching the door (which is a win) would work. Let's check the positions. The ""is"" is at 1 step down. The ""win"" is at 8 right, 5 up. So moving the ""is"" from 1 down to next to ""baba"" and ""win"" would require moving it up and right. 

But how to move the ""is""? Since I'm Baba, and I can move objects that are not STOP. The ""is"" rule isn't STOP, so I can move it. The ""is"" is 1 step down from the agent's position. If I move down to grab it, then move it up and right to connect to ""baba"" and ""win."" 

So step by step: first, move down to the ""is"" rule. Then, move up to the ""win"" rule, placing the ""is"" between ""baba"" and ""win."" That would create the new rule ""baba is win,"" making the door a win. Then, move to the door and touch it to win. 

But in the current observation, the agent is at ""rule `baba` 2 step to the left and 1 step down."" So the agent's position is probably at coordinates that need to be calculated. The key is at 1 step right and 4 up, but maybe getting the key isn't necessary. 

Another thing: the door is 1 step to the left. If I can make the door a win, then going left would win. To do that, create ""door is win."" But the ""win"" rule is already at 8 right, 5 up. So maybe move the ""win"" rule to the door's location. Alternatively, use the existing ""is"" to link door and win. 

Alternatively, since ""baba is you,"" and if I can make ""win is door,"" then touching the door would be win. But how to arrange that. 

Wait, the active rule is ""baba is you,"" so the agent is Baba. The agent can pick up text blocks (like ""is"") and move them to create new rules. The goal is to rearrange the text blocks to form a rule that makes touching the door a win. 

Looking at the current objects, there's a ""win"" rule at 9 steps right, 5 up. The door is at 1 step left. So maybe the idea is to move the ""win"" rule to the door's position. But how? The agent would have to move the ""win"" rule left, but the path might be blocked by walls. 

Alternatively, create a rule ""door is win"" by placing ""door"" next to ""is"" and ""win."" The door is at 1 step left, and the ""win"" rule is at 9 right, 5 up. The ""is"" rules are at various positions. The closest ""is"" is at 7 steps right, 5 up. That's too far from the door. 

Another approach: since ""baba is you,"" maybe change ""you"" to something else. For example, ""you is win,"" making the agent (Baba) a win. Then touching anything would work, but the door is the target. Alternatively, ""baba is win,"" so touching Baba (himself) would win, but that's not useful. 

Wait, the key is at 1 step right and 4 up. Maybe need to get the key first? But the problem is that moving up might be blocked. The ""stop"" rule is at 4 step up, which means objects there are STOP and can't be moved. So the agent can't move through STOP. 

So the path to the key is likely blocked by walls or STOP. Maybe focus on the door instead. 

The door is at 1 step left. If I can make the door a WIN, then moving left would win. To do that, need to create ""door is win."" The ""win"" rule is at 9 right, 5 up. The ""door"" is at 1 left. The ""is"" rules are at 7 right, 5 up and 1 down. 

So perhaps take the ""is"" at 1 down, move it left to the door's position, then place ""win"" next to it. But the ""win"" is far away. Alternatively, use the ""is"" at 7 right, 5 up. Move that ""is"" left and down to the door area. 

This is getting complicated. Let's try to outline steps:

1. Move to the ""is"" rule at 1 step down (closest one).
2. Pick it up and move left to the door's position.
3. Place the ""is"" next to ""door"" and ""win.""
4. This would create ""door is win,"" making the door a win.

But how to get the ""win"" rule near the door? The ""win"" is at 9 right, 5 up. It's far to the right. Maybe instead, use the existing ""win"" rule and move it left. But can the agent move the ""win"" rule? Yes, unless it's STOP. The ""win"" rule isn't STOP, so the agent can pick it up. 

So steps:

1. Move to the ""is"" at 1 step down.
2. Move to the ""win"" at 9 right, 5 up, pick it up, and move left to the door's position (1 left).
3. Place the ""win"" next to ""door"" and the ""is"" rule.

But the path might be blocked. The agent's current position is 2 left, 1 down. To reach the ""is"" at 1 down, the agent needs to move down once. Then from there, move up to the ""win"" at 9 right, 5 up. That's a lot of steps right and up, but possible. However, there are walls at 4 steps right and up, which are STOP. So moving up past those walls would be impossible. 

Alternative idea: use the ""is"" at 7 right, 5 up. Move that ""is"" down and left to near the door. Then place ""door"" and ""win"" next to it. But the ""door"" is at 1 left, and ""win"" is at 9 right. Not sure. 

Maybe another approach: since ""baba is you,"" and the agent is Baba, if the agent can create a rule that makes ""baba"" a win, then touching himself would win. So create ""baba is win."" The ""win"" rule is at 9 right, 5 up. The ""baba"" text block is at 2 left, 1 down. The ""is"" is at 7 right, 5 up. So the agent would need to move the ""is"" from 7 right,5 up to between ""baba"" and ""win."" 

But the agent's position is 2 left,1 down. To get to the ""is"" at 7 right,5 up, that's a long way. Maybe move right and up, but there are walls at 4 steps right and up which are STOP. So can't pass through them. 

This is tricky. Maybe the solution is to move the ""is"" rule at 1 step down (closer) and create a rule like ""baba is win"" by placing ""is"" between ""baba"" and ""win."" Let's see:

The ""baba"" rule is at 2 left,1 down. The ""is"" is at 1 down (same y-coordinate). So moving down to the ""is,"" pick it up, then move left to ""baba,"" place the ""is,"" then move up to ""win"" at 9 right,5 up. But again, blocked by walls. 

Alternative idea: Use the existing ""you"" rule. The ""you"" is at 1 step to the right and 1 step down. If I make ""you is win,"" then since the agent is you, that would make the agent a win. So create ""you is win."" The ""win"" is at 9 right,5 up. The ""you"" is at 1 right,1 down. The ""is"" is at 1 down. So steps:

1. Move down to the ""is"" at 1 down.
2. Move right to the ""you"" at 1 right,1 down.
3. Place the ""is"" next to ""you"" and ""win.""

But the ""win"" is far away. Maybe instead, use the ""win"" that's already on the map. If I can move the ""you"" next to ""win"" and ""is,"" that would work. 

Alternatively, since the agent is ""baba is you,"" maybe change ""you"" to ""win."" So ""baba is win."" To do that, need to create the rule ""baba is win."" The ""baba"" is at 2 left,1 down. The ""is"" is at 1 down. So move down to the ""is,"" pick it up, move left to ""baba,"" place ""is,"" then move up to ""win."" But again, walls block the path. 

Maybe the key is needed to unlock something, but I don't see a lock. Alternatively, the door might be a win if we can change its property. 

Given the time I've spent, perhaps the correct action is to move left towards the ""is"" at 1 down, pick it up, and place it between ""baba"" and ""win"" to create ""baba is win."" Even if the path is blocked, maybe there's a way around. 

So the agent's current position is rule `baba` 2 step to the left and 1 step down. To get to the ""is"" at 1 step down, the agent needs to move down once. Then move left to the ""baba"" text block, place the ""is,"" then move up to the ""win."" But movement is step by step. 

Alternatively, since the agent is already near the ""is"" at 1 step down, maybe just move left to grab it and place it. 

Wait, the agent's position is ""rule `baba` 2 step to the left and 1 step down."" So the agent is at coordinates (assuming left is negative x, down is negative y): x=-2, y=-1. The ""is"" at 1 step down is at y=-2. So moving down once gets to the ""is."" Then, from there, move left to the ""baba"" rule, which is at x=-2, y=-1 (same as agent's original position?). Hmm, maybe the coordinates are different. 

This is getting too confusing without a visual. But based on the previous steps, the agent needs to manipulate the ""is"" rule to create a new rule that makes touching the door a win. The most feasible way is to create ""door is win."" To do that, need to move the ""is"" next to door and win. 

The door is at 1 step left. The win is at 9 right,5 up. The closest ""is"" is at 7 right,5 up. So move the ""is"" from 7 right,5 up down to the door's area. But that's a lot of steps. 

Alternatively, use the ""is"" at 1 step down. Move it left to the door's position (1 left), then place ""win"" next to it. But the ""win"" is far away. 

Another idea: since the key is at 1 step right and 4 up, maybe pick up the key and use it to unlock something, but I don't see a lock object. 

Alternatively, the solution is to move to the ""is"" rule at 1 step down, pick it up, and place it next to ""baba"" and ""win"" to make ""baba is win."" Even if it's far, perhaps the steps are possible. 

Given the previous failures, maybe the correct action is to move left towards the ""is"" at 1 step down, then proceed to create the new rule. 

So the final action would be to move left to reach the ""is"" rule, then up to place it. But based on the last observation, the agent is already near the ""is"" at 1 step down. Wait, in the current observation, the agent is at ""rule `baba` 2 step to the left and 1 step down."" The ""is"" is at 1 step down, which is one step below the agent. So moving down once would reach the ""is."" Then, move left to the ""baba"" text block (which is at 2 left,1 down), place the ""is"" next to it, then move up to the ""win"" rule. 

But the path might be blocked by walls. However, the key is to figure out the valid action. The immediate action needed is to either move towards the ""is"" or another object. 

Given the previous attempts and failures, perhaps the correct action now is to move down to grab the ""is"" rule, then move left to connect it with ""baba"" and ""win."" 

So the chosen action is to move down once to reach the ""is"" rule.

Let's try to figure out how to solve this Baba Is You level. The user has been moving left, right, etc., but the actions aren't working. The latest observation shows that Baba is at 2 steps to the left and 1 step down. The active rule is still ""baba is you,"" so I can move Baba around.

Looking at the objects, there's a door to the left and another door further to the right. The win condition is ""win"" which is probably one of those doors. But to get there, I might need to move the key first? Wait, the key is at 1 step to the right and 4 steps up. But there are walls blocking the path. Maybe I need to manipulate the rules to make walls passable or move them.

The rules present are ""baba is you,"" ""is"" text blocks, ""wall"" defined as stop, and a ""you"" rule. Since I'm Baba and I can push things that aren't stopped, maybe I can move the ""is"" text blocks to create new rules. For example, if I can move ""is"" next to ""wall"" and ""stop,"" maybe I can change what a wall does. But the walls are all the way up at 5 steps up. How do I reach them?

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule like ""baba is win"" to make myself the win condition. To do that, I need to move the ""win"" text block next to ""baba"" and ""is."" But the ""win"" is 8 steps to the right and 5 steps up. That's quite far. If I can push the ""is"" block over there, then combine it with ""baba"" and ""win."" But moving the ""is"" block requires that it's not stopped. The ""is"" blocks are either at the top or lower parts. The ones at 5 steps up are not stopped, so maybe I can push them.

Wait, the user is currently at 2 steps left and 1 step down. Let's see where the ""is"" blocks are. There's an ""is"" at 1 step down and another at 5 steps up. The ""is"" at 5 steps up is part of the original rules. Maybe I can move that ""is"" block next to ""baba"" and ""win"" to create ""baba is win."" But how to get there?

Alternatively, since I'm Baba and I have the ""you"" rule, maybe I can use that. If I can make ""baba is win,"" then touching the door would make me win. But the doors are separate. There's a door at 1 step left and another at 6 steps right and 1 step down. The door at 1 step left is probably the win condition if ""door is win,"" but that's not the case here. The active rules still have ""win"" as a separate object.

Another approach: The key is at 1 step right and 4 steps up. If I can get the key, maybe I can use it to unlock a door. But the key is blocked by walls. The walls at 4 steps up have a ""stop"" property. Since I'm Baba, and I can push objects that aren't stopped, maybe I can push the walls? But the ""wall is stop"" rule means walls can't be moved. Wait, no—the ""stop"" property means that objects with stop can't be moved. So if I'm Baba (you), can I push a wall? According to the rules, walls are stop, so I can't. Unless I change the rule.

So maybe I need to change the ""wall is stop"" rule. If I can create ""wall is not stop,"" then I could push walls. To do that, I need to rearrange the text blocks to form ""wall is not stop."" That would require moving the ""stop"" text block somewhere else or replacing it.

Looking at the objects, there's a ""stop"" rule at 4 step up (1 step left and 4 step up). If I can move that ""stop"" rule away, then perhaps I can make a new rule. Alternatively, use the ""is"" blocks to create a new rule. For example, if I move ""is"" next to ""wall"" and ""push"" or something else, but I don't see a ""push"" rule here.

Wait, the available text blocks are ""is,"" ""win,"" ""wall,"" ""stop,"" ""key,"" ""door."" The rules are ""baba is you,"" ""is"" in various places, ""wall,"" ""stop,"" ""key,"" ""door."" So maybe I can create a new rule like ""wall is push"" or ""stop is nothing,"" but I need the correct text blocks.

Alternatively, if I can make ""baba is win,"" then touching the win object (which is a door) would make me win. To do that, I need to move the ""win"" text block next to ""baba"" and ""is."" The ""win"" is at 8 steps to the right and 5 steps up. My current position is 2 steps left and 1 step down. It's a bit far, but maybe possible with multiple moves.

Let me map out the positions:

- Baba: 2 step left, 1 step down
- Key: 1 step right, 4 step up
- Doors: 1 step left (door) and 6 steps right, 1 step down (door)
- ""win"" rule: 8 steps right, 5 steps up
- ""is"" rules: several at different positions, including 5 steps up and 1 step down.

So maybe the plan is to move the ""is"" block from 5 steps up to near ""baba"" and ""win."" But how? The ""is"" at 5 steps up is part of the original ""wall is stop"" rule. If I can break that rule by moving ""is"" away, then perhaps create a new rule.

Alternatively, use the ""you"" rule. Since I'm Baba and ""you,"" maybe I can push other objects. But walls are stop, so can't be pushed. Unless I change the rule.

Another angle: The door at 1 step left is a ""door"" object. If I can make ""door is win,"" then touching it would win. To do that, I need to create the rule ""door is win."" The ""win"" is already a separate object, so if I can move ""door"" next to ""is"" and ""win,"" that would work. The ""door"" is at 1 step left. The ""win"" is at 8 steps right, 5 steps up. That's a long distance. Maybe not feasible.

Alternatively, the door at 6 steps right and 1 step down. If I can get there, but it's blocked by walls. The walls are at 3 steps right and various up positions. If I can remove the walls by changing their rules.

Wait, the ""wall is stop"" rule. If I can make ""wall is not stop,"" then I can push the walls aside. To do that, I need to create ""wall is [something else]."" For example, ""wall is you,"" but that might not help. Or ""stop is nothing."" But I don't have a ""nothing"" text block.

Alternatively, use the ""key."" The key is at 1 step right, 4 step up. If I can get the key and use it to unlock a door, but the doors don't seem to be locked; they're just regular doors. In Baba Is You, sometimes doors require a key, but I don't see a ""key is lock"" rule here. So maybe the key isn't needed right now.

Back to the original idea: creating ""baba is win."" To do that, I need to get the ""is"" block next to ""baba"" and ""win."" The ""win"" is up high, but maybe I can move the ""is"" from 5 steps up down to where I am. Let's see:

The ""is"" at 5 steps up is part of the ""wall is stop"" rule. If I can move that ""is"" block down, perhaps I can use it. But how? To move an ""is"" block, I need to push it, but it's not stopped unless it's part of a ""stop"" rule. The ""wall is stop"" makes the wall stop, but the ""is"" itself isn't stopped. So maybe I can push the ""is"" block.

Wait, the ""is"" at 5 steps up is next to ""wall"" and ""stop."" If I can move that ""is"" block away, then the ""wall is stop"" rule breaks, and walls are no longer stop. But I need to do that to maybe push walls later. But first, let's focus on creating ""baba is win.""

So, the steps could be:

1. Move the ""is"" block from 5 steps up to near ""baba"" (2 left, 1 down) and ""win"" (8 right, 5 up). That's a bit tricky.

Alternatively, find a closer ""is"" block. There's an ""is"" at 1 step down. If I can move that ""is"" next to ""baba"" and ""win,"" that would work. Let's see where that ""is"" is. The ""is"" at 1 step down is at 1 step to the left and 1 step down. The ""win"" is at 8 steps right and 5 up. Not close.

Another ""is"" is at 4 steps right and 1 step up. That's closer. Maybe move that ""is"" block to near ""baba"" and ""win.""

But navigating there requires moving through walls. Since walls are stop, I can't push them unless their rules change. This is a catch-22.

Wait, the user is currently at 2 left, 1 down. Let's check the surroundings. To the right is a wall (3 steps right), down is a wall (1 step down), left is the door (1 step left). Up is a wall at 4 steps up. So maybe move up to the key area?

But the key is at 1 right, 4 up. If I can move up and right, but the path is blocked by walls. Unless I change the wall rules.

Alternatively, use the ""you"" rule to interact. Since I'm you, maybe push objects that aren't stop. But walls are stop, so can't push.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at 1 left, 4 up. If I can move that ""stop"" rule away, then walls are no longer stop. Let's see:

The ""stop"" is at 1 left, 4 up. The ""is"" next to it is at 5 steps up. If I can move the ""stop"" rule elsewhere, then walls become movable. For example, move the ""stop"" rule down to where I am.

But to move the ""stop"" rule, I need to push it. Since ""stop"" is a property of the wall, but the ""stop"" rule itself is a text block. The text blocks can be moved if they're not stopped. The ""stop"" rule is at 1 left, 4 up. Is that position stopped? The wall at 4 up is stopped, but the ""stop"" rule is a separate text block. Since there's no rule saying ""stop is stop,"" it's movable.

So, if I can move the ""stop"" rule from 1 left, 4 up to another position, say next to ""wall"" and ""nothing,"" then the ""wall is stop"" rule breaks. Then walls are no longer stop, and I can push them.

So the steps would be:

1. Move the ""stop"" rule (at 1 left, 4 up) to a new position where it doesn't affect the ""wall is stop"" rule. For example, move it next to ""wall"" and ""key"" or something else.

But how to move the ""stop"" rule? The user is at 2 left, 1 down. To reach the ""stop"" rule at 1 left, 4 up, need to move up and left. But the path is blocked by walls. Unless I can push the walls by changing their rules.

This is getting complicated. Maybe another approach: Since I'm Baba and I can create new rules, maybe create ""baba is win"" directly. To do that, I need to have the ""is"" block next to ""baba"" and ""win.""

The ""win"" is at 8 right, 5 up. The ""is"" blocks are at 5 up, 1 step down, etc. It's a long distance. Maybe I can move the ""is"" from 5 up down to near me.

The ""is"" at 5 up is part of the ""wall is stop"" rule. If I can break that rule by moving the ""is"" away, then the wall's stop property is removed. But how?

Alternatively, move the ""is"" from 5 up to next to ""baba"" and ""win."" Let's see the positions:

Baba is at 2 left, 1 down.

""win"" is at 8 right, 5 up.

The ""is"" at 5 up is at 9 right, 5 up (from the initial observation maybe? Wait, the initial observations have varying positions, but in the latest observation, ""rule `is` 7 steps to the right and 5 step up"" — so that ""is"" is at 7 right, 5 up. The ""win"" is at 8 right, 5 up. So the ""is"" is just left of the ""win.""

So if I can move that ""is"" block one step to the right, it would be next to ""win,"" and then I can create ""baba is win"" by placing ""is"" between ""baba"" and ""win.""

But to move the ""is"" block at 7 right, 5 up to 8 right, 5 up (next to ""win""), I need to push it. Since it's a text block, and there's no rule saying it's stop, I can push it.

So the plan is:

1. Move right towards the ""is"" block at 7 right, 5 up.

But the user's current position is 2 left, 1 down. To get to 7 right, 5 up, need to move right multiple times and up.

But the path might be blocked by walls. Let's check the current map.

In the latest observation, the walls are at:

- 5 steps right and 5 up

- 1 step left and 4 up

- 2 steps right and 4 up

- 3 steps right and 4 up, 3 up, 2 up, 1 up

Etc. So moving up from the user's position (2 left, 1 down) would require navigating through walls. Unless the walls are no longer stop.

But the ""wall is stop"" rule is still active. So pushing walls isn't possible unless we remove that rule.

This seems like a dead end. Maybe instead, focus on creating a new rule that makes Baba the win condition.

Another idea: Since there's a ""door"" at 1 step left, and the active rule is ""baba is you,"" maybe touching the door makes me win if the door is the win object. But the door's rule is ""door is door,"" I think. Unless there's a ""door is win"" rule elsewhere. Looking at the active rules, there's no ""door is win,"" so touching the door wouldn't work.

Alternatively, create a ""win is door"" rule. To do that, I need to move the ""win"" block next to ""door"" and ""is."" The ""win"" is at 8 right, 5 up, and the door is at 1 left. That's a far distance, but maybe possible with multiple moves.

But again, the path is blocked by walls. Unless we can move the walls by changing their rules.

This is quite challenging. Maybe the solution is to move the ""is"" block next to ""baba"" and ""win"" to create ""baba is win.""

The user is at 2 left, 1 down. The ""win"" is at 8 right, 5 up. The closest ""is"" block is at 7 right, 5 up. So need to move right 5 times and up 4 times. But each move might be blocked by walls.

Alternatively, look for a shorter path. Maybe move up to 4 right, 1 up where there's an ""is"" block. That ""is"" is at 3 right, 1 up. From there, move right and up towards the ""win"" and ""is"" at 7 right, 5 up.

But again, walls are in the way. This requires figuring out how to navigate around walls by moving them if possible.

Alternatively, use the key. The key is at 1 right, 4 up. If I can get the key and use it to unlock something, but I don't see a lock.

Another approach: Make ""baba is key"" so that picking up the key makes me win. But the win condition is a door, not a key. Unless there's a rule that ""key is win,"" but that's not present.

Wait, the key is at 1 right, 4 up. If I can move the key to the door, but the door is at 1 left. So moving the key left past the walls. But walls are stop, so can't be pushed.

This is really tricky. Maybe the key isn't necessary here. Let's go back to creating ""baba is win.""

The key steps would be:

1. Move to the ""is"" block at 7 right, 5 up.

2. Push it one step to the right next to ""win.""

3. Then, move to where ""baba"" is (2 left, 1 down) and place the ""is"" between ""baba"" and ""win"" to make ""baba is win.""

But how to get to that ""is"" block?

The user's current position is 2 left, 1 down. To reach 7 right, 5 up, need to move right 9 times and up 4 times. But there are walls in the way at various positions.

For example, at 5 right, there's a wall up to 5 up. So moving up from the user's position, at 2 left, 1 down:

- Moving up to 2 left, 2 up: there's a wall.

- Can't move up further because of the wall.

So this path is blocked. Maybe need to move right first to get around the wall.

Move right to 3 left, 1 down. Then up to 3 left, 2 up: there's a wall.

Still blocked. Move right again to 4 left, 1 down. Up to 4 left, 2 up: wall.

This seems like a dead end. The walls are blocking the upward path.

Alternative route: Move down from the user's position. But down is a wall at 1 step down.

Hmm. Maybe","

87,down,"<reasoning>
The goal is to reach the ""win"" object, which is usually a door or a flag. But in Baba Is You, the rules can change. Right now, the active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I can move Baba.

Looking at the map, there's a door to the left. But doors are usually ""stop"" unless there's a rule saying otherwise. Also, there's a key at 1 step right and 4 step up. Maybe I need the key to open the door. But how do I get there?

Let me check the objects again. The key is at 1 step right and 4 step up. From my current position, which seems to be near the ""baba"" rule block at 2 steps left and 1 step down. Wait, the Baba object is at ""rule `baba` 2 step to the left and 1 step down."" So my current position is 2 steps left and 1 step down from that rule block. Maybe I need to move towards the key.

But there are walls blocking the path. The walls are all aligned to the right and up. The key is up and to the right, but there's a wall at 3 steps right and 4 step up. So I can't go straight up. Maybe I need to rearrange the rules to bypass the walls.

The ""rule `is`"" blocks are scattered. If I can move one of them to create a new rule, maybe I can make a path. For example, if I take the ""is"" block at 7 steps right and 5 step up and combine it with ""stop"" or something else. But wait, I need to move text blocks that aren't ""stop"" or similar. The ""stop"" rule is at 1 step left and 4 step up, which I can't move. So maybe I can move the ""is"" block at 2 steps right and 1 step up.

If I move that ""is"" block next to ""wall,"" maybe I can create a new rule like ""wall is stop,"" but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe change ""baba is you"" to ""baba is win,"" making me the win condition. But how?

Wait, the ""win"" rule is at 8 steps right and 5 step up. If I can move that ""win"" rule next to a ""rule `is`"" block, I could potentially make a new rule. Like, if I move ""win"" next to an ""is"" block, maybe it becomes ""something is win."" But I need to have the ""is"" block nearby.

Alternatively, since I'm Baba and can push objects (if they're not stop), maybe I can move the ""is"" blocks around. For example, take the ""is"" at 2 steps right and 1 step up and move it to connect with ""key"" or ""door."" But I'm not sure.

Another idea: the door is at 1 step left. If I can make the door not a stop, maybe I can pass through it. To do that, I need to change the ""door"" rule. There's a ""rule `door` 6 steps to the right and 1 step down."" If I can move that ""door"" rule, maybe I can say ""door is you"" or ""door is win."" But I need to be able to move that rule block. Since it's not a stop, I should be able to push it.

So maybe the plan is: move to the ""door"" rule block at 6 steps right and 1 step down, then reposition it near the actual door to change its property. But how to reach there?

Alternatively, focus on getting the key first. The key is at 1 step right and 4 step up. To get there, I need to move right and up, but the path is blocked by walls. Maybe use the ""is"" block to create a rule that allows movement over walls. For example, if I can make ""wall is stop"" into ""wall is push"" or something, but I don't see a ""push"" rule here.

Wait, the existing rules are ""baba is you,"" ""is"" blocks, ""win,"" ""wall,"" ""stop,"" ""key,"" and ""door."" The ""stop"" rule makes objects unable to be moved. So any object with ""stop"" is immovable. The ""key"" is at 2 step left and 4 step up from the current position? Wait, the key is at 1 step to the right and 4 step up. So from my current position (assuming I'm at the ""baba"" rule's location: 2 step left and 1 step down), moving right once and up four steps would reach the key. But there's a wall at 3 steps right and 4 step up, so I can't go straight there.

Maybe I need to move the wall rules. The ""rule `wall`"" at 2 step left and 4 step up. If I can move that ""wall"" rule, I could change where the walls are. For example, if I make ""wall is stop"" into ""wall is you,"" but that's probably not helpful.

Alternatively, use the ""is"" block at 2 steps right and 1 step up. If I move that ""is"" block next to the ""key"" at 7 steps right and 1 step up, maybe create a new rule. Wait, the ""key"" rule is at 7 steps right and 1 step up. If I move the ""is"" block there and pair it with ""key,"" perhaps making ""key is win,"" but I'm not sure.

This is getting complicated. Let me try to outline possible steps:

1. Move towards the key to get it, but path is blocked by walls.
2. Rearrange rules to remove the wall blocks.
3. Alternatively, change the door's property to not be stop.
4. Or make Baba into the win condition.

Let me focus on changing the door. The door is at 1 step to the left. The ""rule `door`"" is at 6 steps right and 1 step down. If I can move that ""door"" rule next to the actual door, maybe I can change its property. For example, if I make ""door is you,"" then touching the door would make me win. But how to do that?

First, I need to move the ""door"" rule block. It's at 6 steps right and 1 step down. From my current position (2 step left and 1 step down), moving right 6 steps and down 1 step would get to the ""door"" rule. But there are walls in the way. The walls are at 3 steps right and 5 step up, decreasing down each step. So moving right from my position (which is at the ""baba"" rule's location) would hit walls at 3 steps right. So maybe I can't get there directly.

Alternative approach: use the ""is"" blocks to create new rules. For example, take the ""is"" block at 7 steps right and 5 step up and combine it with ""win"" to make ""win is [something]"". But I need to see if that's possible.

Wait, the active rule is ""baba is you."" So I can move around and push objects. Let me see if I can push the ""is"" block at 7 steps right and 5 step up. If I move right, maybe I can reposition it to link with ""win"".

Alternatively, take the ""is"" block at 2 steps right and 1 step up and move it next to the ""key"" at 7 steps right and 1 step up. If I make ""key is win,"" then picking up the key would make me win. But I need to be able to move the ""key"" rule block. The ""key"" rule is at 7 steps right and 1 step up, which is not a stop, so I can move it.

So steps could be:

1. Move to the ""key"" rule block at 7 steps right and 1 step up.
2. Push it next to the key object (1 step right and 4 step up) to create ""key is win"".
3. Then, pick up the key, which would make me win because ""key is win"" and I'm Baba.

But how to reach the ""key"" rule block? From current position, moving right 7 steps and up 1 step would get there, but there are walls blocking the path. Maybe I need to move walls first.

Alternatively, use the ""is"" block at 3 steps right and 1 step up. If I can move that ""is"" block to connect with ""wall"" to change wall properties. For example, make ""wall is push"" so I can push through them. But I'm not sure if that's possible.

This is tricky. Another idea: Since I'm Baba, and the rule is ""baba is you,"" maybe I can move the ""you"" rule to make myself win. The ""you"" rule is at 1 step to the right and 1 step down. If I can move that ""you"" rule next to a ""win"" object, then ""you is win"" would make me win. But the ""win"" is at 8 steps right and 5 step up. Distance is too far.

Alternatively, move the ""you"" rule to where the door is. The door is at 1 step to the left. If I make ""you is door,"" then touching the door would make me win. So steps would be:

1. Move the ""you"" rule block (at 1 step right and 1 step down) to the door's location (1 step left).
2. Then, since I'm ""you,"" touching the door would make me win.

But how to move the ""you"" rule block? It's at 1 step right and 1 step down from my current position. If I move left once and up once, I could reach it. Then push it left to the door's position.

So possible actions:

- Move left to reach the ""you"" rule block.
- Then move left again to push it to the door.
- After that, moving to the door would make me win.

But need to check if the door is a stop. The door's rule is at 6 steps right and 1 step down, which is ""rule `door`"". So unless there's a ""door is stop"" rule, which there is: ""rule `stop` 1 step to the left and 4 step up"" — no, that's a separate rule. Wait, the existing rules are:

- rule `wall` 4 step up
- rule `stop` 1 step to the left and 4 step up
- door 1 step to the left

So the door is at 1 step left, and there's a ""stop"" rule elsewhere. Unless there's a ""door is stop"" rule, which I don't see. So if I can change the door's rule to not be stop, then I can pass through.

Alternatively, if the ""you"" rule is moved to the door, then touching it would make me win. So the plan is:

1. Move to the ""you"" rule block (1 step right and 1 step down).
2. Push it left to the door's location (1 step left).
3. Now, ""you"" is at the door, so touching it makes me win.

But how to move the ""you"" block. From current position (assuming I'm at the ""baba"" rule's location: 2 step left and 1 step down), moving right once and down once would reach the ""you"" rule block at 1 step right and 1 step down. Wait, current position is rule `baba` 2 step to the left and 1 step down. So my position is 2 steps left and 1 step down from the origin? Or is the origin where the map starts? Not sure, but assuming relative positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the best action is to move towards the ""you"" rule block and push it towards the door. But I need to see the exact positions.

Alternatively, since the ""win"" object is at 8 steps right and 5 step up, maybe creating a rule like ""baba is win"" would make me win. To do that, I need to move the ""win"" rule next to an ""is"" block. The ""win"" rule is at 8 steps right and 5 step up. There's an ""is"" block at 7 steps right and 5 step up. If I can move the ""win"" rule one step left to be next to the ""is"" block, then it would become ""is win [something]"". Wait, no. The ""is"" block is a subject, so combining ""is"" with ""win"" and another property. For example, ""win is you"" would make win condition be you. But I'm already you.

Alternatively, ""baba is win"" would make me win. To do that, I need to have a rule ""baba is win"". Since the current rule is ""baba is you"", I need to break that rule and create a new one. To break the rule, I would need to move the ""baba"" text block or the ""you"" text block.

The ""baba"" rule is at 2 step to the left and 1 step down. The ""you"" rule is at 1 step to the right and 1 step down. If I can move either of these, I can change the rule. For example, moving the ""you"" rule next to ""baba"" and ""is"" to make ""baba is you"" into ""baba is win"".

But this requires precise movements. Let's see. The ""is"" block needed is at 7 steps right and 5 step up. The ""baba"" text is at 2 step left and 1 step down. The ""you"" text is at 1 step right and 1 step down. To create ""baba is win"", I need to have ""baba"", ""is"", ""win"" in proximity.

Maybe move the ""win"" rule (at 8 steps right and 5 step up) one step left to be next to the ""is"" block at 7 steps right and 5 step up. Then the rule would become ""is win"", but that's not enough. Need ""baba is win"". So perhaps move the ""baba"" text next to the ""is"" and ""win"" rules.

This is getting too complex. Given the time I've spent and the previous failed attempts, maybe the simplest valid action is to move down towards the ""you"" rule block to position myself better. Or try to move the ""is"" block near the ""win"" to create a new rule.

Let's see. The current active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I can move Baba around. The goal is usually to reach a ""win"" object, but I need to check if that's still the case or if any rules have changed that.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a door to the left. The ""win"" rule is positioned up high, at 8 steps right and 5 up. But there's a wall blocking the path directly up. Also, there's a key at 1 step right and 4 step up. Maybe I need to get the key first to unlock something, but I don't know if there's a lock. 

Baba's current position is 2 steps to the left and 1 step down. So if I move down from there, where would that take me? The ""you"" rule is at 1 step down, so moving down might place me on that rule. Wait, rules are objects too. If I step on a rule, does that affect the active rules? For example, if I step on ""win,"" does that make me win? Or do I need to create a rule that makes Baba equal to win?

Wait, the active rules are still ""baba is you."" So I need to figure out how to reach the door or the win area. The door is to the left, but moving left would take me into a wall at 3 steps to the right. Wait, no, the current position of Baba is 2 steps left and 1 down. If I move left from there, how does that translate? Maybe the coordinates are a bit confusing. Let me parse the positions again.

The map's objects have positions relative to Baba, I think. For example, ""wall 3 steps to the right and 5 step up"" means there's a wall 3 to the right and 5 up from Baba's current position. Similarly, the ""win"" rule is 8 steps right and 5 up. So the way up is blocked by walls. The key is at 1 right and 4 up. Maybe moving up to get the key, then use it to open a door?

But doors are usually stopped unless ""door is not stop"" or something. Looking at the active rules, there's no rule defining door's properties. So doors are likely stoppers. The ""stop"" rule is at 1 left and 4 up. So maybe some objects are stoppers. 

If I can move the ""is"" text block, maybe I can create a new rule. For example, if I take the ""is"" block that's at 2 steps right and 1 step up, and move it next to ""door"" and ""win,"" then maybe make ""door is win."" That way, stepping on the door would make it a win condition. But how to do that?

First, I need to move the ""is"" block. The ""is"" blocks are located at 7 right 5 up, 2 right 1 up, and 1 down. Let's see. The closest ""is"" to Baba's position (2 left, 1 down) is the one at 1 step to the left and 1 step down. That's the ""is"" next to ""you."" If I can move that ""is"" block, perhaps I can combine it with ""door"" and ""win.""

But to move an object, it can't be defined as ""stop"" or similar. The ""stop"" rule is at 1 left 4 up, which is a wall. So the ""is"" blocks are movable unless they're part of a stop rule. Looking at the objects, the ""is"" at 1 down is not blocked. So maybe I can move that ""is"" to the door's position, then make ""door is win.""

So the steps would be: move down to get to the ""is"" block at 1 step down, pick it up, then move to the door's location (1 step left), place the ""is"" there, then write ""door is win."" But how to do that in actions? Each action is a single movement or idle.

Alternatively, maybe move towards the ""is"" block at 2 steps right and 1 step up. From Baba's current position (2 left, 1 down), moving right twice and up once would reach that ""is."" Then, once I have that ""is,"" I can move it to the door's location (1 step left) and place it next to ""door"" and ""win"" to create the new rule.

But navigating through the walls might be tricky. There are walls at 3 steps right 5 up, which is above the key. The key is at 1 right 4 up. So moving up from Baba's position (2 left 1 down) to get to the key would require moving left twice and up four steps. But there's a wall at 3 right 5 up, but that's above, not in the way. The walls below are at 3 right 4 up, 3 right 3 up, etc., which are to the right of Baba's path.

Wait, maybe the key is at 1 step right and 4 step up. So from Baba's position (2 left, 1 down), moving left twice gets to the starting point, then moving right once and up four steps would reach the key. But there's a wall at 3 steps right 4 up, which is to the right and four up. So the path to the key might be blocked by the walls at 3 right 4 up, 3 right 3 up, etc. So maybe I can't get the key directly.

Alternatively, focus on creating a new rule with the existing ""is"" blocks. The ""is"" at 7 right 5 up is up high, but maybe inaccessible. The other ""is"" at 2 right 1 up is closer. Let's think: from Baba's position (2 left 1 down), moving right twice and up once would reach that ""is."" Then, move that ""is"" to the door's position (1 left), so placing it next to ""door"" and ""win"" to make ""door is win.""

So the sequence would be:

1. Move right to get to the ""is"" block at 2 right 1 up.
2. Take the ""is"" block.
3. Move left to the door's location (1 left).
4. Place the ""is"" next to ""door"" and ""win"" to create the new rule.

But how to do this in the allowed actions (up, down, left, right, idle). Each action is a single step. Also, need to ensure that the moved ""is"" is placed adjacent to both ""door"" and ""win"" to form the rule ""door is win.""

Alternatively, maybe the ""is"" block at 1 down (next to ""you"") can be moved. From Baba's position (2 left 1 down), moving down once would place him on the ""is"" block at 1 step left and 1 step down. Then, take that ""is"" and move it to the door's position (1 left) and place it next to ""door"" and ""win.""

So step-by-step:

- Action: down (move to the ""is"" block at 1 left 1 down)
- Then, move left to reach the door's location (but door is 1 step left from Baba's original position)
Wait, Baba's original position is 2 left 1 down. If he moves down, he's at 2 left 1 down + down = 2 left 2 down? No, maybe the coordinates are relative. This is a bit confusing. Let me clarify the positions.

Assuming Baba's position is the starting point. The objects are described as steps relative to him. For example, ""wall 3 steps to the right and 5 step up"" means 3 to the right (east) and 5 up (north) from Baba.

So Baba's initial position is (0,0). The wall at 3 right 5 up is at (3,5). The ""is"" at 7 right 5 up is at (7,5). The ""win"" at 8 right 5 up is at (8,5). The ""wall"" at 2 left 4 up is at (-2,4). The ""stop"" at 1 left 4 up is at (-1,4). The key is at (1,4). Walls continue to the right at (3,4), (3,3), (3,2). The ""is"" at 2 right 1 up is at (2,1). The ""key"" at 7 right 1 up is at (7,1). The door is at (-1,0). The ""baba"" rule is at (-2,-1). The ""is"" at 1 left -1 is at (-1,-1). ""you"" is at (0,-1). The wall at (3,-1) and the ""door"" rule at (5,-1).

So Baba starts at (0,0). His current position is (2 left, 1 down) which would be (-2,-1)? Wait, maybe the description is different. The user's previous observations list Baba's position as ""rule `baba` 2 step to the left and 1 step down."" So that means the ""baba"" text block is 2 left and 1 down from where Baba is. Wait, no, that's confusing. Maybe the objects' positions are relative to Baba's current position. So if the ""baba"" text block is 2 steps left and 1 down, that means it's located at (-2,-1) if Baba is at (0,0).

But this is getting complicated. Let's try to map it out.

Assuming Baba is at position (0,0). The objects are positioned relative to him:

- wall 3 steps to the right and 5 step up: (3,5)
- rule `is` 7 steps to the right and 5 step up: (7,5)
- rule `win` 8 steps to the right and 5 step up: (8,5)
- rule `wall` 2 step to the left and 4 step up: (-2,4)
- rule `stop` 1 step to the left and 4 step up: (-1,4)
- key 1 step to the right and 4 step up: (1,4)
- wall 3 steps to the right and 4 step up: (3,4)
- wall 3 steps to the right and 3 step up: (3,3)
- wall 3 steps to the right and 2 step up: (3,2)
- rule `is` 2 steps to the right and 1 step up: (2,1)
- wall 3 steps to the right and 1 step up: (3,1)
- rule `key` 7 steps to the right and 1 step up: (7,1)
- door 1 step to the left: (-1,0)
- wall 3 steps to the right: (3,0)
- rule `baba` 2 step to the left and 1 step down: (-2,-1)
- rule `is` 1 step to the left and 1 step down: (-1,-1)
- rule `you` 1 step down: (0,-1)
- wall 3 steps to the right and 1 step down: (3,-1)
- rule `door` 6 steps to the right and 1 step down: (6,-1)

So Baba's current position is where? The ""baba"" text block is at (-2,-1), which means that's the position of the ""baba"" rule, not Baba himself. Wait, no. In Baba Is You, the player controls the object that is ""YOU"". So if the rule is ""baba is you"", then Baba is the playable character. So Baba's position is where the ""baba"" text block is located? Or is the ""baba"" text block a separate object that can be moved?

This is a bit confusing. Normally, in Baba Is You, the player moves the object that is designated as ""YOU"". So if the rule is ""baba is you"", then the Baba tile is the one you control. So Baba's position is the position of the Baba tile. But in the observation, the objects listed include ""rule `baba` 2 step to the left and 1 step down"". So that's a text block saying ""BABA IS YOU"", right? Because the format is ""[Subject] IS [Property]"". So ""baba is you"" is a rule, represented as a text block at (-2,-1).

So the actual Baba tile is separate. Wait, maybe the Baba tile is an object that can be moved, and the ""baba is you"" rule means you control that Baba tile. So in the observation, the Baba tile's position is not listed separately, but inferred by the rules. Or perhaps the Baba tile is represented by the ""baba"" text block. This is unclear.

Alternatively, maybe the ""baba"" text block is a rule, and the actual Baba character is a separate object that can be moved. But in the given observation, the objects listed include the ""baba"" rule at (-2,-1), and the ""you"" rule at (0,-1). Since the active rule is ""baba is you"", the playable character is the Baba tile, which is likely located at the position of the ""baba"" rule? Or maybe the Baba tile is a separate object that's part of the level.

This is a bit ambiguous, but given the previous actions, the assistant was moving left, right, etc., so perhaps the Baba tile's position is where the player can move, and the text blocks are separate objects that can be moved to change rules.

In any case, the goal is to reach the ""win"" condition. The current active rule is ""baba is you"", so moving the Baba tile (whatever its position) to the ""win"" area. But the ""win"" is at (8,5), which is blocked by walls at (3,5), (7,5), etc. So direct path is blocked.

Alternatively, create a new rule that makes reaching a door a win condition. For example, ""door is win"". To do that, need to move the ""is"" text block next to ""door"" and ""win"".

Looking at the objects, there's a ""door"" at (-1,0) and a ""win"" at (8,5). The ""is"" blocks are at (7,5), (2,1), (-1,-1), etc. The closest ""is"" to the door is at (7,5), which is up high. To reach there, need to navigate through the walls. But maybe there's a closer ""is"" block.

The ""is"" at (-1,-1) is near the ""you"" rule. If I can move that ""is"" block to the door's location, I can create ""door is win"". But the door is at (-1,0), and the ""win"" is at (8,5). So placing ""is"" between them would require moving it across the map.

Alternatively, use the ""is"" at (2,1). From Baba's current position (assuming he's at (0,0)), moving right to (2,1) where the ""is"" is, then moving that ""is"" to the door at (-1,0). But the path might be blocked by walls at (3,0), (3,-1), etc.

This is getting complicated. Maybe the best approach is to move towards the ""is"" block at (2,1), pick it up, and move it to the door's location. Once there, place it next to ""door"" and ""win"" to create the new rule.

So step-by-step actions:

1. From Baba's position (0,0), move right twice to reach (2,1) where the ""is"" block is.
2. Take the ""is"" block (assuming you can interact by moving onto it).
3. Move left to reach the door's location at (-1,0).
4. Place the ""is"" block next to the door and the win rule. But the win rule is far away at (8,5). This doesn't make sense. Maybe place the ""is"" between door and another object?

Wait, ""door is win"" requires the ""is"" to be between ""door"" and ""win"". But the door is at (-1,0) and win is at (8,5). That's too far apart. Maybe there's a nearby win condition? No, the only win is at (8,5). So this approach might not work.

Alternative idea: Create a rule that makes ""you"" equal to ""win"". Since the active rule is ""baba is you"", if I can make ""baba is win"", then stepping on Baba would make him win. But to do that, I need to move the ""is"" block next to ""baba"" and ""win"".

The ""baba"" rule is at (-2,-1), and ""win"" is at (8,5). The ""is"" blocks are at (7,5), (2,1), (-1,-1). The closest ""is"" to ""baba"" is at (-1,-1). So move from (0,0) to (-1,-1) where the ""is"" is, then move that ""is"" to between ""baba"" and ""win"".

So steps:

1. Move left once to reach (-1,0), but there's a door there. Maybe can't move there.
Wait, the door is at (-1,0), which is a stopper unless there's a rule changing its property. Since the active rules are ""baba is you"", and no rule about door being stop, so door is stop. So moving into door would be blocked.

So to get to the ""is"" at (-1,-1), which is the ""is"" next to ""you"" at (0,-1). From Baba's position (0,0), move down once to (0,-1), which is the ""you"" rule. Then move left to (-1,-1) where the ""is"" is.

Once there, take the ""is"" block, then move up to the ""baba"" rule at (-2,-1), place the ""is"" there, then move right to the ""win"" rule at (8,5). But that's a long distance. Alternatively, place the ""is"" between ""baba"" and ""win"" somehow.

But the ""win"" is up high at (8,5). This seems impractical. Maybe another approach.

Another idea: Use the existing ""win"" rule at (8,5). If I can make ""key is win"", then getting the key would make it a win condition. But there's a ""key"" rule at (7,1). So move the ""is"" block next to ""key"" and ""win"".

The ""is"" at (7,5) is up high. From Baba's position, move right seven","

Let's take a look at this Baba Is You level. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means whatever I move, Baba becomes that object. The goal here is probably to get to the ""win"" condition, which is usually a door or a flag. From the observation, the ""win"" rule is located 8 steps to the right and 5 steps up. There's also a door at 1 step to the left, but I think that's a different door possibly defined by another rule.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key at 1 step to the right and 4 steps up. Maybe I need to get that key first? But how? The walls are blocking the path. The walls are 4 steps to the right and 5 steps up, so perhaps I need to move around them. Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at 4 steps up, which makes those walls immovable. So I can't push them. 

The key is near the upper wall, but there's a ""rule is"" block at 7 steps to the right and 5 steps up. Maybe if I can move that ""is"" block, I could change a rule. For example, if I can make ""key is win,"" then picking up the key would make me win. But to do that, I need to move the ""key"" rule or the ""win"" rule. But right now, the ""win"" rule is fixed 8 steps to the right and 5 steps up. 

Baba's position is at 2 steps to the left and 1 step down. So I'm probably near the bottom left of the map. The ""you"" rule is at 1 step down, so that confirms I'm controlling Baba. To move, I need to go right or down. If I go right, I might hit a wall, but maybe there's a path. Let me check the objects again. 

There's a ""rule is"" at 2 steps to the right and 1 step up. If I can move that ""is"" block, maybe I can combine it with another rule. For example, if I take the ""key"" rule which is at 7 steps to the right and 1 step up, and combine it with ""win,"" then ""key is win"" would make picking up the key allow me to win. But to do that, I need to move the ""key"" rule and the ""win"" rule next to each other. 

Alternatively, maybe I can redefine ""baba"" to be something else. If I can take the ""baba"" text block (which is at 2 steps to the left and 1 step down) and move it to combine with another rule. For instance, if I make ""baba is win,"" then I would turn into the win condition just by standing on it. But how to do that? 

Wait, the ""is"" blocks are movable unless they're part of a STOP rule. The ""stop"" is at 4 steps up, so the walls there can't be moved. But other ""is"" blocks like the ones at 7 right, 5 up (which is part of ""win is..."") and others might be movable. 

Let me think step by step. My current position is 2 left, 1 down. The ""you"" rule is at 1 step down, so that's correct. To reach the ""win"" rule at 8 right, 5 up, I need to go right and up, but there are walls blocking. The walls are at 3 steps right and up to 5 steps, so maybe there's a path around them. 

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" block at 7 right, 5 up. If I can move that ""is"" block down next to the ""key"" rule at 7 right, 1 up, then I could make ""key is win."" But how to move the ""is"" block? The ""is"" block is at 7 right, 5 up. To get there, I need to move right and up. But there's a wall at 4 steps right and 4 steps up. Wait, the walls are at 3 steps right and 5 up, then 4 steps right and 4 up, etc. So perhaps the path is unclear. 

Another approach: since I'm Baba and I can push objects that aren't STOP, maybe I can push the ""is"" blocks to rearrange the rules. For example, if I can take the ""win"" rule (8 right, 5 up) and move it next to the ""key"" rule (7 right, 1 up), but that seems impossible due to the layout. 

Wait, the ""key"" is at 1 right, 4 up. There's a ""rule is"" at 2 right, 1 up. If I can get to that ""is"" block and move it up, maybe I can create a new rule. For example, moving ""is"" to be next to ""key"" and ""win"" somehow. 

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""baba is door"" so that stepping on the door makes me win. The door is at 1 left, so if I can reach it, but there's a wall at 3 right and various positions. 

Hmm, this is tricky. Let me try to visualize the map. The player (Baba) is at 2 left, 1 down. To the right, there are walls starting at 3 right. So moving right directly would hit a wall. But maybe there's a way around by moving up or down first. 

Looking at the upper part, at 5 steps up, there's a wall. The ""win"" rule is at 8 right, 5 up. So maybe that's a platform above the walls. To get there, I need to move right and up, but the walls are in the way. However, the ""is"" block at 7 right, 5 up is part of the ""win"" rule. If I can move that ""is"" block, maybe I can create a new rule elsewhere. 

Wait, the active rule is only ""baba is you."" All other rules are defined by text blocks. So to create a new rule, I need to move two text blocks together. For example, if I move ""key"" next to ""win"" with an ""is"" in between, that would make ""key is win."" 

But how to get the ""is"" block there. The ""is"" block at 7 right, 5 up is part of the ""win"" definition. If I can separate that ""is"" block and move it to another location. Let's see: the ""is"" at 7 right, 5 up is between ""win"" and whatever it's defining. If I move that ""is"" block down to be next to ""key"" and ""win,"" but I need to navigate around the walls. 

Alternatively, maybe I can push the ""is"" block at 2 right, 1 up (which is part of the lower rules) to a different position. For instance, moving it up to connect with the ""key"" rule. But the path might be blocked by walls. 

This is getting complicated. Let's try to outline possible steps:

1. Move right towards the ""key"" to pick it up, but the path is blocked by walls. Maybe need to rearrange rules to make the path clear.

2. Rearrange the ""is"" blocks to create a new rule that changes the win condition or makes Baba into something that can pass through walls.

3. Use the ""you"" rule to ensure that Baba remains the controller.

Since the active rule is ""baba is you,"" I'm already the controller. To win, I need to reach the ""win"" object or change the rule so that something else is win when I touch it. 

Another idea: if I can make ""baba is win,"" then just standing on the win rule would make me win. To do that, I need to move the ""win"" text block next to ""baba"" with an ""is"" in between. But the ""win"" is at 8 right, 5 up, and Baba is at 2 left, 1 down. That's a long distance. 

Alternatively, perhaps I can make ""you is win,"" but I'm already ""you."" So if ""you is win,"" then touching the win rule would make me win. But how to set that up. 

Wait, the current rules are ""baba is you."" So if I can change the ""you"" rule to be ""win,"" then since Baba is you, he would be win. For example, if I move the ""you"" block (which is at 1 step to the right and 1 step down) to be next to ""win"" with an ""is"" in between, making ""you is win."" But the ""you"" block is currently part of the rule ""rule `you` 1 step to the right and 1 step down,"" which is separate from the ""baba is you"" rule. 

So the ""you"" block is a separate text block. If I can move that ""you"" block next to the ""win"" block, connected by an ""is,"" then the rule would be ""you is win,"" making Baba (as you) win upon touching anything that's win. 

But how to get there. The ""you"" block is at 1 right, 1 down. The ""win"" block is at 8 right, 5 up. There's a long way around. Maybe I need to move the ""is"" blocks to create the necessary connections. 

Alternatively, focus on moving the ""key"" first. If I can get the key, maybe there's a rule that requires it. But the key is at 1 right, 4 up. To reach it, I need to move right and up, but there's a wall at 3 right, 4 up. So perhaps I can push the wall? But the wall is defined as ""stop,"" so I can't move it. 

This is really challenging. Maybe the solution is to move the ""is"" block at 2 right, 1 up (which is part of the lower rules) to connect with the ""key"" and ""win"" blocks. Let's see: if I can move that ""is"" block up next to the ""key"" at 1 right, 4 up, then create ""key is win."" But how to navigate there. 

Baba's current position is 2 left, 1 down. To reach the ""is"" block at 2 right, 1 up, I need to move right twice and up once. But moving right from the current position (assuming starting at 0,0), right twice would take me to 2 right, and up once to 1 up. But is there a wall there? Looking at the map, at 3 steps right and up to 5 steps, there are walls, but at 2 right, 1 up, there's a ""rule is"" block. So maybe that's open. 

So moving right twice and up once would get me to the ""is"" block at 2 right, 1 up. Then, if I can move that ""is"" block up to connect with the ""key"" at 1 right, 4 up. But how? The ""is"" block is at 2 right, 1 up. To get to the key's position (1 right, 4 up), I need to move left and up. But that might be possible. 

Alternatively, move the ""is"" block to the right and up to connect with the ""key"" and ""win."" But this requires precise movements. 

Another angle: the door is at 1 left. If I can make ""baba is door,"" then stepping on the door would make me win. The door's rule is at 6 steps to the right and 1 step down. So if I can move the ""door"" text block next to ""baba"" with an ""is,"" that could work. 

But the ""door"" block is at 6 right, 1 down. Baba is at 2 left, 1 down. So the distance is significant. 

Hmm. Maybe the key is a red herring. The main goal is to reach the ""win"" rule. Since ""win"" is at 8 right, 5 up, perhaps the intended solution is to rearrange the rules to make Baba into the win condition. 

If I can take the ""win"" rule and combine it with ""baba"" using an ""is"" block. For example, moving the ""is"" block at 7 right, 5 up (which is part of the ""win"" rule) and moving it to be between ""baba"" and ""win."" But ""baba"" is at 2 left, 1 down, and ""win"" is at 8 right, 5 up. It's a far distance, but maybe possible by moving through the map. 

Alternatively, use the existing ""is"" blocks to create a new rule. For instance, moving the ""is"" block at 2 right, 1 up to connect ""baba"" with ""win."" But again, the distance is an issue. 

Wait, maybe there's a shorter path. If I can move the ""is"" block at 7 right, 5 up (part of the ""win"" rule) down to a lower position. For example, moving it down to 7 right, 4 up, then to 7 right, 3 up, etc., until it's next to ""baba."" But that seems tedious and might not be feasible due to walls. 

Alternatively, think about the ""stop"" walls. Since they're immovable, I have to find a path around them. The walls start at 3 right, so maybe moving left from there. But Baba is at 2 left, 1 down. Moving right from there, but the walls at 3 right block the way. 

Wait, the initial position of Baba is 2 step to the left and 1 step down. So in terms of coordinates, maybe it's better to think in relative terms. Let's assume Baba is at position (0,0). Then:

- ""wall 3 steps to the right and 5 step up"" would be at (3,5).
- ""rule `is` 7 steps to the right and 5 step up"" is at (7,5).
- ""key 1 step to the right and 4 step up"" is at (1,4).
- ""rule `baba` 2 step to the left and 1 step down"" is at (-2, -1).

Wait, this might be a better way to visualize. So Baba starts at (0,0). The ""baba"" text block is at (-2, -1), which is 2 steps left and 1 down from Baba's position. That makes sense because the rule ""baba is you"" is defined by that text block located at (-2, -1).

The ""win"" rule is at (8,5). To reach there, I need to move right 8 and up 5, but there are walls starting at (3,4) upwards. So the path is blocked. 

The ""key"" is at (1,4), which is to the right and up from Baba. But moving there would require navigating past the walls at (3,4) and above. 

The ""is"" blocks are key here. The ""is"" at (7,5) is part of the ""win"" rule. If I can move that ""is"" block down to, say, (7,4), then maybe I can connect it with the ""key"" at (1,4) and another ""is"" to make ""key is win."" But how to get there.

Alternatively, take the ""is"" block at (2,1) (which is part of the lower rules) and move it up to connect with ""key"" and ""win."" 

But this requires moving through the map. Let's think step by step:

1. From Baba's position (0,0), the ""baba"" text block is at (-2,-1). To interact with it, I need to be adjacent.

2. The ""is"" block at (2,1) is to the right and up. Moving right twice and up once from (0,0) gets me there.

3. If I pick up that ""is"" block and move it up to (2,2), then maybe connect it with the ""key"" at (1,4). But there's a wall at (3,4), so maybe not.

Alternatively, move the ""is"" block at (2,1) to the left to (1,1), then up to (1,2), etc., towards the ""key"" at (1,4). But there's a wall at (3,4) upwards, so perhaps not.

This is really tough. Maybe the solution is to move the ""win"" rule itself. The ""win"" rule is at (8,5). If I can move that rule down to a lower position, maybe next to ""baba,"" then I could create ""baba is win."" But moving a rule requires moving its ""is"" block. The ""is"" block for ""win"" is at (7,5). If I can move that ""is"" block to be between ""baba"" and ""win,"" like at (-2,-1) [baba] + moved ""is"" to (-1,-1) and ""win"" to (0,-1), but that's speculative.

Alternatively, since ""baba is you,"" and if I can make ""you is win,"" then since Baba is you, he becomes win. To do that, I need to create the rule ""you is win."" The existing ""you"" block is at (1,0) [assuming relative positions], and ""win"" is at (8,5). So I need to move the ""you"" block and ""win"" block with an ""is"" in between. 

This seems complicated. Another angle: perhaps push the door at ( -1, 0) by making ""door is push"" or something, but there's no such rule. 

Wait, the door is at 1 step to the left, which in coordinates would be (-1,0). If I can make ""baba is door,"" then stepping on the door would make me win. The door's rule is at (6,1). So I need to move the ""door"" text block to be next to ""baba"" with an ""is"" in between. 

But the distance is too great. Maybe there's a shorter path. Alternatively, use the existing ""is"" blocks to link ""baba"" with ""door."" 

Alternatively, make ""win is door,"" so touching the door makes me win. That would require moving the ""win"" rule to be next to ""door"" with an ""is."" 

The ""win"" is at (8,5), ""door"" at (-1,0). Not adjacent. 

This level is really challenging. Maybe the intended solution is to move the ""is"" block at (7,5) (part of ""win"") down to (7,4), then","

I need to figure out how to solve this Baba Is You level based on the current observation. Let me start by parsing the information given.

The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means that whatever I do, I can potentially move or manipulate other objects by moving text blocks. The goal is usually to reach a ""win"" object, but that might change if I can alter the rules.

Looking at the objects on the map:

- There are several walls arranged to the right and up from my current position.
- A ""key"" is located 1 step to the right and 4 steps up. Maybe I need to get the key to unlock something?
- A ""door"" is 1 step to the left. But doors are usually win conditions if you can reach them, but here it's positioned such that moving left might lead to it. However, there's a wall to the right that might block my path.
- The ""rule `you`"" is 1 step down. Since I'm Baba and ""baba is you,"" maybe I can move that ""you"" rule to somewhere else to change my properties?
- There's a ""rule `win`"" up high, but it's blocked by walls. Maybe I need to rearrange the rules to make ""baba is win"" instead?

Wait, the active rules only show ""baba is you."" All other rules like ""win,"" ""key,"" ""wall,"" etc., are separate text blocks. To change a rule, I need to move these text blocks. For example, if I can move the ""win"" rule to where I am, then ""baba is win"" would make me the win condition.

But how do I get to the ""win"" rule? It's 8 steps to the right and 5 steps up, but there are walls in the way. Maybe I need to move some of the ""is"" rules to create a path?

Looking at the ""is"" rules: there are several ""rule `is`"" blocks. If I can move an ""is"" next to the ""win"" block, I can make a new rule like ""baba is win."" But to do that, I need to push the ""is"" block there. However, movement is restricted by ""stop"" properties. The ""stop"" rule is at 4 steps up, 1 step to the left. So anything defined as ""stop"" can't be moved. But the ""is"" rules might not be stopped unless they are part of a ""stop"" rule.

Wait, the current active rules only have ""baba is you."" So other objects like ""is,"" ""win,"" etc., are not stopped. That means I can potentially move them. Let me check the objects again.

The ""stop"" rule is at 1 step to the left and 4 steps up. So that specific tile is stopped. But the ""is"" rules are at different positions. For example, there's a ""rule `is`"" at 7 steps right and 5 steps up, which is where the ""win"" rule is located. So if I can move that ""is"" block next to the ""baba"" text, I could create a new rule.

But where is the original ""baba"" text? The observation mentions ""rule `baba`"" at 2 steps to the left and 1 step down. So that's the Baba object. If I can move the ""is"" block next to it and then append ""win"" or another property, I can change the rules.

Alternatively, since I'm Baba and ""baba is you,"" I can move any text blocks that aren't stopped. The key here might be to rearrange the ""is"" blocks to form new rules. For example, moving an ""is"" next to ""baba"" and then next to ""win"" to make ""baba is win,"" which would make me the win condition.

Looking at the positions:

- ""rule `is`"" is at 7 steps right and 5 steps up. The ""win"" rule is at 8 steps right and 5 steps up. If I can move that ""is"" block one step to the right, it would be next to ""win,"" forming ""is win,"" but that's not a valid rule. Wait, the rules are formed as ""[Subject] IS [Property]"". So the ""is"" needs to be between the subject and the property. So if I can move the ""is"" block between ""baba"" and ""win,"" then the rule would be ""baba is win.""

The original ""baba"" rule is at 2 steps left and 1 step down. The ""win"" rule is at 8 steps right and 5 steps up. The ""is"" rule is at 7 steps right and 5 steps up. So if I can move that ""is"" block one step to the right, it would be adjacent to ""win,"" but not adjacent to ""baba."" Alternatively, maybe there's another ""is"" block lower down.

There's another ""rule `is`"" at 2 steps right and 1 step up. That's closer to the Baba's position. If I can move that ""is"" block next to the ""baba"" rule and then next to the ""win"" rule, I could create the desired rule.

But how do I get there? My current position isn't clear, but the objects are relative. Let's assume I'm positioned near the ""baba"" rule at 2 steps left and 1 step down. To move the ""is"" at 2 steps right and 1 step up, I need to go up and right. But there are walls blocking the path up. The walls are at 4 steps right and up to 5 steps up. So maybe I need to find a way around them.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the key to unlock something. The key is at 1 step right and 4 steps up. If I can get the key, perhaps there's a locked door, but the door is at 1 step left, which is close. However, moving left from my current position might be possible if there's no wall. But the wall at 3 steps right and 1 step down might be my current position. Wait, the walls are consistently at 3 steps right except for some higher up.

This is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to visualize the map based on the observations.

Assuming the player (Baba) is at the position of the ""rule `baba`"" object, which is 2 steps left and 1 step down. So the player's current location is somewhere, and the ""baba"" text is 2 steps left and 1 step down from that. Wait, no—the ""rule `baba`"" is an object on the map, which is a text block saying ""baba"". The player is Baba, so their position is where the Baba icon is, which is separate from the text blocks. But in Baba Is You, the player's character is the same as the ""BABA"" text block if ""baba is you"" is active.

Wait, no. The player controls the character which is Baba, and the text blocks are separate. So the ""BABA"" text block is an object on the grid, and if the rule is ""baba is you,"" then touching or moving that text block allows you to manipulate it. But usually, you move your character (Baba) around, and if you can push text blocks, you can rearrange the rules.

So in this case, the player is Baba, and they can move around, pushing objects that aren't stopped. The goal is to reach the door or change the rules to make themselves the win condition.

Given that the active rule is ""baba is you,"" the player can move any objects that aren't stopped. The ""stop"" rule is at 1 step left and 4 steps up, so that tile is immovable.

The key is at 1 step right and 4 steps up. To get there, the player would need to move right and up, but there's a wall at 3 steps right and 4 steps up. So maybe they can't reach the key directly. Unless there's a way to move the wall or remove the stop rule.

Alternatively, the key might not be necessary if there's another way to reach the win condition.

The ""win"" rule is at 8 steps right and 5 steps up, but it's blocked by walls. The ""is"" rule is at 7 steps right and 5 steps up, next to the ""win"" rule. So if the player can move that ""is"" rule one step to the right, adjacent to ""win,"" and also adjacent to ""baba,"" then they can form the rule ""baba is win.""

But how to get the ""is"" rule to both positions? The ""is"" rule at 7 steps right and 5 steps up is already next to ""win."" If the player can move another ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" and then append ""win,"" that could work.

There's another ""is"" rule at 2 steps right and 1 step up. If the player can move this ""is"" block next to the ""baba"" rule (which is at 2 steps left and 1 step down), then place the ""win"" rule next to it, forming ""baba is win.""

But the positions are a bit tricky. Let's map this out:

- ""rule `baba`"" is at 2 steps left and 1 step down from the player's current position (assuming the player is at 0,0).
- ""rule `is`"" is at 2 steps right and 1 step up from the player's position.
- ""rule `win`"" is at 8 steps right and 5 steps up.

So the player needs to move the ""is"" at 2 steps right and 1 step up to be next to the ""baba"" rule. Then, move the ""win"" rule to be next to that ""is"" rule.

But to do that, the player would need to navigate through the grid, avoiding walls. The walls are at 3 steps right and up to 5 steps, which might block the path upwards.

Alternatively, maybe the player can push the ""is"" block from its current position (2 right, 1 up) to the left, towards the ""baba"" rule. But the ""baba"" rule is at 2 left and 1 down, which is in the opposite direction. So moving the ""is"" block left would take it further away from the ""baba"" rule.

Wait, perhaps the player is positioned between the ""baba"" rule and the other objects. Let me try to sketch a possible layout:

Assume the player is at (0,0).

- ""rule `baba`"" is at (-2, -1).
- ""rule `is`"" is at (2, 1).
- ""rule `win`"" is at (8,5).
- Walls are at (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), and also at (-1,4) and (1,4) for the ""stop"" rule.

So the player needs to move from (0,0) to interact with the ""is"" block at (2,1), then move it towards (-2,-1) to form ""baba is win"". But the path from (0,0) to (2,1) is blocked by walls at (3,5) up, but maybe not in that direction. Wait, the walls are at 3 steps right and various ups. So from (0,0), moving right to (2,1) is possible if there's no wall in between. The walls are at (3,5) and below, but not necessarily at (2,1). So the player can move right and up to reach (2,1).

Once at (2,1), the player can push the ""is"" block. Since there's no ""stop"" rule there, they can move it left or up. To form ""baba is win"", they need to place ""is"" between ""baba"" and ""win"". So moving the ""is"" from (2,1) to (-2,-1) next to ""baba"" isn't feasible because of distance. Alternatively, moving the ""is"" next to ""win"" and then next to ""baba"".

Alternatively, there's another ""is"" block at (7,5), next to ""win"". If the player can move that ""is"" block to the left, adjacent to ""baba"", then they can form ""baba is win"". But ""baba"" is at (-2,-1), which is far from (7,5). So that's not practical.

Another approach: Since the player is Baba and ""baba is you"", they can move any movable object. The ""key"" is at (1,4). If the player can get the key and use it to unlock a door, but the door is at (-1,0) (1 step left). However, there's a wall at (3,right), so moving left from the player's position might be possible if there's no wall in the way.

Wait, the door is 1 step to the left, but the player's position isn't clear. Let me assume the player is at (0,0), and the door is at (-1,0). There's a wall at (3,5) and others, but moving left from (0,0) to (-1,0) might be possible if there's no wall there. The observation lists a wall at 3 steps right and 1 step down, which is (3,-1) if the player is at (0,0). So moving left to (-1,0) should be possible if there's no wall there. The door is at (-1,0), which is a win condition if you can reach it. But how?

If the door is a win condition, then reaching it would solve the level. But the door is at 1 step left, which is adjacent to the player's assumed position (0,0). So moving left once would reach the door. But why hasn't the player done that before?

Wait, looking back at previous actions, the user tried moving right, left, down, etc., but the game defaulted to idle because the actions weren't valid. Maybe the path to the door is blocked by a wall.

The observation shows a wall at 3 steps right and 1 step down, which if the player is at (0,0), that's (3,-1). But moving left to (-1,0) is adjacent and not blocked by a wall unless there's one there. The listed walls are at (3,5), (3,4), etc., which are far to the right. So perhaps moving left from (0,0) to (-1,0) (the door) is possible, and since the door is a win condition, that would solve the level.

But why didn't the previous actions include moving left? Maybe the user made a mistake in previous steps. Alternatively, the door might be behind a stop rule or another obstacle.

Looking at the active rules, the only rule is ""baba is you"". The door is a separate object. If there's no rule making the door blocked, then reaching it should work. So the solution might simply be to move left to reach the door.

But in previous steps, the assistant tried moving right, left, down, etc., but the actions failed. Perhaps the movement is restricted because of the way the grid is set up. For example, maybe the player can't move left directly because there's a wall in that direction, even though it's not listed.

Wait, the listed walls are at specific positions. For example, ""wall 3 steps to the right and 5 step up"" would be at (3,5). The player's position isn't specified, but if they're trying to move left to (-1,0), and there's no wall listed at (-1,0), then it should be possible.

Alternatively, the door might be behind a stop rule. The ""stop"" rule is at 1 step to the left and 4 step up, which is (-1,4). That's far from the door at (-1,0), so it shouldn't block the path to the door.

Therefore, the simplest solution might be to move left once to reach the door, which is a win condition. However, in previous actions, the assistant didn't choose left, maybe because of a miscalculation.

Wait, looking at the latest observation, the door is 1 step to the left. So the correct action should be ""left"".

Let's try to figure out what to do here. The current active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means whatever I do, I can manipulate the rules. The goal is usually to reach a ""win"" object, but maybe that's changed here.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a door to the left, which might be the win condition. But there's also a key nearby. Maybe I need to get the key first? Let's check the positions.

Baba is located 1 step to the left and 1 step down from my current position. Wait, no—the observation says ""rule `baba` 1 step to the left and 1 step down."" So that's where the Baba text block is. To move Baba, I need to move that text block. But the active rule is ""baba is you,"" so I can move Baba by moving the ""baba"" rule.

Looking at the other rules: there's an ""is"" rule at 7 steps to the right and 5 steps up. If I can move the ""is"" rule next to another text block, I can create a new rule. For example, if I move ""is"" next to ""key,"" it could make ""key is you"" or something else. But first, I need to reach those text blocks.

The walls are blocking direct paths. Let me see the obstacles. There's a wall 4 steps to the right and various positions up. The key is at 2 steps to the right and 4 steps up. If I go right twice and up four times, I could reach the key. But the path might be blocked by walls. Let me map it out.

From my current position (assuming Baba is at 1 step left and 1 step down from where I am?), moving right might get me closer. Wait, the exact positions are a bit confusing. The objects are listed with their directions relative to me. For example, ""wall 4 steps to the right and 5 step up"" is a wall that's far away. The ""is"" rule is 8 steps right and 5 up, which is even further. The key is 2 right, 4 up. So maybe I need to prioritize moving towards the key to get it, then use it to open a door.

But how do I move the ""key"" rule? Since ""baba is you,"" I can move any object that's not stopped. The ""stop"" rule is at 4 steps up, so objects below that might be movable. The key is at 2 right, 4 up. If I can move down to reach it, but there's a wall at 4 steps right and 4 up. Maybe I need to find a way around.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule like ""key is win"" to make the key the win condition. To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to ""key"" and ""win."" But the ""win"" rule is 9 steps right and 5 up, which is far. Alternatively, create ""you is key"" so that touching the key makes me you, but I already am you.

Wait, the active rule is ""baba is you,"" so I'm Baba. If I can make ""key is win,"" then touching the key would make it a win. Let's see. The ""key"" rule is at 8 steps right and 1 step up. The ""win"" rule is at 9 right, 5 up. If I can move the ""is"" rule to connect them, but that's a long distance. Maybe there's another way.

Alternatively, move the ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" and ""win"" to make ""baba is win."" Then touching Baba would make me win. But I'm already Baba and you, so that might work. But where is the ""baba"" rule? It's at 1 step left and 1 step down. If I can move the ""is"" rule there and replace the existing ""baba is you"" with ""baba is win,"" that could make touching Baba the win condition. But how to do that.

Wait, the current active rules are only ""baba is you."" To change that, I need to move the ""is"" rule. Let's see, the ""is"" rule is at 8 steps right and 5 up. If I can move that ""is"" rule next to the ""baba"" rule and the ""win"" rule, I can create a new rule. But moving the ""is"" rule would require navigating through walls. The path to the ""is"" rule is blocked by walls 4 steps right and various up positions. Maybe I need to go around them.

Alternatively, since I'm Baba (you), maybe I can push the walls if they are not stopped. The ""stop"" rule is at 4 steps up, so walls below that might be movable. The walls at 4 steps right and 4 up are stopped? No, the ""stop"" rule is at 4 step up, but the wall is at 4 steps right and 4 up. Wait, the ""stop"" rule's position isn't clear. The observation says ""rule `stop` 4 step up."" So the stop rule is directly above, 4 steps up from me. That means any object under that stop rule might be immovable. So the walls above the stop rule (like at 4 steps right and 5 up) are stopped, but ones below might be movable.

So, to move the ""is"" rule at 8 right and 5 up, it's blocked by stopped walls. Maybe I need to find another way. Let's focus on the door to the left. If I can make the door a win, then reaching it would win. To do that, I need to create ""door is win."" The ""door"" rule is at 7 steps right and 1 step down. The ""win"" rule is at 9 right and 5 up. So moving the ""is"" rule between them. But again, distance is an issue.

Alternatively, use the key. If I can get the key, maybe there's a door that requires it. The key is at 1 right and 4 up. If I move right twice and up four times, but there's a wall at 4 right and 4 up. Wait, the wall is at 4 right and 4 up, so maybe I need to go around. Alternatively, push the wall if it's not stopped. The wall at 4 right and 4 up: is it stopped? The ""stop"" rule is at 4 step up, but the wall's position is 4 right and 4 up. So the stop rule is in a different direction. Maybe that wall isn't stopped. If I can move past it by pushing, since I'm you (Baba), and the rule is ""baba is you,"" which allows movement unless blocked by stop.

But the wall is at 4 right and 4 up. If I'm trying to go right, maybe I need to move down first. Let's see, current position has Baba at 1 left and 1 down. So maybe I'm at position (0,0), and the key is at (2,4). The walls are at (4,5), (8,5), etc. The ""is"" rule is at (8,5). To get to the key at (2,4), I need to move right twice and up four times. But the path might be blocked by walls at (4,4) and others. Let me visualize:

My position: Let's assume I'm at (0,0).

Baba's position: 1 left and 1 down from me would be (-1, -1). But the ""rule `baba`"" is at 1 step left and 1 step down from me, so that's (-1, -1).

Key is at 2 right and 4 up: (2,4).

Walls at 4 right and 4 up: (4,4).

So moving from (0,0) to (2,4) requires going right twice, up four. But there's a wall at (4,4), but I'm at (2,4) which is before that. So maybe the wall at (4,4) is further ahead. So the path to the key is possible if there's no wall between (0,0) and (2,4). Let's check other walls:

There's a wall at 4 steps right and 5 up: (4,5). That's above the key. So moving up from (0,0) to (2,4) would pass through (2,4), then (2,5), but the wall at (4,5) is further right. So maybe the path is clear.

But how do I move? Since I'm you (Baba), I can move unless stopped. The ""stop"" rule is at 4 step up, which is (0,4). So any object at (x,4) is stopped. The wall at (4,4) is at y=4, so it's stopped. So I can't push that wall. But the key is at (2,4), which is also at y=4. Is that wall stopped? The ""stop"" rule is a separate object; the wall's position is (4,4), so it's stopped. But the key is at (2,4), which is not stopped because the stop rule is a different object. Wait, the stop rule is a text block that makes objects it's attached to be stopped. So if there's a ""stop"" rule at (0,4), does that stop objects at (4,4)? Or does each ""stop"" apply to objects it's connected to?

In Baba Is You, a ""STOP"" property typically applies to the object it's directly attached to. So the ""stop"" rule at (0,4) would make whatever it's connected to be stopped. If the wall at (4,4) is connected to the ""stop"" rule, then it's stopped. But if they're separate, then the wall might not be stopped. The observation says ""rule `stop` 4 step up,"" which is at (0,4). The wall at (4,4) is separate, so unless connected by a rule, it's not stopped. So I can move past the wall at (4,4) if I'm not pushing it, but if I need to go around.

But the key is at (2,4), which is below the stop rule. Since I'm you, I can move there unless blocked by a stopped object. The wall at (4,4) is stopped, but it's to the right of the key. So to get to the key at (2,4), I can move right to (1,0), (2,0), then up to (2,4). Let's see:

Move right to (1,0), right to (2,0), up to (2,1), up to (2,2), up to (2,3), up to (2,4) which is the key. But along the way, are there any walls? The walls are at (4,5), (8,5), etc., and at (4,4). So moving up from (2,0) to (2,4) is clear except for the wall at (4,4), which is to the right. So yes, I can reach the key.

Once I have the key, maybe I can use it on a door. The door is 1 step to the left, which is (-1,0). But how? If I have the key, maybe I can move to the door and use the key. But in Baba Is You, using a key usually involves pressing it on a door. So if the door is at (-1,0), and I have the key, I need to move next to the door and press it. But how to do that when the door's rule is ""door is door"" unless changed.

Alternatively, create a rule like ""key is win"" so that picking up the key makes me win. To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to ""key"" and ""win"". The ""win"" rule is at (9,5), which is far away. Maybe not feasible.

Alternatively, create ""you is key"" so that touching the key makes me you (but I already am you), or ""key is you"" to become key. If I become key, then maybe I can walk over the door without a key. But the goal is usually to reach the door, which might require the key if it's locked.

Wait, the door's rule is ""door is door"", which means it's a door. Unless there's a rule like ""key unlock door"", which there isn't here. So maybe the door is always a door, requiring a key to open. But in the current rules, there's no such rule. So perhaps the key is a red herring, and the actual solution is different.

Looking back, the active rule is ""baba is you"". The other rules are ""is"", ""win"", ""wall"", ""stop"", ""key"", and ""door"". Maybe the solution is to change the ""win"" condition to Baba. For example, create ""baba is win"" by moving the ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" and ""win"". The ""baba"" rule is at (-1,-1) relative to me, and the ""win"" rule is at (9,5). The ""is"" rule is at (8,5). So to create ""baba is win"", I need to move the ""is"" rule from (8,5) to between ""baba"" and ""win"". That would require moving left and down, but there are walls in the way.

Alternatively, use the ""is"" rule at (8,5) to create a new rule by combining it with other text blocks. For example, move the ""is"" to next to ""key"" and ""win"" to make ""key is win"". Then picking up the key would make it a win. But again, the distance is a problem.

Another approach: since I'm Baba and you, maybe I can push the ""is"" rule. The ""is"" rule is at (8,5). To move it, I need to move right or up/down. But there are walls at (4,5) and others. Maybe move down from (8,5) to (8,4), but is that possible? The path might be blocked.

Alternatively, focus on the ""door"" at (-1,0). If I can make the door a win, then reaching it would win. To do that, create ""door is win"" using the ""is"" rule. The ""door"" rule is at (-1,0), and ""win"" is at (9,5). The ""is"" rule is at (8,5). So moving the ""is"" from (8,5) to between ""door"" and ""win"" would require moving left and down, which is possible if the path is clear.

But moving from (8,5) to (-1,0) is a long way. There are walls at (4,5), (8,5) is the ""is"" rule. Moving left from (8,5) to (7,5), (6,5), etc., but there's a wall at (4,5). So can't go that way. Maybe move down from (8,5) to (8,4), then left to (7,4), etc., but are there walls? The observation shows walls at various positions but not specifically in that path. It's possible that the path is clear, but I'm not sure.

This is getting complicated. Maybe the simplest solution is to move towards the ""is"" rule at (8,5) and use it to create a new rule. For example, move ""is"" next to ""baba"" and ""win"" to make ""baba is win"". But how to reach that position.

Alternatively, since I'm at (0,0), and the ""is"" rule is at (8,5), maybe move right and up step by step. But there are walls at (4,5) and others. This might not be feasible.

Wait, the key is at (2,4). If I can get the key and then move to the door at (-1,0), perhaps there's a way to use the key there. But without a rule that says ""key opens door"", it might not work. However, in some levels, just touching the door with the key in inventory wins. But I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Alternatively, create a rule like ""key is you"" so that becoming key allows me to pass through doors. Then pick up the key and move to the door. Let's see: to make ""key is you"", I need to move the ""is"" rule next to ""key"" and ""you"". The ""you"" rule is at (1, -1) (1 step to the right and 1 step down from me). The ""key"" rule is at (8,1). The ""is"" rule is at (8,5). So moving the ""is"" from (8,5) to between ""key"" (8,1) and ""you"" (1,-1) would require moving down and left, which is possible if the path is clear.

This seems complicated. Maybe the best immediate action is to move towards the ""is"" rule to manipulate it. But given the walls, it's difficult. Alternatively, try to move down to reach lower objects.

Wait, the ""door"" is at (-1,0), which is to my left. If I move left, can I reach it? From (0,0) moving left once to (-1,0), which is the door's position. But the door's rule is at (-1,0), and the active rule is ""baba is you"". So touching the door would normally not do anything unless there's a ""door is win"" rule. But there isn't one. So moving left to the door wouldn't help unless I change the rules.

Alternatively, move to the ""is"" rule at (8,5) to create a new rule. But how? Maybe move down from (8,5) to (8,4), then left to (7,4), etc., until reaching a position to place the ""is"" rule next to another text block.

This is getting too time-consuming. Perhaps the correct action now is to move down to reach lower objects where there are fewer walls. For example, moving down from my current position (assuming I'm at (0,0)) to (0,-1), then right or left. But I need to check if that's possible.

Looking at the objects, there's a wall at 4 steps right and 1 step down: (4,-1). So if I move down to (0,-1), then right, I might encounter that wall. Alternatively, move left to (-1, -1), which is Baba's position. But I need to move the ""baba"" rule to create a new rule.

Wait, the ""baba"" rule","

Let's try to figure out what to do here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I can move Baba around. The goal is usually to reach the ""win"" object, but I need to check if that's still the case.

Looking at the objects, there's a ""door"" 1 step to the left. But doors are usually ""win"" sometimes, but here the active rules still say ""baba is you"" and no ""door is win."" Wait, there's a ""rule `door` 6 steps to the right and 1 step down."" Hmm, maybe that's a rule that's not active yet unless I move it. But I can't move the door itself; I can only move text blocks.

The key is at 2 steps to the right and 4 steps up. Maybe I need to get the key first? But how? The walls are blocking the path. The walls are either to the right or up, so maybe I need to move some of the ""is"" rules to change the properties of the walls or stops.

Looking at the rule `is` at 8 steps right and 5 up. That's part of the ""baba is you"" rule. If I can move that ""is"" rule next to another object, I could change a property. For example, if I move ""is"" next to ""stop,"" then ""stop is you"" or something like that, but I need to see the available objects.

There's a ""rule `stop` 4 step up."" If I can move the ""is"" next to ""stop,"" then maybe ""stop is you,"" making stop an immovable object, which might block my path. Alternatively, if I move ""is"" next to ""wall,"" I could change wall's properties. But right now, the walls are stopping me from moving left or up.

Wait, the current position of Baba is at 2 steps left and 1 step down according to the last observation. So Baba is near the left side. The door is 1 step left, so maybe that's the exit. But how to get there? The walls are blocking the path. To the right there are walls at 3 steps right, 4 steps right, etc. Up there's walls again.

The key is at 2 steps right and 4 steps up. If I could get that key, maybe a rule allows using keys to open doors? But in Baba Is You, usually, you need to push blocks or rearrange rules. Since I'm Baba and can move, maybe I need to use the ""is"" rule to create a new rule that allows passing through walls or stops.

For example, if I move the ""rule `is`"" next to ""wall"" and ""you,"" making ""wall is you,"" then walls would be controllable. But right now, the active rule is ""baba is you,"" so moving ""is"" to make ""wall is you"" would require placing ""wall IS YOU"" as a new rule. Then I could push walls out of the way.

Alternatively, moving the ""is"" to make ""stop is you"" would make stops controllable, but stops are immovable unless their property is changed. Wait, ""stop"" defines immovability. If I can change ""stop"" to be something else, maybe I can move through stops.

Another idea: the ""rule `win`"" is far to the right. If I can change the ""win"" rule to be Baba or another object, then reaching that rule would make me win. For example, moving ""is"" next to ""baba"" and ""win"" to make ""baba is win,"" then touching the ""win"" rule would make me win.

But how to move the ""is"" rules? The ""rule `is`"" at 8 steps right and 5 up is quite far. Maybe I need to navigate Baba to that area. But the path is blocked by walls. If I can change the walls to be movable, then I can push them aside.

Looking at the ""rule `wall`"" at 2 steps left and 4 up. If I move ""is"" next to that, creating ""wall is you,"" then walls would be controllable. Then I could push the walls out of the way to access the ""is"" rule at 8 steps right.

But to get to that ""rule `wall`,"" I need to move left or up. Let's check Baba's current position. The last observation shows ""rule `baba` 2 step to the left and 1 step down,"" which means Baba is located at position: 2 steps left from the reference point and 1 step down. The reference point is probably the starting position, but without a map layout, it's a bit tricky. But the key is at 2 steps right and 4 up from Baba's position.

Alternatively, maybe the best approach is to move towards the ""is"" rule at 8 steps right and 5 up to create a new rule. For example, moving ""is"" next to ""win"" to make ""win is you,"" but currently, the active rule is ""baba is you."" If I can make ""win is you,"" then touching the win rule would make me win. But how?

Wait, the ""rule `win`"" is at 8 steps right and 5 up. If I can move the ""is"" next to it and another subject, like ""baba,"" then ""baba is win"" would make touching the win rule win the game. So maybe the plan is:

1. Move Baba to the position of the ""rule `is`"" at 7 steps right and 5 up (from the previous observation, maybe?), then move that ""is"" next to ""baba"" and ""win"" to create ""baba is win.""

But navigating there is blocked by walls. The walls are at 3 steps right and up to 5 steps up. So maybe I need to push the walls aside by changing their properties.

Alternatively, use the ""key"" to unlock something, but I don't see a rule about keys here. Maybe the key is a red herring, or maybe it's needed to activate a hidden rule.

Another angle: the ""rule `door` 6 steps to the right and 1 step down"" could be a rule that says ""door is win"" if moved appropriately. If I can place that rule next to ""win,"" then door becomes win. But how?

This is getting complicated. Let's try to outline possible steps:

1. Move Baba towards the ""is"" rules to manipulate them.
2. Use an ""is"" rule to create a new rule that changes the win condition to something reachable.
3. Navigate around walls by either pushing them (if they become movable) or finding a path.

Given the repetitive failures, maybe the correct action is to move left to get closer to the ""is"" rule at 8 steps right and 5 up? Wait, no, moving left would take Baba further left, away from the right-sided objects. Maybe the correct move is to go right to reach the ""is"" rules.

But the walls are at 3 steps right. If I can move the ""wall is you"" rule, then I can push the walls. So perhaps:

- Move left to reach the ""rule `is`"" at 7 steps right and 5 up, then move it next to ""wall"" and ""you"" to create ""wall is you.""
- Then, as wall is you, I can push the walls aside to access the ""is"" rule at 8 steps right.

But how to navigate there? The current position of Baba is 2 steps left and 1 step down. Moving right would take me towards the walls. Maybe first move down to avoid the walls above.

Alternatively, move up past the walls, but they are at 4 steps up. If I can make the walls movable, then I can push them. But to do that, I need to create ""wall is you.""

So step by step:

1. Move right towards the ""rule `is`"" at 7 steps right and 5 up. But there's a wall at 3 steps right and 4 up. If I can move that wall, maybe by changing its rule.

Wait, the ""rule `wall`"" is at 2 steps left and 4 up. If I can move that ""rule `wall`"" next to an ""is"" rule, I can create ""wall is [property].""

Alternatively, move the ""is"" rule next to ""wall"" and ""you"" to make ""wall is you.""

But to do that, I need to get Baba to the position where he can pick up the ""is"" rule and move it.

Given the previous failed actions, maybe the correct action now is to move left towards the ""rule `is`"" at 1 step down, which is at 1 step down from Baba's position. Or move down to reach lower objects.

Alternatively, since the door is 1 step to the left, maybe moving left towards the door could be the solution. But the door is likely ""win"" if the rule is ""door is win,"" but the active rules don't indicate that. The active rule is still ""baba is you,"" and ""win"" is a separate object.

Wait, in some levels, the door becomes win when you push it with a rule. Maybe I need to create a rule like ""door is win"" by moving the ""is"" next to ""door"" and ""win.""

The ""rule `door`"" is at 6 steps right and 1 step down. If I can move the ""is"" rule to that position and next to ""win,"" then ""door is win"" would be created, making the door the win object.

So steps:

1. Move Baba to the position of the ""rule `is`"" at 7 steps right and 5 up.
2. Move that ""is"" rule down to the area of the door (6 steps right, 1 step down).
3. Place the ""is"" next to ""door"" and ""win"" to create ""door is win.""
4. Then, move towards the door to win.

But navigating there is blocked by walls. The walls are at 3 steps right, so moving right from Baba's position (2 steps left, 1 down) would require moving past the walls. If walls are movable after changing their rule, then this could work.

Alternatively, use the key to unlock, but there's no rule about keys here. Maybe the key is to activate a hidden rule, but I'm not sure.

Another possibility: The ""rule `key`"" at 7 steps right and 1 step up. If I can create a rule like ""key is push"" or something, but I don't see a ""push"" property.

This is quite complex. Given the previous failures, maybe the correct action now is to move left to get closer to the ""is"" rule at 1 step down, which is part of the ""baba is you"" rule. Moving left might allow picking up that ""is"" rule and moving it elsewhere.

Alternatively, move down to the area with the ""rule `is`"" at 2 steps right and 1 step up. If I can move that ""is"" rule next to ""key"" and another property, but I don't see a clear path.

After trying different directions and failing, perhaps the correct action is to move left towards the ""rule `is`"" at 1 step down, which is adjacent to ""baba"" and ""you."" By moving that ""is"" rule next to ""win,"" I can create ""baba is win"" or ""you is win.""

Wait, the ""win"" rule is at 8 steps right and 5 up. That's quite far. Maybe instead, create ""you is win"" so that touching any 'you' object (which Baba is) would make him win. But how?

If I can make the rule ""you is win,"" then since Baba is you, touching any 'win' object would make him win. But the 'win' object is a rule, not a property. Maybe this isn't the right approach.

Alternatively, create ""baba is win"" by moving the ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" and ""win."" The ""baba"" rule is at 2 steps left and 1 step down. So if I can move the ""is"" rule from 7 steps right and 5 up to be next to ""baba"" and ""win,"" that would work.

But the distance is too big. Need to navigate Baba to that area.

Given the time I've spent and previous failures, perhaps the best action now is to move right towards the walls to find a way to push them after changing their rule. Or move up to reach the higher ""is"" rules.

Another idea: The ""rule `stop`"" at 4 step up. If I can make ""stop is you,"" then stops become controllable. But how?

Move the ""is"" rule next to ""stop"" and ""you."" The ""stop"" rule is at 4 step up. If I can get there, but the path is blocked by walls.

This is really tricky. Maybe the solution is to move left to interact with the ""is"" rule at 1 step down, which is adjacent to ""baba"" and ""you."" By moving that ""is"" rule next to ""win,"" creating ""win is you,"" then touching the 'win' rule would make me win.

So steps:

1. Move left to the ""is"" rule at 1 step down.
2. Move that ""is"" rule up to the ""win"" rule at 8 steps right and 5 up.
3. Place them together to make ""win is you.""

But navigating there requires moving past walls. Alternatively, since the ""is"" rule is at 2 steps right and 1 step up, maybe move up and right to reach the ""win"" rule.

Alternatively, use the key to unlock something, but I don't see a key-related rule.

Given all this, I think the most feasible action right now is to move left towards the ""is"" rule at 1 step down to manipulate it and create a new rule that changes the win condition.

Let's try to figure out what to do here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I can move around and potentially manipulate other rules.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a door to the right, but it's probably locked. Wait, maybe I need to change the 'win' condition? The 'win' rule is way to the right at 10 steps right and 5 up. That's probably out of reach right now. 

Hmm, there's a key at 3 steps right and 4 up. If I can get that key, maybe I can unlock something. But the path to the key is blocked by walls. Wait, the walls are all labeled as 'wall' and there's a 'stop' rule nearby. Since 'stop' makes objects immovable, I can't push through them. But since I'm Baba and the rule is ""baba is you,"" maybe I can move the 'is' text blocks to create new rules. 

Looking at the positions, there's a rule `is` at 9 steps right and 5 up. If I can move that 'is' closer to the key or the door, maybe I can form a new rule. For example, if I take the 'is' and combine it with 'key' to make ""key is you,"" then I could become the key and move through walls. But how do I move the 'is' text block? The key is at 3 right, 4 up. The 'is' is at 9 right, 5 up. The distance is quite far. Maybe I need to navigate to that 'is' first. 

Alternatively, the door is at 1 step right. There's a rule `door` at 8 steps right and 1 down. If I can change the 'door' to 'win,' maybe I can reach it. To do that, I need to move the 'win' rule somewhere else or create a new rule like ""door is win."" But the 'win' is currently at 10 right, 5 up. Maybe I can grab the 'is' block and place it next to 'door' and 'win' to form ""door is win."" 

Wait, but how do I move the 'is' block? I need to be adjacent to it. The current position of 'baba' is at 1 step down. Let me check the position of 'baba' in the latest observation. The rule `baba` is at 1 step down. So I'm possibly located at that position. To move the 'is' block at 9 right, 5 up, I need to get there. The path is blocked by walls, but since I'm Baba, maybe I can push the walls if they're not 'stop.' Wait, the walls have 'wall' and 'stop' rules. The 'stop' at 1 right, 4 up makes that area immovable. So I can't push past that. 

Maybe I should focus on the 'you' rule. The 'you' is at 2 steps right and 1 down. If I can change 'you' to something else, like 'win,' then touching the door would make me win. For example, creating ""you is win."" But to do that, I need to move the 'is' block next to 'you' and 'win.' 

Alternatively, since I'm already 'you' (because 'baba is you'), maybe I can pick up the 'key' and then use it to unlock the door. But how? If I become the key by making ""key is you,"" then I could move through walls. Let's see. There's a 'key' at 3 right, 4 up. If I can move the 'is' block next to 'key' and then say 'you' next to it, forming ""key is you."" Then, I could move as the key. 

So the steps would be: move to the 'is' block at 9 right, 5 up. But how do I get there? My current position is at 'baba' which is 1 step down. Looking at the map, the 'baba' rule is at 1 step down, which might be near the bottom of the map. To reach the 'is' block at 9 right, 5 up, I need to move up and right multiple times. But the path is blocked by walls. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a different approach. The 'door' is at 1 step right. If I can make the door the win condition, then touching it would win. To do that, create ""door is win."" The 'win' rule is already at 10 right, 5 up. So I need to move the 'is' block next to 'door' and 'win.' The 'door' rule is at 8 right, 1 down. The 'win' is at 10 right, 5 up. The 'is' is at 9 right, 5 up. So if I move the 'is' from 9 right,5 up to 8 right,1 down (next to 'door'), then create ""door is win"" by placing 'is' between them. But how do I move the 'is' block? I need to be adjacent to it and move it one step at a time. 

Given that the previous actions have been failing due to invalid moves, maybe I need to first navigate to the 'is' block. Let's see: current position of 'baba' is at 1 step down. To get to the 'is' at 9 right,5 up, I need to move up 5 steps and right 9 steps. But there are walls in the way. The walls are at 5 steps right and up to 5 steps. So maybe the path is blocked. 

Alternatively, maybe the key is more accessible. The key is at 3 right,4 up. If I can move there, pick it up, but how? Since I'm Baba, maybe I can push objects that are not 'stop.' The walls are 'stop,' so I can't push them. But the 'key' isn't mentioned as 'stop,' so maybe I can move it. Wait, the rules only say 'baba is you' right now. So other objects can be moved unless they're 'stop.' The key is a regular object, so I can pick it up and move it. 

So maybe the plan is: move to the key at 3 right,4 up, pick it up, then use it to unlock the door. But how does the key help? Unless I create a rule like ""key is unlock"" or something. But I need an 'is' block for that. 

Alternatively, if I can move the 'is' block next to the key and then say 'you' next to it, making ""key is you."" Then, as the key, I could move through walls. Once I'm the key, I can go through the walls and reach the door or the win condition. 

So step by step: 

1. Move to the 'is' block at 9 right,5 up. To do that, from my current position (1 step down), I need to move up 5 steps and right 9 steps. But there are walls blocking the path. 

Wait, looking at the objects, there's a wall at 5 steps right and 5 up. So if I'm trying to go right 9 steps, I hit a wall at 5 steps right. That's a problem. 

Maybe there's another 'is' block. There's another 'is' at 3 steps right and 1 step up. That's closer. So maybe I can use that 'is' block instead. 

The 'is' at 3 right,1 up. If I move there, then I can create a new rule. For example, ""key is you."" The key is at 3 right,4 up. So if I move the 'is' from 3 right,1 up to be next to the key and then place the 'you' there. 

So the plan: 

- Move to the 'is' at 3 right,1 up. 

- Then move that 'is' block next to the key (3 right,4 up). 

- Then move the 'you' block (which is at 2 right,1 down) next to the 'is' and key to form ""key is you."" 

Once that's done, I become the key and can move through walls. Then I can go to the door at 1 step right or the win condition at 10 right,5 up. 

But how do I move the 'is' block? I need to be adjacent to it. Let's see my current position is at 'baba' which is 1 step down. Where is that exactly? The 'baba' rule is at 2 step to the left and 1 step down in one of the previous observations, but in the latest observation, it's rule `baba` 1 step down. So perhaps my current position is at coordinates that allow me to move towards the 'is' at 3 right,1 up. 

Let me visualize the map. 

The 'baba' rule is 1 step down. So my position is likely at (0,0) or similar, and the 'is' at 3 right,1 up is at (3,1). To get there, I need to move right 3 times and up once. But are there walls in the way? The walls are at 5 steps right and up to 5, so if I'm moving right from 0 to 3, there are no walls until 5. So it's possible. 

So first action: move right three times to reach the 'is' block at 3 right,1 up. Then move up to place it next to the key. 

But the previous actions have been failing, so maybe I need to try moving in a specific direction. 

Looking at the latest observation, after several failed attempts, the last valid action was 'left' which might have moved me closer. Now, the current observation shows the active rules still as ""baba is you,"" and the objects are in the same positions as before. So perhaps the agent is stuck in a loop. 

Alternatively, maybe the solution is to move to the 'is' block at 9 right,5 up and create a rule that changes 'you' to 'win.' For example, ""you is win,"" which would mean touching anything 'you' makes you win. But since I'm already 'you,' that might work. 

To do that, I need to move the 'is' block next to 'you' and 'win.' The 'you' is at 2 right,1 down, and 'win' is at 10 right,5 up. The 'is' is at 9 right,5 up. So if I move the 'is' from 9 right,5 up to 2 right,1 down, placing it between 'you' and 'win' to form ""you is win."" 

But the distance is too great. How to move the 'is' block? Maybe by pushing other objects, but they're walls or stops. 

Alternatively, use the existing 'is' at 3 right,1 up. Move that one next to 'you' and 'win.' 

The 'is' at 3 right,1 up. If I move it to be next to 'you' at 2 right,1 down, then place 'win' next to it. But 'win' is at 10 right,5 up. That's not adjacent. 

This is getting complicated. Maybe the simplest solution is to move towards the 'is' block that's closer and create a rule that makes 'baba' win. For example, ""baba is win."" But since 'baba' is already you, and if 'win' is an object, touching it would win. But the 'win' rule is separate. 

Alternatively, create ""you is win,"" which would make anything 'you' (which is me) win upon touching. So if I can form that rule, then just moving towards the door or any 'you' object would make me win. 

To create ""you is win,"" I need to have 'you', 'is', and 'win' adjacent. The 'you' is at 2 right,1 down. The 'is' is at 9 right,5 up or 3 right,1 up. The 'win' is at 10 right,5 up. 

The closest 'is' is at 3 right,1 up. If I can move that 'is' next to 'you' and 'win,' but they're not adjacent. 

Alternatively, use the 'is' at 9 right,5 up. If I can move it down to the 'you' and 'win' area. But the path is blocked by walls. 

Maybe the key here is to realize that the door is at 1 step right. If I can make the door the win condition, then touching it would win. So create ""door is win."" The 'door' is at 8 right,1 down. The 'win' is at 10 right,5 up. The 'is' is at 9 right,5 up. So if I move the 'is' from 9 right,5 up to 8 right,1 down, placing it between 'door' and 'win' to form ""door is win."" 

To do that, I need to move the 'is' block from (9,5) to (8,1). That's a move right 1 and down 4. But how? Each move is one step. So I need to navigate the 'is' block down and left. But the path might be blocked by walls. 

Alternatively, use the other 'is' block at 3 right,1 up. Move that one to 8 right,1 down. But that's a long way. 

This is really tricky. Maybe the solution is to move to the 'is' block at 3 right,1 up, then move it next to the 'door' and 'win' rules. 

But given the time I've spent and the previous failures, perhaps the best immediate action is to move towards the 'is' block at 3 right,1 up to try and create a new rule. So the next action should be to move right again, or up. 

Wait, the last action was 'left', which might have moved me back. So maybe I need to go right towards the 'is' block. 

In the current observation, the 'baba' rule is at 1 step down. So my position is likely at a coordinate that allows moving right and up. 

Given the previous actions, the assistant kept trying left and down, which might not be effective. Perhaps the correct move is to move right towards the 'is' block at 3 right,1 up. 

So the chosen action is 'right'.

Let's try to figure out the next move here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I can move and interact with objects. The goal is usually to reach the ""win"" object, but I need to check if that's still the case.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ""door"" located 7 steps to the right and 1 step down from my current position. The ""win"" rule is 9 steps to the right and 5 steps up, which seems pretty far. But maybe there's a way to change the win condition. 

I notice there are some ""is"" rules scattered around. For example, there's a rule at 3 steps to the right and 1 step up that says ""is."" If I can move that ""is"" rule next to the ""door"" and combine it with ""win,"" maybe I can change the win condition to ""door is win."" That would let me win by reaching the door instead. 

To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule. But how? The key is at 2 steps to the right and 4 steps up. Maybe I need to get the key first to unlock something, but the walls are blocking the path. Wait, the current rules don't have anything about keys unlocking doors, so maybe the key isn't necessary here. 

Looking at my position, I'm at ""baba"" which is 1 step to the left and 1 step down from the bottom. The ""is"" rule is directly below me at 1 step down. If I move down once, I can grab that ""is"" rule. But wait, can I pick up the ""is"" rule? The rules say I can move text blocks that aren't ""STOP"" or similar. Since ""is"" isn't labeled as stop, I should be able to move it. 

So the plan is: move down to pick up the ""is"" rule, then move right to place it next to the ""door"" and the ""win"" rule. Once that's done, ""door is win"" would make touching the door win the level. Then I can move to the door and collect the win. 

But let me check the steps again. My current position is ""baba"" at 1 step left and 1 step down. The ""is"" rule is 1 step down from there. So moving down once would put me on the ""is"" rule. Then I can move right to place it next to the ""door"" which is 7 steps to the right. Wait, but after moving down, I need to move right multiple times to reach the door's position. However, there are walls at 4 steps to the right in various directions. Hmm, maybe there's a path around. 

Alternatively, maybe I should move right first to get closer. Let me visualize the map. The walls are blocking direct paths, but since I'm ""baba is you,"" I can move through walls unless they have the ""STOP"" property. Looking at the active rules, the ""stop"" is at 4 steps up. So walls above might be stop, but others might not. Wait, the ""wall"" objects have different positions. The ""stop"" rule is at 4 steps up, so any wall at 4 steps up is stop. Others might just be regular walls. 

So, to reach the ""is"" rule below, moving down is safe. Then, once I have the ""is"" rule, I need to carry it to the door and the win rule. Let's outline the steps:

1. Move down to grab the ""is"" rule.
2. Move right to the door's location (7 steps right, 1 step down).
3. Place the ""is"" rule next to the ""door"" and the ""win"" rule to make ""door is win.""
4. Then move to the door and win.

But how to navigate the walls? Let's check the walls' positions. There are walls at 4 steps right and 5 up, 4 right and 4 up, etc. So moving right from my current position (which is 1 step left and 1 down), moving right would take me towards the walls at 4 steps right. But maybe there's a path around by moving up or down. 

Alternatively, after picking up the ""is"" rule, move right step by step, avoiding the walls. Since I can move through non-stop objects, perhaps I can navigate around the walls by moving in the right direction. 

Another thing to consider: The ""key"" is at 2 steps right and 4 up. Not sure if needed, but maybe to open a door, but earlier thoughts say the key might not be necessary here. 

So focusing on steps:

First action: move down to get the ""is"" rule. Then move right towards the door. Let's see:

Current position: baba at 1 left, 1 down.

Moving down: action ""down"" to get to the ""is"" rule at 1 step down.

Once there, pick up the ""is"" rule and move right. Each move right would decrement the right steps until reaching the door's position (7 steps right). But need to check if there are walls in between. 

Looking at the walls: 

- At 4 steps right and various ups.
- At 1 step left and 4 up (a wall).
- At 4 step up (another wall).

So moving right from my current position (after moving down), the path might be blocked by walls at 4 steps right. But since I can move through non-stop objects, maybe I can go around by moving up or down while moving right. 

Alternatively, after getting the ""is"" rule, move up to avoid walls and then right. 

This is getting a bit complicated. Maybe the first valid action is to move down to get the ""is"" rule. Then, once that's done, figure out the next moves. But the system requires choosing an action now, so I need to pick the next immediate action based on the current observation.

The current observation shows that after several left and right moves, the agent is back near the initial position with the ""is"" rule below. The latest observation has the ""baba"" at 1 step left and 1 step down, with the ""is"" rule directly below at 1 step down. So the immediate next action should be ""down"" to pick up that ""is"" rule.

Let's try to figure out what to do here. The active rule right now is ""baba is you,"" which means that whatever I do, Baba (which is me) can perform actions like pushing things or moving through certain blocks unless they're defined as STOP or similar.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key located 2 steps to the right and 4 steps up. There's also a door at 7 steps to the right and 1 step down. My goal is usually to reach the WIN condition, but I need to check if that's still the case. The active rules show ""baba is you,"" and there's no ""win"" rule defined beyond the existing one, which is ""rule 'win' 9 steps to the right and 5 step up."" So the WIN condition is probably at that position. But there are walls blocking the path up there.

The key is to the right and up a bit. Maybe I need to get the key first to unlock something? But how? The key is behind some walls. The walls are tagged as STOP, which means I can't push them unless I change the rule. The rule 'wall' is at 1 step left and 4 step up, and another 'wall' rule at 4 steps up. So the walls are immutable unless I can rewrite those rules.

Looking at the available text blocks: there's a 'rule `is`' at 8 steps right and 5 up, which is part of the ""BABA IS YOU"" rule. Maybe if I can move that 'is' text block, I can change the rules. But wait, the 'is' itself is a rule. To move a text block, it has to not be STOP. Are any of the text blocks not STOP? The 'stop' rule is at 4 step up, so the STOP property is there. But the 'is' and 'win' and 'key' rules might be movable. Let me check.

The objects include rule `is` at 8 right,5 up; rule `win` at 9 right,5 up; rule `wall` at 1 left,4 up; rule `stop` at 4 up; rule `key` at 8 right,1 up. The walls are all either at 4 steps up or further down. So the text blocks like 'is', 'win', 'key', 'wall', 'stop' are on positions that might be movable. But since the current rules have 'stop' at 4 up, does that mean any text block on a STOP object can't be moved? Wait, no. The STOP property is applied to certain objects, like the walls. The text blocks themselves are separate. For example, the 'rule `stop` 4 step up' means that the object at 4 step up has the STOP property. So if I can move the text block 'rule `stop`', maybe I can remove the STOP property from that wall.

But first, where is Baba located? The observation mentions ""rule `baba` 1 step to the left and 1 step down."" So Baba is at position (1 left, 1 down) relative to some reference point. I need to figure out my current position to plan the movement. But maybe I don't need the exact coordinates. The key is to figure out the sequence of actions to either reach the WIN area or manipulate the rules.

Since the active rule is ""baba is you,"" I can move around. The immediate goal might be to reach the key to potentially unlock the door or change another rule. The door is at 7 steps right and 1 down, which is to the right of where I am (assuming Baba is at 1 left, 1 down). Wait, if Baba is 1 step to the left and 1 step down from the reference point, and the door is 7 steps right and 1 down, moving right multiple times could get me there. But there's a wall at 4 steps right and down, so I need to navigate around that.

Alternatively, maybe I can interact with the text blocks. For example, if I can move the 'is' text block at 8 right,5 up, maybe I can create a new rule like ""baba is win"" to make Baba the WIN condition. But to do that, I need to pick up the 'is' text block and place it next to 'baba' and 'win'. Let's see: the 'is' is at 8 right,5 up. If I move down from there, maybe I can reach it. But how do I move the 'is' block? I need to be adjacent to it and move it in a direction, but since it's a text block, I can only move it if the block it's on isn't STOP. The 'is' is on a rule tile, which might not be STOP. Let's check the STOP positions. The STOP is at 4 step up, which is a wall. So the 'is' text block is on a non-STOP tile, so I can move it.

So the plan could be: move to the 'is' text block at 8 right,5 up, pick it up, and then place it next to 'baba' and 'win' to create a new rule. But first, I need to navigate there. Let's see the current position of Baba: 1 left, 1 down. The 'is' is 8 right and 5 up from there. So from Baba's position, moving right 8 times and up 5 times would get to the 'is' block. But there are walls along the way. For example, at 4 steps right and various ups, there are walls. So the path might be blocked. Alternatively, maybe there's a different text block that can be moved to create a new rule.

Alternatively, the key is at 2 right and 4 up. Maybe getting the key first would help, but to get there, I need to move right and up, but there's a wall at 4 steps right and 4 up. So perhaps I need to push the wall? But walls are STOP, so I can't. Unless I change the 'wall' rule. The 'wall' rule is at 1 left and 4 up. If I can move that 'wall' rule, I could remove the wall property from the object. So maybe the steps are: move to the 'wall' rule at 1 left,4 up, pick it up, and place it elsewhere to remove the wall definition. Then, I can move through the walls.

But how to reach the 'wall' rule? The 'wall' rule is 1 left and 4 up from Baba's position. So from Baba's position (1 left, 1 down), moving left 1 more step and up 4 steps would get there. Let's see: moving left from 1 left would be 2 left, and up 4 steps from 1 down would be 3 up. Wait, maybe the coordinates are relative. This part is a bit confusing without a visual map, but the key idea is to navigate to the relevant text blocks.

Alternatively, since the current rule is ""baba is you,"" and the goal is usually to reach the WIN condition, perhaps the WIN is at 9 right,5 up. To get there, I need to move right and up, but there are walls at 4 right and up to 5. Maybe I can push the walls if I change their rules. For example, if I can make a wall into a non-STOP object, then I can move through it.

Another approach: since the 'door' is at 7 right and 1 down, and there's a key at 2 right and 4 up, maybe the key is needed to open the door. But how? The door's rule is ""rule `door` 7 steps to the right and 1 step down."" To interact with the door, perhaps I need to have the key. But the key is separate. Unless there's a rule like ""key is unlock"" or something, but there's no such rule here. So maybe the key isn't directly useful unless I can create a rule that makes it unlock the door.

Alternatively, maybe the solution is to create a new rule that makes Baba into the WIN condition. For example, moving the 'is' text block next to 'baba' and 'win'. The 'win' is already a rule at 9 right,5 up. So if I can create ""baba is win"", then touching the WIN area would make Baba the WIN. To do that, I need to move the 'is' block from 8 right,5 up to be between 'baba' and 'win'.

So the steps would be:

1. Move to the 'is' block at 8 right,5 up.
2. Pick up the 'is' block and move it down to the area near 'baba' (which is at 1 left,1 down) and 'win' (9 right,5 up). But moving the 'is' block down from 5 up to, say, 1 down would require moving down 6 steps. However, the path might be blocked by walls or other objects.

But this seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe there's a closer text block. The 'you' rule is at 1 step to the right and 1 step down from Baba's position. So 'baba' is at 1 left,1 down; 'is' is at 1 step down; 'you' is at 1 step right and 1 step down. So if I can create a rule like ""baba is win"", I need to get the 'is' block next to 'baba' and 'win'.

Alternatively, maybe the current 'you' rule can be manipulated. Since 'baba is you', maybe changing 'you' to something else. But I'm not sure.

Another possibility: the 'stop' rule is at 4 step up. If I can remove the 'stop' property from the wall at 4 step up, then I can move through it. To do that, I need to move the 'stop' rule text block. The 'stop' rule is at 4 step up, which is a wall. So moving the 'stop' rule would require picking it up and placing it elsewhere, which might remove the STOP property from that wall.

So the plan could be:

1. Move to the 'stop' rule at 4 step up.
2. Pick it up and move it to a different location, say next to a different object, which would remove its STOP property.

Once the wall is no longer STOP, I can push through it. Then, I can proceed towards the WIN area.

But how to reach the 'stop' rule? From Baba's position (1 left,1 down), moving up 4 steps would get to the 'stop' rule at 4 step up. But along the way, at 4 steps right and 4 step up, there's a wall. Wait, no—the wall is at 4 steps to the right and 4 step up? Or is the wall's position separate from the 'stop' rule? The 'stop' rule is at 4 step up, which is likely on top of the wall. So the wall at 4 step up has the STOP property. To move the 'stop' rule, I need to be adjacent to it.

Assuming Baba is at 1 left,1 down, moving up 4 steps would place him at 1 left, 3 up (since each step up increases the up coordinate). Wait, the coordinates might be relative. This is getting a bit confusing without a visual, but the key is to figure out the sequence of movements.

Alternatively, maybe the immediate action is to move towards the 'is' block to create a new rule. Let's say I move right to reach the 'is' block. From the current position, moving right 8 times and up 5 times would get to the 'is' block. But there's a wall at 4 steps right and various ups. For example, at 4 right and 5 up, there's a wall. So moving right past that would be blocked unless the wall's rule is changed.

Alternatively, maybe the solution is to move the 'key' block to a different position, but I don't see how that helps immediately.

Another angle: since the door is at 7 right and 1 down, and the current 'you' rule is at 1 right and 1 down, perhaps combining 'baba' with 'door' using the 'is' rule. For example, creating ""baba is door"" would make touching the door win. But the door's rule is already present as ""rule `door` 7 steps to the right and 1 step down."" So if I can make Baba a door, then standing on the door would make him win.

To do that, I need to create the rule ""baba is door"". The existing 'door' rule is separate. So I would need to move the 'is' block next to 'baba' and 'door'. The 'is' block is at 8 right,5 up. The 'baba' is at 1 left,1 down. The 'door' is at 7 right,1 down. So the distance is significant. Maybe this isn't the easiest path.

Alternatively, since the 'win' rule is at 9 right,5 up, and the 'is' block is there, perhaps creating ""win is you"" or something. But the active rule is ""baba is you"", so if I can make ""win is you"", then reaching the win area would work. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the current active rules are only ""baba is you"". All other rules are defined as objects on the map but not active until their components are arranged. So to activate a new rule, like ""win is you"", I need to have the 'win', 'is', and 'you' text blocks adjacent in the correct order.

The 'you' rule is at 1 right,1 down. The 'win' rule is at 9 right,5 up. The 'is' rule is at 8 right,5 up. So perhaps moving the 'you' rule down to be near the 'win' and 'is' rules. For example, moving 'you' from 1 right,1 down to 9 right,5 up area. But that's a long distance.

Alternatively, maybe the solution is simpler. Since the player is Baba and the rule is ""baba is you"", maybe the goal is to reach the WIN area, which is at 9 right,5 up. But the path is blocked by walls. So the way to unblock it is to change the 'wall' rule. The 'wall' rule is at 1 left,4 up. If I can move that 'wall' rule, say, to a different position, it would remove the wall definition from the object at 4 up.

For example, moving the 'wall' rule from 1 left,4 up to somewhere else, like next to a different object. Then, the wall at 4 up would no longer have the WALL property, making it passable.

So the steps would be:

1. Move to the 'wall' rule at 1 left,4 up.
2. Pick it up and move it to a new location, say next to a key or another object, thereby removing the WALL property from the original position.

Once the wall is no longer a wall, I can move through it and reach the WIN area.

To do that, I need to navigate to the 'wall' rule. From Baba's position (1 left,1 down), moving left 1 more step and up 4 steps would get to the 'wall' rule. Let's break it down:

- Current position: 1 left, 1 down.
- Move left once: 2 left, 1 down.
- Move up four times: 2 left, 5 up.

But along the way, at 4 steps right and various positions, there are walls. Wait, the walls are at 4 steps to the right and various ups. So moving left from Baba's position wouldn't encounter those walls immediately. The walls are on the right side.

So moving left to reach the 'wall' rule at 1 left,4 up seems feasible. Once there, pick up the 'wall' rule and move it, say, to the right next to the 'key' rule at 8 right,1 up. Placing the 'wall' rule there would redefine it, potentially removing the wall property from the original spot.

After that, the wall at 4 up would be gone, allowing passage. Then, moving right past the previous wall location and up to the WIN area.

Alternatively, maybe there's a closer text block to interact with. The 'is' rule is at 8 right,5 up. If I can move that to create a new rule, like ""baba is win"", that would make touching the WIN area win.

To create ""baba is win"", I need to have 'baba', 'is', and 'win' adjacent. The 'baba' is at 1 left,1 down. The 'win' is at 9 right,5 up. The 'is' is at 8 right,5 up. So the 'is' is between 'win' and where? Maybe moving the 'is' down to be near 'baba' and 'win'.

But the distance is quite large. Maybe another approach: since the 'you' rule is at 1 right,1 down, perhaps creating ""baba is win you"" or something, but that's not a valid rule format. Rules are in the format ""[Subject] IS [Property]"".

So the valid new rule would be ""baba IS win"", which requires the 'is' block between 'baba' and 'win'.

To do that, I need to move the 'is' block from 8 right,5 up to a position between 'baba' (1 left,1 down) and 'win' (9 right,5 up). That's a significant move. Maybe this isn't feasible in one go.

Alternatively, maybe the solution is to move the 'key' to the door. The door is at 7 right,1 down. The key is at 2 right,4 up. If I can move the key to the door, perhaps a new rule is triggered. But there's no existing rule that links key and door, so that might not help.

Another idea: the 'stop' rule is at 4 step up. If I can remove the STOP property from the wall at 4 step up, then I can move through it. As mentioned earlier, moving the 'stop' rule text block would achieve this. The 'stop' rule is at 4 step up, which is on the same tile as a wall. So picking up the 'stop' rule and placing it elsewhere would remove the STOP property from that wall.

So the steps here would be:

1. Move to the 'stop' rule at 4 step up.
2. Pick it up and move it to a different location, say next to the 'key' rule.

Once the 'stop' rule is moved, the wall at 4 step up is no longer STOP, so I can walk through it. Then, proceed right past it to the WIN","

I'm trying to figure out how to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. The active rule right now is ""baba is you,"" which means I can move around and manipulate the text blocks. My goal is probably to reach the ""win"" condition, which is usually the door or something similar. Let me look at the objects on the map again.

The objects listed are several walls, some rules like 'is', 'win', 'wall', 'stop', 'key', and a door. The key might be important to unlock something, but I don't see a lock mentioned. The door is at 7 steps to the right and 1 step down. But there's also a rule 'door' at that position, which might mean the door is part of the win condition. Wait, the active rules only have ""baba is you"" right now. So normally, touching the door wouldn't do anything unless there's a ""door is win"" rule. But in the current observation, the active rules don't include that. Hmm.

Looking at the positions, Baba is at 1 step to the left and 1 step down. So my current position is somewhere, and I can move around. The 'is' rule is at 8 steps to the right and 5 steps up. Since I'm Baba and can move, I might need to move that 'is' rule to create new rules. For example, if I can move the 'is' next to 'win' and 'key', maybe I can make ""key is win"" or something. But first, I need to navigate to those text blocks.

Wait, the key is at 2 steps to the right and 4 steps up. There's a wall in the way at 4 steps right and 4 steps up. So maybe I need to move the 'stop' property or rearrange the walls. But the walls are defined as 'wall is you'... no, wait, the active rule is only ""baba is you,"" so walls are normally stoppable unless their rule changes. But right now, since there's no ""wall is stop"" active, maybe I can push past them? Wait, no, the default is that walls are stop. Wait, no, in Baba Is You, unless there's a rule saying ""wall is not stop,"" walls are stop. But in the current active rules, there's ""baba is you,"" and the other rules are part of the level's setup but not active unless moved. So maybe the walls are stoppable. So I need to find a way to move past them.

Looking at the map, the key is up at 4 steps up, but there's a wall at 4 steps right and 4 steps up. So maybe I need to move that wall's rule. The 'wall' rule is at 1 step left and 4 steps up. If I can move that 'wall' rule somewhere else, perhaps I can remove the wall blocking the key's path. But to do that, I need to move the 'wall' text block, which is probably a 'stop' object unless there's a rule saying otherwise. Wait, since the active rules are only ""baba is you,"" and the 'stop' rule is at 4 step up, which is part of the level's initial setup but not active. So maybe I can move the 'wall' rule block.

So the plan might be: move towards the 'is' rule at 8 steps right and 5 up, then use that to create new rules. For example, if I can bring 'is' next to 'key' and 'win', I could make ""key is win"" or ""win is door"". But first, I need to navigate to those positions.

But currently, Baba is at 1 step left and 1 step down. The 'is' rule is up high, 8 steps right and 5 up. That's quite a distance. Maybe there's a shorter path. Alternatively, maybe the key is nearby. The key is at 2 steps right and 4 up. From my current position, moving right twice and up four times would get there, but there's a wall at 4 steps right and 4 up. Wait, no, the wall is at 4 steps right and 4 steps up, which is directly in the path from the key's position (2 right,4 up) to the key. So I can't go straight there. Maybe I need to rearrange the walls.

Alternatively, maybe the door at 7 steps right and 1 down is the win condition. But how to make that the case? Since currently, ""baba is you"" but no ""door is win"" rule. So unless I can create that rule by moving 'is' next to 'door' and 'win'.

So steps:

1. Move to the 'is' rule at 8 right,5 up. To get there, from Baba's position (1 left,1 down), need to move right 2, up 6. But there are walls along the way. For example, at 4 steps right and 5 up is a wall. So maybe need to move that wall's rule.

The 'wall' rule is at 1 left and 4 up. If I can move that 'wall' rule to somewhere else, perhaps removing the wall blocking the path. But how? The 'wall' rule itself is a stop unless moved. So I need to move it. Since I'm Baba (you), I can move objects that are not stop. But the 'wall' rule is a text block that's part of the level. Wait, the 'wall' rule is a text block, which is not necessarily a stop unless there's a rule saying so. The active rules only have ""baba is you"". So maybe I can pick up the 'wall' rule and move it.

So, first, move from my current position (1 left,1 down) to the 'wall' rule at 1 left,4 up. To get there, I need to move up 3 steps. But there's a 'stop' rule at 4 step up. Wait, the 'stop' rule is at 4 step up. So that's a text block that defines something as stop. But since there's no active ""stop is stop"" rule, maybe I can move it. Wait, the active rules are only ""baba is you"". So any text block that's not defined as stop can be moved. So the 'stop' rule is a text block, and since there's no rule making it stop, I can move it.

So perhaps the strategy is:

- Move the 'stop' rule out of the way to access other objects.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, focus on getting the 'is' rule to create new rules.

Alternatively, check if the door is the win condition. Since the 'win' rule is at 9 steps right and 5 up, which is probably a text block. To make the door the win condition, I need to create ""door is win"" by moving 'is' next to 'door' and 'win'.

The door is at 7 steps right and 1 down. The 'win' rule is at 9 right,5 up. The 'is' rule is at 8 right,5 up. So if I can move the 'is' rule one step left to 7 right,5 up, then place it between 'door' (7 right,1 down) and 'win' (9 right,5 up), but that might not be possible due to positions.

Alternatively, maybe rearrange the 'is' rule to be next to both 'door' and 'win'. But their positions are too far apart. The 'win' is up high, and the door is down low. Maybe this isn't the right approach.

Another idea: use the key. If I can get the key, maybe there's a rule that involves the key. For example, ""key is win"" or ""key is you"". But to do that, I need to pick up the key, which is at 2 right,4 up. However, there's a wall at 4 right,4 up blocking the path. So I need to move that wall's rule.

The 'wall' rule is at 1 left,4 up. If I can move that 'wall' rule to somewhere else, like next to the wall at 4 right,4 up, replacing it, so the wall is no longer there. Then I can move past to get the key.

So steps:

1. Move to the 'wall' rule at 1 left,4 up.

2. Pick it up and move it to the position of the wall at 4 right,4 up. But how? The 'wall' rule is a text block; moving it there would replace the existing wall's rule, effectively removing the wall.

Once the wall is removed, I can go get the key at 2 right,4 up.

Then, with the key, maybe I need to unlock something, but I don't see a lock. Alternatively, use the key to create a new rule, like ""key is win"".

But to create a new rule, I need the 'is' rule. The 'is' is at 8 right,5 up. So after getting the key, move to the 'is' rule and place it next to 'key' and 'win' to make ""key is win"".

Alternatively, make ""baba is win"" to turn myself into the win condition.

But how to do that. If I can move the 'is' rule next to 'baba' and 'win', creating ""baba is win"".

Baba is at 1 left,1 down. The 'win' rule is at 9 right,5 up. The 'is' is at 8 right,5 up. So maybe move 'is' left to 7 right,5 up, then place it between Baba's position and 'win'.

But Baba's position is 1 left,1 down, which is quite far from the 'is' rule's location. This might require a lot of moving.

Alternatively, maybe the solution is simpler. Since the current active rule is ""baba is you"", and I'm Baba, I can move around. The door is at 7 right,1 down. If I can make the door the win condition, then touching it would win. To do that, create ""door is win"" by moving 'is' next to 'door' and 'win'.

The 'door' is at 7 right,1 down. The 'win' rule is at 9 right,5 up. The 'is' is at 8 right,5 up. So if I can move the 'is' rule one step left to 7 right,5 up, then it's between 'door' (7 right,1 down) and 'win' (9 right,5 up). Wait, but they are not adjacent. The 'is' at 7 right,5 up is not adjacent to the door at 7 right,1 down. So that wouldn't work.

Alternatively, move the 'is' rule down to 7 right,1 down, which is where the door is. But then placing 'is' there next to 'door' and 'win' isn't possible since they are in different positions.

Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe I need to look for other text blocks. The 'key' is at 2 right,4 up. If I can get the key and then use it to create a rule. For example, ""key is you"", making the key into a movable object. Then use the key to move other text blocks.

But to create ""key is you"", I need the 'is' rule next to 'key' and 'you'. The 'you' rule is at 1 step right and 1 step down, same as Baba's position. So if I can move the 'is' rule to be next to 'key' (2 right,4 up) and 'you' (1 right,1 down), that would create ""key is you"".

But the path to the key is blocked by the wall at 4 right,4 up. So first, need to remove that wall's rule. The 'wall' rule is at 1 left,4 up. Move that to elsewhere, say next to the wall at 4 right,4 up, replacing it. Then I can go get the key.

So step by step:

1. Move from Baba's position (1 left,1 down) to the 'wall' rule at 1 left,4 up. This requires moving up 3 steps.

But wait, the 'stop' rule is at 4 step up. Is that a problem? The 'stop' rule is a text block, and since there's no active rule making it stop, I can move it. So move up past the 'stop' rule.

2. Pick up the 'wall' rule and move it to the position of the wall at 4 right,4 up. Now, that wall is removed.

3. Move to the key at 2 right,4 up. Since the wall is gone, this path is clear.

4. Pick up the key and move it to a position where I can create a new rule. For example, next to 'is' (8 right,5 up) and 'you' (1 right,1 down).

But the key is at 2 right,4 up. To get to the 'is' rule at 8 right,5 up, need to move right 6 and up 1. That's a long way. Alternatively, move the 'is' rule to the key's position.

Alternatively, create ""key is you"" by placing 'is' between key and you. The 'you' is at 1 right,1 down. The key is at 2 right,4 up. The 'is' is at 8 right,5 up. These are not adjacent, so that won't work.

Hmm, maybe this isn't the right path. Let's think differently. Since I'm Baba and can move, maybe I can push the 'is' rule to create a new rule. For example, if I can make ""door is win"", then touching the door would win.

The door is at 7 right,1 down. The 'win' rule is at 9 right,5 up. The 'is' is at 8 right,5 up. So if I move the 'is' rule left to 7 right,5 up, then it's between the door (7 right,1 down) and the 'win' rule (9 right,5 up). But they are not adjacent. So that wouldn't create the rule.

Alternatively, move the 'win' rule down to be near the door. But the 'win' rule is part of the level's setup and might be fixed unless moved.

Another idea: Use the 'key' to unlock the door. But there's no lock mentioned. Alternatively, if I can make the key a 'win' by creating ""key is win"", then picking up the key would make me win. But to do that, I need to create that rule.

To create ""key is win"", need 'is' next to 'key' and 'win'. The key is at 2 right,4 up. The 'win' is at 9 right,5 up. The 'is' is at 8 right,5 up. So maybe move the 'is' rule left to 7 right,5 up, then down to 2 right,4 up? Not sure.

Alternatively, move the 'win' rule to be next to the key. But the 'win' is at 9 right,5 up, and the key is at 2 right,4 up. That's a big distance.

This is getting complicated. Maybe I should try to move the 'is' rule to a position where I can create a rule that makes Baba the win. For example, ""baba is win"". Since Baba is me, that would make touching anything win, or just make me the win object.

To create ""baba is win"", I need the 'is' rule next to 'baba' and 'win'. 'Baba' is at 1 left,1 down. 'Win' is at 9 right,5 up. 'Is' is at 8 right,5 up. So moving the 'is' rule left to 7 right,5 up, then down to 1 left,1 down? Not adjacent.

Alternatively, move the 'win' rule to be next to Baba. The 'win' is at 9 right,5 up. Moving it down to 1 left,1 down would require moving it 8 steps left and 4 steps down, which is impossible in one move. But maybe in multiple steps, but the game allows single steps at a time.

Wait, each action is a single step in one direction. So to move the 'win' rule from 9 right,5 up to 1 left,1 down, that's 10 steps left and 4 steps down. That's not feasible in a few moves.

Hmm. Maybe there's a simpler solution. Let's look again at the current active rules: only ""baba is you"". All other rules are part of the level's setup but not active. The door is at 7 right,1 down with a 'door' rule. The 'win' rule is up high. The 'key' is midway but blocked.

Perhaps the intended solution is to move the 'is' rule next to 'door' and 'win' to make ""door is win"". But how?

The 'door' is at 7 right,1 down. The 'win' is at 9 right,5 up. The 'is' is at 8 right,5 up. If I can move the 'is' one step left to 7 right,5 up, then it's between 'door' (7 right,1 down) and 'win' (9 right,5 up). But they are not adjacent. The 'is' at 7 right,5 up is diagonally next to the door at 7 right,1 down? No, because 5 up vs 1 down is a big difference. They are not adjacent in any direction.

Alternatively, move the 'win' rule down to 7 right,1 down. But that would require moving it 4 steps down, which is possible step by step. Once the 'win' rule is at the door's position, then placing 'is' there would make ""door is win"".

So steps:

1. Move the 'win' rule (9 right,5 up) down four steps to 9 right,1 down.

2. Place the 'is' rule next to it at 8 right,1 down.

3. Then, since the door is at 7 right,1 down, adjacent to the 'win' rule, creating ""door is win"".

But this seems possible. Let's see:

- To move the 'win' rule down, each move down would decrease the 'up' coordinate. From 5 up to 4 up, then 3, 2, 1.

So:

First, move from 9 right,5 up to 9 right,4 up.

Then to 9 right,3 up.

Then to 9 right,2 up.

Then to 9 right,1 up.

Now the 'win' rule is at 9 right,1 up","

97,down,"<reasoning>
Let me try to figure out what to do here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I can move Baba around. The goal is usually to get to the ""win"" object, but I need to check if that's still the case.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ""door"" 7 steps to the right and 1 step down, and a ""win"" rule 9 steps to the right and 5 steps up. But right now, the rules are still ""baba is you,"" so moving Baba towards the ""win"" rule might not work because the ""win"" rule is a text block, and I need to touch an object labeled ""win."" Wait, maybe the ""win"" is an object, not a rule? The observation says ""rule `win` 8 steps to the right and 5 step up,"" so it's a rule, not a regular object. Hmm, that complicates things. Usually, the win condition is an object, like a flag or door, but here it's a rule. Maybe I need to change the rules to make touching a different object count as winning.

Also, there's a ""key"" 2 steps to the right and 4 steps up. I might need to get that key first to open a door, but I don't know if there's a locked door somewhere. The door mentioned is at 7 steps right and 1 down, but I don't see a ""locked"" rule here. Maybe that door is just a regular door, and if I can reach it, it might be the win condition. But how do I know? The current rules don't say ""door is win,"" so I need to check if I can manipulate the rules to make touching the door win.

Looking at the objects, there's a ""rule `you`"" at 1 step to the right and 1 step down. Since I'm Baba and ""baba is you,"" maybe I can pick up the ""you"" rule and move it to the door or another object. Wait, but how do I interact with the text blocks? I need to move them, but some objects are ""stop,"" which means they can't be moved. Let me check the immovable objects. The ""stop"" rule is at 4 step up, but that's a rule, not an object. The walls are objects, but they're not marked as stop unless specified. So maybe the walls are stop? Wait, the rules are ""baba is you,"" and the walls have no other properties. So I can probably move past them unless they're tagged as stop. Looking at the objects, some walls have ""stop"" rules associated? Let me check:

The objects list includes ""rule `stop` 1 step to the left and 4 step up."" So that's a separate rule. But the walls themselves are just walls unless modified. So I can move through walls unless there's a ""stop"" rule attached to them. Wait, the active rules are ""baba is you,"" so I can push objects that aren't stopped. But the walls might be stopped if there's a ""wall is stop"" rule. Let me check the active rules again. The active rules are only ""baba is you,"" so walls aren't stopped. That means I can move around them, but the layout might block my path.

Looking at the map layout based on the observations, it seems there's a path to the right with walls and rules. The key is at 2 steps right and 4 up. Maybe I need to go get the key first, then find a way to the door. But how do I reach the key? The current position of Baba isn't specified here, but previous actions were moving left, right, down. Maybe Baba is at a certain spot. Wait, the observations mention ""rule `baba` 2 step to the left and 1 step down"" in some cases, but in the latest observation, it's ""rule `baba` 1 step to the left and 1 step down."" So Baba's position is 1 step left and 1 step down relative to where? Maybe the reference point is the player's position, but I'm not sure. This is getting a bit confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the solution involves rearranging the rules. For example, if I can make ""door is win,"" then touching the door would make me win. To do that, I need to move the ""win"" rule to the door's location or change the ""door"" rule to be ""win."" But the ""win"" rule is 8 steps to the right and 5 up, and the door is 7 steps right and 1 down. So the positions are different. To move the ""win"" rule, I have to pick it up and drag it to the door's location. But can I move the ""win"" rule? Since there's no ""stop"" rule on it, I should be able to. So the steps would be: move towards the ""win"" rule, pick it up, and carry it to the door's position. Then, place the ""win"" rule there, making ""door is win."" Once that's done, touching the door would make me win.

But how to do that in actions? I need to navigate to the ""win"" rule at 8 right, 5 up. From the current position, which isn't explicitly stated, but previous observations show movement. Let's assume the player is near the ""baba"" rule at 1 step left and 1 down. To reach the ""win"" rule at 8 right and 5 up, the player would need to move up 5 steps and right 8 steps. But there are walls blocking the path. For example, walls at 4 steps right and various up positions. So maybe the path is blocked, and I need to move the walls or rearrange rules to clear the path.

Alternatively, maybe instead of moving the ""win"" rule, I can make ""baba is win"" by moving the ""win"" text block next to Baba. But that might not work because the rules are about objects and their properties. Wait, the rules are in the format ""[Subject] IS [Property]."" So if I can make ""baba IS win,"" then Baba would be win. But the active rule is ""baba is you,"" so I need to replace that. To do that, I need to move the ""you"" rule away and place the ""win"" rule next to Baba. But how?

Looking at the current objects, there's a ""rule `you`"" at 1 step to the right and 1 step down. If I can move that ""you"" rule away and bring the ""win"" rule next to Baba, then ""baba is win"" would be active, making touching anything win. But I need to see if that's possible. The ""you"" rule is 1 step right and 1 down from Baba's position. So if I can move the ""you"" rule, say, to the left, then I can place the ""win"" rule next to Baba.

But first, I need to locate the ""win"" rule. It's at 8 steps right and 5 up. To get there, I might have to move through the map, avoiding walls. However, there are walls at 4 steps right and up to 5 step up, which might block the path. So perhaps I need to move the walls by rearranging rules. For example, if a wall has a ""stop"" property, but in the current active rules, only ""baba is you"" is active. The walls themselves don't have any properties unless specified by rules. The ""wall is stop"" rule is present at 2 step left and 4 step up, but that's a separate rule. So maybe some walls are stop, meaning they can't be moved. But others might not be.

This is getting complicated. Maybe a simpler approach is to focus on reaching the door and changing its rule to ""win."" The door is at 7 steps right and 1 down. If I can make ""door is win,"" then touching it would win. To do that, I need to move the ""win"" rule to the door's location. The ""win"" rule is currently at 8 right and 5 up. So I need to move it left 1 step and down 4 steps. But how? Each move action is single step, so I would have to carry the ""win"" rule while moving.

Assuming I'm near the ""win"" rule, I can pick it up (by moving right and down towards it) and then carry it to the door's position. But the path might be blocked by other objects. Let's see:

Current position of ""win"" rule: 8 right, 5 up. Door is at 7 right, 1 down. So the difference is left 1 and down 4. To move the ""win"" rule there, I need to move it left once and down four times. But each move would require carrying the rule. However, moving the rule requires that the space you're moving it into is not occupied by a ""stop"" object. The walls are at 4 steps right and up to 5, but the path from 8 right,5 up to 7 right,1 down might be clear if there are no stops. Let's check the objects along that path.

Looking at the objects:

- At 4 steps right and 5 up: wall
- 4 right,4 up: wall
- 4 right,3 up: wall
- 4 right,2 up: wall
- 4 right,1 up: wall
- 4 right: wall
- 4 right,1 down: wall

So from 8 right,5 up, moving left to 7 right would be passing through 7 right,5 up. Is there an object there? The ""win"" rule is at 8 right,5 up. The other objects at 7 steps right are the ""key"" at 7 right,1 up, and the ""door"" rule at 7 right,1 down. So the path from 8 right,5 up to 7 right,5 up is possible if there's no wall. But looking at the objects listed, at 4 steps right and up to 5, there are walls, but 7 right,5 up isn't mentioned as a wall. So maybe it's empty. Therefore, moving left from 8 right,5 up to 7 right,5 up is possible.

Then, moving down from 5 up to 1 down would require moving down 4 steps. Each step down from 5 up to 4 up, 3 up, 2 up, 1 up, then down to 1 down. Along the way, at 7 right,4 up is the ""key,"" but that's an object. Can I move through the key? Since the key isn't a stop object, and I'm carrying the ""win"" rule, I can move over it. So the path would be feasible.

Once the ""win"" rule is placed at 7 right,1 down (the door's location), the rule would become ""door is win,"" making touching the door win. Then, moving to the door and touching it would complete the level.

So the steps would be:

1. Move to the ""win"" rule at 8 right,5 up.
2. Pick up the ""win"" rule (by moving adjacent to it).
3. Carry it left to 7 right,5 up.
4. Carry it down 4 steps to 7 right,1 down (the door's location).
5. Place the ""win"" rule there.
6. Move to the door and touch it.

But how to translate this into individual actions? Each action is a single step: up, down, left, right, or idle. Also, to pick up or place a rule, you need to be adjacent to it and move in the direction of the rule. For example, to pick up the ""win"" rule, you need to be next to it and then move in the direction you want to carry it.

In the current observation, the ""win"" rule is 8 steps to the right and 5 steps up from the player's position. Assuming the player is at a certain location, but since the player's position isn't explicitly given, I have to infer based on previous actions. Earlier actions included moving left, right, down, etc. However, without knowing the player's exact position, this is tricky. 

Alternatively, maybe the player is near the ""baba"" rule at 1 step left and 1 step down. So to reach the ""win"" rule at 8 right,5 up, the player would need to move right 9 steps and up 6 steps. But there are walls blocking the path. For example, at 4 steps right and up to 5, there are walls. So the player would have to navigate around them by moving in a different path.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe a better approach is to focus on the immediate surroundings. The latest observation shows that the ""you"" rule is at 1 step to the right and 1 step down from Baba's position. If I can move that ""you"" rule away and bring the ""key"" rule or ""win"" rule next to Baba, I could change the rules.

But the key is at 2 steps right and 4 up. To get there, the player would need to move right and up, but there's a wall at 4 steps right and 4 up. So maybe moving the wall by changing its rule. For example, if there's a ""wall is stop"" rule at 2 step left and 4 step up, perhaps moving that rule away would allow the player to pass through the wall.

Wait, the ""wall is stop"" rule is at 2 step left and 4 step up. If I can move that rule, then the wall at 4 steps right and 4 up wouldn't be stopped, allowing the player to move through it. But how to move that rule? It's a text block, so if it's not stopped, the player can pick it up and move it.

So steps could be:

1. Move to the ""wall is stop"" rule at 2 left and 4 up.
2. Pick it up and move it to a different location, say, to the left or right, so the wall at 4 right,4 up is no longer stopped.
3. Then, move through the wall to reach the key at 2 right,4 up.
4. Use the key to open a door, but there's no locked door mentioned.
5. Alternatively, with the wall not being stopped, move right past it to reach the key.

But this is speculative. Without knowing the player's exact position, it's hard to plan the exact actions. However, based on the latest observation, the ""you"" rule is nearby. Maybe the quickest way is to interact with the ""you"" rule. Since the active rule is ""baba is you,"" perhaps replacing the ""you"" rule with ""win"" next to Baba would make him win.

To do that:

1. Move to the ""you"" rule at 1 step right and 1 step down.
2. Pick it up and move it away.
3. Move to the ""win"" rule at 8 right,5 up.
4. Bring the ""win"" rule next to Baba.
5. Then, the rule would be ""baba is win,"" making touching anything win.

But again, navigating to those positions is challenging due to walls.

Another angle: the door is at 7 right,1 down. If I can make ""door is win,"" then touching it would win. To do that, move the ""win"" rule to the door's location. The ""win"" rule is at 8 right,5 up. So move left once and down four times.

Assuming the player is near the ""baba"" rule at 1 left and 1 down, the path to the ""win"" rule would involve moving right 9 steps and up 6 steps, but walls block that. So alternative path: move right past the walls by rearranging rules.

This is really tricky. Maybe the best immediate action is to move towards the ""win"" rule to pick it up. The latest observation shows the ""win"" rule at 8 right,5 up. If the player is to the left of that, moving right would be the first step. But the player's position isn't clear. Alternatively, since the previous actions were moving left, right, down, and the latest observation shows Baba's rule at 1 left and 1 down, perhaps moving right towards the ""you"" rule first, then down to the door.

Alternatively, the solution could be to move down towards the door, assuming that once the ""win"" rule is moved there, touching it would work. But without changing the rule, the door isn't a win condition.

Given the time I've spent and the need to provide an action, I'll go with moving down towards the door, hoping that once the rule is placed there, it'll work. Alternatively, try to move towards the ""win"" rule to pick it up.

But the latest observation's active rules are still ""baba is you,"" and the door is at 7 right,1 down. If I can move down towards the door, perhaps that's the way to go. The previous actions were moving left, right, down, but the last few attempts resulted in failures. Maybe the correct action is to move down one step to get closer to the door's area.

Let's see. I need to figure out how to progress in this Baba Is You level. The active rule is still ""baba is you,"" which means I can move and interact with text blocks. The goal is usually to reach a ""win"" object, but I know rules can be changed here.

Looking at the objects, there's a key at 2 steps right and 4 up. Maybe I need to get that first to unlock something, but I don't see a lock. There's a door at 1 step left, but the door is probably a ""stop"" because walls are stopping me. Wait, the rules mention ""rule `door` 7 steps to the right and 1 step down."" Hmm, but the active rules are all ""baba is you,"" so unless I change that, doors might be impassable.

The key is at 2 steps right and 4 up. To get there, I need to move up and right. But the path is blocked by walls. Let me check the wall positions. There are walls to the right at 4 steps right and 5 up, decreasing down each step. So from the current position (assuming I'm where ""baba"" is located, which is 1 step left and 1 step down from the top?), moving right into those walls is blocked. Wait, the ""baba"" object is at 1 step left and 1 step down from where? The observation shows ""rule `baba` 1 step to the left and 1 step down,"" so maybe the player is at that position. So the player's position is 1 step left and 1 step down relative to something? Maybe the grid is a bit confusing here.

Alternatively, perhaps the player is at the position of the ""baba"" text block. The ""baba"" rule is at 1 step left and 1 step down. So if I'm at that location, I can move around. Let me try to visualize the map.

Looking at the objects:

- Walls are spread out to the right and up.
- The ""is"" rule is at 8 steps right and 5 up, part of the top wall structure.
- The ""win"" rule is further right and up.
- The key is at 2 right, 4 up. So to reach it, I need to move right twice and up four steps, but the path is blocked by walls at 4 steps right. Wait, the walls at 4 right start at 5 up and go down to 1 up. So from the key's position (2 right, 4 up), moving right would hit the wall at 4 right, 4 up. So perhaps I need to rearrange the rules to remove the wall or create a passage.

The key is under a ""rule `key` 8 steps to the right and 1 step up."" That might be a text block that says ""key is..."" but it's not clear. Wait, the objects listed are the positions of the text blocks and other objects. The ""rule `key`"" at 8 right, 1 up is probably a text block that says ""key IS ..."" something. Since the active rule is ""baba is you,"" I can move that text block.

So maybe I need to move the ""key"" text block to change its rule. For example, if it's ""key is lock,"" then I could pick up the key and unlock a door. But how? Let's see. The key is at 2 right, 4 up. To get there, I need to navigate through the walls. But the path is blocked. Alternatively, maybe I can push the ""is"" rule blocks to create a new rule.

Looking at the ""rule `is`"" blocks at various positions. If I can move an ""is"" block near the key, I could create a new rule like ""key is win"" or something. But to do that, I need to move the ""is"" block. Since ""baba is you,"" I can move any object that isn't ""stop."" The ""stop"" properties are at 1 left, 4 up and 4 up (but the exact positions need checking).

Wait, the ""rule `stop`"" is at 2 step to the left and 4 step up. So that text block says ""stop IS ..."" something. But since the active rule is ""baba is you,"" I can move that ""stop"" text block unless it's defined as stop. Wait, no. The objects that have the ""stop"" property are the ones that can't be moved. So any object that is labeled as ""stop"" in the active rules can't be moved. Let me check the active rules again. The only active rule is ""baba is you,"" so everything else is movable unless they have a ""stop"" property. But the ""rule `stop`"" at 2 left, 4 up is a text block. If that text block says ""stop is wall"" or something, then the wall would be stop. But the active rules don't show ""stop is wall""; the active rule is just ""baba is you."" So maybe the ""stop"" text block is present but not active, so I can move it.

So, to move the ""is"" blocks, I need to get to their positions. Let's see, the player is at the ""baba"" rule's position: 1 step left and 1 step down. So maybe the player's current location is at (assuming center is 0,0), then moving left would be negative x, down would be negative y. So the ""baba"" rule is at x=-1, y=-1. To move right, that's x+1.

The ""rule `is`"" blocks are at 8 right, 5 up (x=8, y=5), 3 right, 1 up (x=3, y=1), etc. To reach these, the player would have to move right and up, but there are walls blocking the path. For example, moving right from x=-1, each step right increases x by 1. But at x=4, there are walls from y=5 down to y=1. So moving right past x=4 is blocked by walls. Unless those walls can be removed by changing rules.

Alternatively, maybe the key is at x=2, y=4. To get there, the player needs to move right twice and up four times. But from x=-1, moving right to x=2 would require passing through x=0,1,2. At x=4, there's a wall, but x=2 is before that. Wait, looking at the walls: ""wall 2 steps to the right and 5 step up"" — that's at x=2, y=5. Then down each step: x=2, y=4 is a wall, x=2, y=3 is a wall, etc. So the key at x=2, y=4 is behind a wall at the same x but lower y. So to get to the key, need to move up to y=4, but the path is blocked by the wall at x=2, y=4. Unless I can push the wall or change the rule.

But since the active rule is ""baba is you,"" I can move the wall's text block if it's not defined as stop. The wall's text block is at 3 step to the left and 4 step up (x=-3, y=4). If I can move that ""wall"" text block, I could change its rule. For example, turning it into ""wall is stop"" or something else. But moving that text block would require navigating to its position.

Alternatively, maybe create a new rule that allows moving through walls. For example, if I can create ""wall is nothing"" or ""you is push,"" but to do that, I need to move an ""is"" text block next to the relevant word.

The key is at x=2, y=4. If I can create a rule like ""key is win,"" then picking up the key would make it a win condition. But to do that, I need to move the ""is"" block at x=3, y=1 to near the key. Let's see. The ""rule `is`"" at x=3, y=1. If I can move that ""is"" block to x=2, y=4 (where the key is), then I could write ""key is win."" But moving that ""is"" block requires moving from x=3, y=1 to x=2, y=4. How?

The player is at x=-1, y=-1. To reach x=3, y=1, need to move right three times and up once. But along the way, at x=4, there are walls blocking. Wait, the walls at x=4 start at y=5 and go down to y=1. So moving right past x=3 to x=4 is blocked by walls. Therefore, can't get to the ""is"" block at x=3, y=1 directly.

Alternative approach: Use the ""is"" block at x=8, y=5 (top right). If I can move that ""is"" block down to near the key. But moving from x=8, y=5 to x=2, y=4 would require going left and down, but again, there are walls at x=4 blocking the path.

Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe another strategy. The ""door"" is at x=1, y=-1 (since it's 1 step left and 1 step down from where? The ""rule `door`"" is at x=7, y=1 (since it's 7 steps to the right and 1 step down). Wait, the observation lists ""rule `door` 6 steps to the right and 1 step down."" So that's x=6, y=-1? Not sure about the coordinate system. Maybe the positions are relative to the player's current location.

Alternatively, perhaps the player is in a grid where each step is relative. The key is at 2 steps right and 4 up from the player's current position. So to get there, move right 2, up 4. But the path is blocked by walls at x=2, y=4 (the key's position is x=2, y=4, but there's a wall there). Wait, the key object is at x=2, y=4, but there's also a wall at x=2, y=4. So how can the key be there? Maybe the wall and key are overlapping? That doesn't make sense. Maybe the key is on top of the wall, but in Baba Is You, objects can be on top of each other. So to get the key, I need to move into the same tile as the key, but the wall is there too. Unless the wall's rule has been changed.

Wait, the active rules only have ""baba is you."" So the wall's behavior is default: it's a stop. So if there's a wall and a key on the same tile, I can't move into that tile because the wall is stop. Therefore, the key is in a tile blocked by a wall. So I can't reach it unless I remove the wall's stop property.

To remove the wall's stop property, I need to change its rule. The wall's rule is at x=-3, y=4 (3 steps to the left and 4 up). If I can move that ""wall"" text block, I can change its definition. For example, changing ""wall is stop"" to ""wall is you,"" but that would make walls movable. Alternatively, changing it to ""wall is nothing.""

But to move the ""wall"" text block at x=-3, y=4, the player needs to navigate there. The player is at x=-1, y=-1. Moving left to x=-3 and up to y=4 would require passing through x=-2, y=0 to y=4. But are there any obstacles? The walls at x=4 are a problem, but x=-3 is to the left, so no walls there. So possible path:

From player's position (x=-1, y=-1):

- Move left to x=-2 (action: left)
- Move left to x=-3 (action: left)
- Move up four times to y=4 (actions: up, up, up, up)

Once at x=-3, y=4, there's the ""rule `wall`"" text block. Since the active rule is ""baba is you,"" I can pick it up and move it. Then, perhaps place it near another text block to create a new rule, like ""wall is nothing.""

But then, where to place it? Maybe next to the ""stop"" text block at x=2 left, y=4 up (which is x=-2, y=4). If I move the ""wall"" text block to near the ""stop"" text block, I could create a rule like ""stop is wall"" or change it.

Alternatively, move the ""is"" text block at x=8, y=5 down to x=-3, y=4 to create ""wall is you"" or similar.

This seems complicated. Maybe a simpler approach: Since the key is at x=2, y=4 behind a wall, perhaps I can create a rule that allows moving through walls. For example, ""you is push"" so I can push the wall aside. But to make ""you is push,"" I need to move the ""is"" text block next to ""you.""

The ""rule `you`"" is at x=1 step to the right and 1 step down from where? The observation shows ""rule `you` 1 step down."" If the player is at x=-1, y=-1, then ""1 step down"" would be y=-2. So the ""you"" rule is at x=-1, y=-2. To get there, move down once. Then, move the ""is"" block from x=3, y=1 to near the ""you"" rule.

But again, pathing is an issue. The player is at x=-1, y=-1. To reach x=-1, y=-2 (the ""you"" rule), move down. Then, move right to x=3, y=-2 (the ""is"" block at x=3, y=1 is actually at x=3, y=1, which is up from the player's current position). Wait, this is getting confusing with the coordinate system.

Alternatively, focus on the ""is"" blocks. There's an ""is"" block at x=8, y=5 (top right). If I can move that ""is"" block down to near the ""key"" or ""win"" rules, maybe I can create a new rule. For example, moving ""is"" to where ""key"" is, making ""key is win.""

But moving the top ""is"" block from x=8, y=5 to x=2, y=4 would require moving left 6 and down 1. The player would have to move right to reach x=8, but the path is blocked by walls at x=4. So that's not feasible.

Another angle: The ""win"" rule is at x=9, y=5. If I can change that to ""baba is win,"" then standing on baba would make it a win. But to do that, I need to move the ""is"" block next to ""baba."" The ""baba"" rule is at x=-1, y=-1 (same as the player's position). So if I can pick up the ""is"" block from x=8, y=5 and place it next to ""baba,"" creating ""baba is win.""

But again, moving from x=8, y=5 to x=-1, y=-1 is blocked by walls at x=4.

This level seems to require rearranging multiple rules, but the path is blocked by walls. Maybe the solution is to use the existing ""is"" blocks to create a rule that overrides the walls. For example, making ""wall is push"" so I can push the walls out of the way.

To make ""wall is push,"" I need to move the ""is"" block next to ""wall."" The ""wall"" text block is at x=-3, y=4. So if I can move the ""is"" block from x=3, y=1 to x=-3, y=4, creating ""wall is push."" Then, I could push the walls to clear a path.

Let's break it down:

1. Player is at x=-1, y=-1.
2. Move left to x=-2, then left to x=-3 (actions: left, left).
3. Move up four times to y=4 (actions: up, up, up, up).
4. Now at x=-3, y=4, there's the ""rule `wall`"" text block. Pick it up (though in the game, you move the text block by walking on it and then moving in a direction, which places it elsewhere).
5. Move to the ""is"" block at x=3, y=1. To get there, need to go right from x=-3 to x=3, but the path is blocked by walls at x=4. So impossible unless walls are moved.

This is a dead end. Alternative approach: Use the ""is"" block at x=8, y=5. If I can move it down to x=3, y=1 (where another ""is"" block is), but again, path is blocked.

Wait, the ""is"" block at x=3, y=1 is near the key area. If I can move that ""is"" block to near the key, maybe create ""key is win.""

But to reach x=3, y=1 from the player's position:

- Move right three times (x=-1 → 0 → 1 → 2 → 3), but x=4 is blocked. So can't get past x=3.

This level is frustrating. Maybe the solution is to push the ""door"" rule to change its behavior. The door is at x=7, y=1 (rule `door` 6 steps to the right and 1 step down). If I can make the door be something passable, like ""door is you"" or ""door is win.""

To do that, need to move the ""is"" block next to the door's rule. The ""door"" rule is at x=7, y=1. The nearest ""is"" block is at x=8, y=5 (top right). Moving that down to x=7, y=1 would create ""door is [something].""

But moving from x=8, y=5 to x=7, y=1 requires moving left once and down four times. The player would have to go from x=-1, y=-1 to x=8, y=5, which is impossible due to walls at x=4.

Another idea: The key is at x=2, y=4. If I can make the key a pushable object, then maybe I can move it out of the way. But","

99,down,"<reasoning>
Let's try to figure out what action to take here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" meaning that whatever Baba does, I can do. Looking at the objects, there's a key 2 steps to the right and 4 steps up. There's also a door at 1 step to the left and another door at 7 steps to the right and 1 step down. The goal is usually to reach the ""win"" object, but since the active rules still say ""baba is you,"" I need to see if there's a way to change the win condition or make myself something else.

Wait, the rules mention ""win"" is a rule 8 steps to the right and 5 steps up. But right now, the active rules haven't been changed yet. So maybe the win condition is still a wall or something else. Let me check the objects again. There's a ""rule 'win' 8 steps to the right and 5 step up,"" which probably means that the actual win object is at that position, but it's defined as a rule. To reach it, I need to either move there directly or change the rules.

But the walls are blocking the way. The key is at 2 steps right and 4 up. Maybe I need to get the key first. However, moving towards the key might be possible if the path isn't blocked. Wait, the walls are 4 steps to the right in various positions. Let me visualize the map. Baba is probably at a starting position, and the doors are obstacles. The rule 'is' blocks at 8 steps right and 5 up, which is where the win rule is. So maybe moving right towards the win rule is the goal, but the path is blocked by walls.

Alternatively, the key might be necessary to unlock a door. But there's no lock mentioned here. The 'stop' rule is at 4 steps up, which makes those walls immovable. So perhaps I need to manipulate the rules. Since ""baba is you,"" I can pick up text blocks. The rule 'is' is at 8 steps right and 5 up. If I can move that 'is' rule to redefine something else, like making 'baba' 'win' or 'door' 'you,' that could help.

Looking at the current objects, there's a 'rule 'is' 3 steps to the right and 1 step up.' Maybe I can move that 'is' to combine with another rule. For example, if I can make ""baba is win"" by moving the 'is' next to 'baba' and 'win.' The win rule is 8 steps right and 5 up, which is far away. Alternatively, the 'you' rule is at 1 step to the right and 1 step down. If I can make 'baba' 'you' again, but it's already 'baba is you.'

Wait, the active rule is still ""baba is you,"" so maybe I just need to move towards the 'win' rule. But the path is blocked by walls. The only way past the walls is if they're not 'stop' or similar. The 'stop' rule is at 4 steps up, so the walls there are immovable. The other walls are further right. Maybe there's a way around by moving down or left.

Looking at the current position of Baba: the objects show ""rule `baba` 1 step to the left and 1 step down."" So Baba is located at a position 1 step left and 1 step down from where the 'baba' rule is. Wait, maybe Baba's position is relative to the 'baba' rule text block. If I can move the 'baba' rule, then Baba's position changes. For example, moving the 'baba' rule to the same spot as the 'win' rule would make ""baba is win,"" making Baba the win condition.

But how to move the 'baba' rule? The 'baba' rule is at 1 step to the left and 1 step down. To pick it up, I need to move towards it. The possible actions are moving up, down, left, right, or idle. Since the last few actions were left, down, etc., maybe I need to adjust direction.

The 'baba' rule is 1 step left and 1 step down from the current position. So if I move left once, then down once, I can pick up the 'baba' rule. But I have to check if the path is clear. The walls are at 4 steps right, so if I'm moving left, I might be moving away from the walls. Alternatively, moving down from the current position could lead to the 'you' rule at 1 step down.

Wait, the 'you' rule is 1 step to the right and 1 step down. So if I move down from my current position (which is 1 step left and 1 step down from the 'baba' rule), moving down again would put me at the 'you' rule's position. But can I move there? The 'you' rule is a movable text block unless it's under a 'stop' property. The 'stop' rule is at 4 steps up, so it's not affecting this area. So moving down to the 'you' rule and then picking it up might help.

Alternatively, moving left to the 'baba' rule's position, then pick it up, and move it to the 'win' rule's location. But the 'win' rule is 8 steps right and 5 up, which is quite far. Maybe there's a closer 'win' rule? No, the observation shows only one 'win' rule at 9 steps to the right and 5 up.

Another approach: Since ""baba is you,"" perhaps I can make myself ""win"" by combining the 'baba' text with the 'win' text using the 'is' rule. To do that, I need to move the 'is' rule next to 'baba' and 'win.' The 'is' rule is at 8 steps right and 5 up (the same as the 'win' rule's position), but that's where the 'win' rule is. Alternatively, there's another 'is' rule at 3 steps right and 1 step up. Maybe moving that 'is' rule to connect 'baba' and 'win.'

But how to move the 'is' rule? If I can get to the position of the 'is' rule at 3 steps right and 1 step up, then pick it up and move it to between 'baba' and 'win.' The problem is navigating past the walls. The walls are at 4 steps right in various positions, making the right side blocked. Maybe moving left towards the 'is' rule at 3 steps right and 1 step up.

So the plan would be: move left from the current position to reach the 'is' rule, then move it to combine with 'baba' and 'win.' But first, need to figure out the current position of Baba. The 'baba' rule is at 1 step left and 1 step down. Assuming Baba is at that position, to get to the 'is' rule at 3 steps right and 1 step up, I need to move right 4 times and up 1 time. But the walls at 4 steps right might block that path.

Looking at the walls: there are walls at 4 steps right and 5 up, 4 up, 4 steps right and 4 up, etc. So moving right towards 4 steps right would hit a wall. Maybe there's another path. Alternatively, moving down to the 'you' rule and then right?

This is getting complicated. Maybe the simplest action is to move left towards the 'baba' rule to pick it up and then rearrange the rules. Alternatively, move down to the 'you' rule to pick that up and combine it with something else.

Given the previous failed actions, maybe the system is expecting a specific sequence. The last valid action was 'down,' but then it failed again. Perhaps the correct action now is to move right towards the key or towards the 'is' rule. But given the wall at 4 steps right, moving right might not be possible.

Wait, the key is at 2 steps right and 4 up. If I can move up and right towards the key, but there's a wall at 4 steps right, which is further right. So maybe moving up 4 steps and right 2 steps would reach the key. But the path might be blocked by walls at 3 steps right and 4 up, etc.

Alternatively, since the 'is' rule is at 3 steps right and 1 step up, maybe moving there. To get there from the current position (assuming current position is where the 'baba' rule is, 1 step left and 1 step down), moving right 4 steps and up 1 step. But the wall at 4 steps right would block that. So perhaps moving up first to avoid the wall.

This is really tricky. Maybe the best action is to move right towards the 'is' rule at 3 steps right and 1 step up, but since there's a wall at 4 steps right, perhaps moving up and then right. For example, move up once to get past the wall at 4 steps right? Wait, the walls are at 4 steps right and various up positions. So moving up from the current position (which is 1 step left and 1 step down) would be towards higher up positions. The 'is' rule is at 3 steps right and 1 step up. So moving right 3 steps and up 1 step. But the wall at 4 steps right might be in the way. Maybe there's a gap.

Alternatively, the system might expect me to move down towards the 'you' rule and pick it up, then move it to combine with 'baba' and 'win.' So moving down once to reach the 'you' rule, then picking it up and moving it to the 'is' position to create a new rule like ""you is win"" or something.

But given the repeated failures, perhaps the correct action now is to move down again to get to the 'you' rule. Or maybe left to reach the 'baba' rule. Let me try to decide.

The current active rule is ""baba is you,"" so Baba can move any movable text block not blocked by 'stop.' The 'you' rule is at 1 step to the right and 1 step down. So if I move down from my current position (which is 1 step left and 1 step down relative to the 'baba' rule), moving down once would place me at the 'you' rule's position. Then I can pick it up and move it to the 'win' rule's location to make ""you is win,"" making the player (Baba) able to reach the win condition by being 'you' and 'win.'

So the action would be to move down to pickup the 'you' rule, then move it to the 'win' rule. But the problem is that each action is a single step. So first, move down to get to the 'you' rule. That's the next step.
