Let's try to figure out how to solve this Baba Is You level. The goal is usually to reach a WIN object, but the current rules say ""key is win"", so the key is what we need to get to. Right now, the player (Baba) is probably in a position to interact with the text blocks. The active rules are ""key is win"", ""wall is stop"", and ""baba is you"".

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key located at 8 steps to the right and 1 step up. But there are walls blocking the path. Let me visualize the layout. The walls are all along the right side, starting from 4 steps right and 4 up down to 1 step down. The key is behind some walls, specifically at (8 right, 1 up). To get there, Baba needs to move right past the walls, but the walls are marked as 'stop', which makes them immovable. So the challenge is to remove the 'stop' property from the walls or find a way around using the rules.

The available text blocks on the map include ""door"" at (7 right, 2 up). Maybe if I can create a ""DOOR IS OPEN"" rule, then the door wouldn't block the path. But first, I need to move the existing text blocks to form new rules. The key is to manipulate the rules by moving 'is' and other properties.

The rule ""wall is stop"" is important. If I can change this to ""wall is push"" or ""wall is nothing"", that would make the walls passable. However, moving text blocks that are part of active rules might be tricky. The 'stop' rule is at (1 left, 3 up) for the wall. To alter this, I might need to move the 'stop' block to another position, possibly combining it with 'is' and another subject.

Looking at the available rules: there's a ""door"" rule at (7 right, 2 up), and also ""rule `is`"" blocks at various positions. The idea is to create a new rule that changes the behavior of walls. For example, if I can make ""wall is you"", then I could move the walls myself. Alternatively, changing ""baba is you"" to ""baba is key"" might let me pick up the key directly.

Wait, the current active rules are key is win, wall is stop, and baba is you. So the player is Baba. To get to the key, which is win, but the path is blocked by walls. Let me check the positions again. The key is 8 right, 1 up. The walls are at 4 right, varying up and down. So the key is to the right of the walls. To reach it, Baba needs to move right past the walls at 4 right, but those are stop. So maybe the solution is to turn the walls into something else.

Possible steps:
1. Move the 'is' block near the wall's stop rule. The wall's stop rule is at (1 left, 3 up) and (3 up) for another 'is'? Wait, the objects list shows:
- rule `wall` 1 step to the left and 3 step up
- rule `is` 3 step up
- rule `stop` 1 step to the right and 3 step up

So the existing rule ""wall is stop"" is formed by the wall text block at (1 left, 3 up), the 'is' at (3 up), and 'stop' at (1 right, 3 up). To change this rule, I need to move one of these blocks. For example, if I move the 'stop' block to another position, perhaps combining it with a different property.

Looking at the other rule blocks, there's a ""door"" rule at (7 right, 2 up). Maybe combining door with 'is' and another property. But how does that help with the walls?

Alternatively, if I can create a ""WALL IS PUSH"", then I could move the walls out of the way. To do that, I need to have the necessary text blocks. Let's see: there's a rule `is` at (8 right, 4 up), which is near the key. Maybe I can move the 'wall' block from (1 left, 3 up) to a position where it's combined with 'is' and 'push'.

But first, I need to reach those text blocks. The player (Baba) is probably at a starting position, maybe at (4 right, 4 up) based on the walls' positions. Let me assume the player is at (4 right, 4 up) since there's a wall there. To move right, the next position would be 5 right, 4 up, but that's a wall (stop). So moving right directly is blocked.

Wait, the objects list includes a ball at (5 right, 3 up). Maybe the player is near there. Alternatively, the player's position isn't explicitly listed, but the rules and objects are. Maybe I need to figure out where Baba is. Since ""baba is you"" is an active rule, Baba must be an object on the map. Looking at the objects, there's a ""rule `baba`"" at (1 left, 2 steps down). That's a text block, not the actual Baba object. The actual Baba is probably elsewhere. Hmm, maybe the player's position is inferred from the map layout. This is getting a bit complicated.

Alternatively, let's focus on the available text blocks. To change ""wall is stop"" to ""wall is push"", I need to move the 'stop' block to another part of the rule. The current 'wall is stop' rule is at positions (1 left, 3 up) for 'wall', (3 up) for 'is', and (1 right, 3 up) for 'stop'. If I can move the 'stop' block to a different location, say next to 'wall' and 'push', then the rule would change. But where is the 'push' text block? There isn't one mentioned. So maybe create a new rule using existing blocks.

Alternatively, maybe use the 'door' rule. If I can make ""door is key"" or something, but not sure. Another approach: if I can make Baba into the key, then picking up the key would automatically make him win. Since ""key is win"", if Baba becomes the key, then ""baba is win"" would be true. So how to do that? The current rules have ""baba is you"" and ""key is win"". To make ""baba is key"", I need to move the 'baba' text block next to 'is' and 'key'.

The 'baba' rule is at (1 left, 2 steps down), 'is' is at (2 steps down), and 'key' is part of the ""key is win"" rule at (7 right, 4 up). So perhaps moving the 'baba' block to be next to 'is' and 'key' would create the rule ""baba is key"", making Baba into the key. Then, since ""key is win"", Baba would be win. That seems possible.

So the steps would be:
1. Move the 'baba' rule (text block) to be adjacent to 'is' and 'key'.
2. This would create the rule ""baba is key"", making the player (Baba) the key, which is win.

But how to do that in movement? The player needs to move the 'baba' text block. Since ""baba is you"", the player can move any object that's not stop. The 'baba' rule is a text block, so if it's not under a 'stop' property, can the player move it?

Looking at the active rules: ""wall is stop"", but the 'baba' rule is at (1 left, 2 down). Are there any stop properties affecting it? The walls are at 4 right, so the 'baba' rule is probably in a passable area. So the player can move the 'baba' text block.

To move the 'baba' block to the area where 'is' and 'key' are, let's see their positions. The 'is' block is at (2 steps down), and the 'key' rule is at (7 right, 4 up). That's quite far. Alternatively, maybe there's a closer 'is' block. There's another 'is' at (8 right, 4 up), near the key. So if the player can move the 'baba' block to the left of that 'is' and below the 'key' block, then they can form ""baba is key"".

But the distances are significant. The 'baba' rule is at (1 left, 2 down), and the 'key' is at (7 right, 4 up). Moving the 'baba' block all the way there in one step isn't possible. Maybe the player needs to move in a specific direction first.

Alternatively, perhaps the solution is simpler. Since the key is at (8 right, 1 up), and the player needs to get there. If the player can make the walls pushable, they could move the walls aside. But to do that, they need to change the ""wall is stop"" rule to ""wall is push"". To do that, they need to rearrange the text blocks forming that rule.

The current ""wall is stop"" rule is composed of the wall block at (1 left, 3 up), 'is' at (3 up), and 'stop' at (1 right, 3 up). If the player can move the 'stop' block to a different position, say next to 'wall' and 'push', but there's no 'push' block. Alternatively, swap 'stop' with another property. For example, if they move 'stop' to where 'door' is, but not sure.

Alternatively, create a new rule ""wall is you"", making the walls movable. To do that, the player needs to have the 'wall' text block, 'is', and 'you' adjacent. The 'you' block is at (1 right, 2 down). The 'wall' block is at (1 left, 3 up). So if the player can move the 'wall' block to be next to 'is' and 'you', forming ""wall is you"". Then the walls would be movable.

But moving the 'wall' block from (1 left, 3 up) to where? Let's see. The 'is' block is at (3 up), which is probably in the middle. The 'you' block is at (1 right, 2 down). The path between them might be blocked by walls. This could be complicated.

Another angle: since the key is win, and the player needs to reach it. If the player can turn themselves into the key, that would solve it. As mentioned earlier, creating ""baba is key"" would make the player the key, hence win. To do this, the player needs to move the 'baba' text block next to 'is' and 'key'.

The 'baba' rule is at (1 left, 2 down). The 'is' block is at (2 steps down). The 'key' is part of the ""key is win"" rule at (7 right, 4 up). So perhaps moving the 'baba' block to the left of the 'is' block and below the 'key' block. But the distances are large. Maybe the player can move in a direction that allows them to reach those blocks step by step.

Alternatively, maybe the player is already adjacent to some important blocks. For example, if the player is near the 'baba' rule text block, they can move it. Let's assume the player's position is at (0,0) for simplicity, but given the walls are at 4 right, maybe the player is at (4 right, 4 up), a wall. Wait, the walls are at 4 right, 4 up; 4 right, 3 up; etc. So the player can't be there. Maybe the player is to the left of the walls. For example, at (3 right, 4 up), but need to check.

This is getting a bit too ambiguous without seeing the actual map layout. But based on the object positions, the key is to the east, blocked by walls. The solution likely involves either moving the walls by changing their rule or becoming the key.

Given the time constraints, the most straightforward solution might be to turn the player into the key. So the steps would be:

1. Move the 'baba' text block (at 1 left, 2 down) to the area where 'is' and 'key' are. The 'is' is at 2 down, and 'key' is at 7 right, 4 up. This requires moving the 'baba' block to the right and up. But how?

Alternatively, there's a 'rule `is`' at (8 right, 4 up), near the key. If the player can move the 'baba' block next to that 'is' and below the 'key' block, forming ""baba is key"". 

The 'baba' rule is at (1 left, 2 down). To get it to (8 right, 4 up), the player would need to move right 9 steps and up 2 steps, which isn't feasible in one move. But maybe the player can move in steps. For example, move right until they are at 4 right (but that's a wall), then find another path.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a closer 'is' block. The 'is' at (3 up) is at (4 right, 3 up)? Not sure. This is getting too confusing without the actual grid.

Another approach: look for existing rules that can be broken. The active rules are key is win, wall is stop, baba is you. If the player can make ""stop is you"", then the walls would no longer be stop. But how?

Alternatively, create ""wall is push"" by moving the 'wall' block, 'is', and 'push' (but there's no push block). Alternatively, use the 'door' rule. If the player can make ""door is key"", then stepping on door gives key, but the key is already win.

Alternatively, move the 'key' block to be next to 'win', but it's already ""key is win"".

Hmm. Maybe the solution is to move the 'stop' block from the wall rule to somewhere else. For example, if the player can move the 'stop' block to form a new rule like ""stop is lose"", then walls wouldn't be stop. But where is the 'lose' block? Not present.

Alternatively, if the player can make ""baba is stop"", but that would make the player stop, which is bad.

Wait, the player is Baba, and ""baba is you"". If the player can change ""baba is you"" to ""baba is key"", then since ""key is win"", the player becomes win. To do that, the player needs to move the 'baba' text block next to 'is' and 'key'.

The 'baba' text block is at (1 left, 2 down). The 'is' blocks are at (3 up) and (8 right, 4 up). The 'key' is at (7 right, 4 up). So perhaps moving the 'baba' block to the left of the 'is' at (8 right, 4 up) and below the 'key' at (7 right, 4 up). That would form ""baba is key"".

To move the 'baba' block from (1 left, 2 down) to (7 right, 4 up), the player needs to move right and up. But the path might be blocked by walls. For example, moving right from (1 left, 2 down) to (4 right, 2 down) is a wall. So maybe the player needs to move up first.

Alternatively, the player can move up to (1 left, 1 down), then right to (4 right, 1 down), but that's a wall. This is tricky.

Alternatively, maybe the player can move the 'is' block instead. The 'is' at (8 right, 4 up) is near the key. If the player moves that 'is' block next to 'baba' and 'key', that would work. But the 'is' block is at (8 right, 4 up), and the 'baba' block is at (1 left, 2 down). The distance is large.

Alternatively, use the 'rule `is`' at (3 up). If the player can move that 'is' block to be next to 'baba' and 'key', but again, distance is an issue.

This is quite challenging. Maybe I should consider the immediate possible moves. The player needs to reach the text blocks to rearrange them. Let's look at the positions again:

- rule `baba` is at 1 step left and 2 steps down from somewhere.
- rule `is` is at 3 steps up and 8 steps right, 4 up.
- key is at 8 right, 1 up.

Assuming the player is near the 'baba' rule text block, they can move it. For example, if the player is at (0,0), moving left would take them to the 'baba' rule at (1 left, 2 down). Then moving right and up to reach the 'is' and 'key' blocks.

But without knowing the exact starting position, it's hard to say. Maybe the best action is to move right towards the 'key' and see if the path clears. But the walls are stop, so movement is blocked.

Wait, another idea: if the player can turn the wall into a door, then maybe they can walk through it. For example, create ""wall is door"", but doors are usually stop unless opened. Not sure.

Alternatively, create ""door is you"", then move into the door. But the door's rule is at (7 right, 2 up). If the player can make ""door is you"", they could move through it. But how?

This is taking too long. Let's try to summarize:

Key points:
- Goal is key (since key is win).
- Path blocked by walls (stop).
- Need to change wall's rule or become key.

Possible solution: Make ""baba is key"" by moving 'baba' text block next to 'is' and 'key'.

To do that, player needs to move 'baba' block. Assuming the player is near the 'baba' rule, the action could be to move right or up towards the 'is' and 'key' blocks.

Given the available actions (up, down, left, right, idle), the immediate action might be to move right towards the key's general direction, but considering the walls.

Alternatively, move up to reach higher ground where text blocks are located.

But without knowing the player's exact position, it's a gamble. However, based on the objects listed, the 'baba' rule is at (1 left,","

Let's see. My goal is to get to the key, right? Because the active rule says ""key is win,"" so touching the key would make me win. But wait, normally ""baba is you,"" so I'm Baba. The walls are stop, which means I can't move through them.

Looking at the map, the key is located at 8 steps right and 1 step up. But between me (Baba) and the key, there's a wall at 4 steps right and 1 step up. So I can't go straight there. Maybe I need to move some rules to change the properties of the wall or the key.

First, let's check where the rules are. There's a ""wall is stop"" rule at 1 left and 3 up. If I can change that rule, maybe I can make the wall not stop. But how? To move a text block, I have to be next to it, right? And I can only move things that aren't stop. So let's see where I am. Looking at the objects, Baba is at 1 left and 2 steps down. Wait, the rule ""baba is you"" is at 1 left and 2 steps down. So maybe I'm next to that rule? No, the rule itself is an object. So to move the ""baba is you"" rule, I need to be adjacent to it. But my position isn't clear from the description. Maybe I need to figure out where I am.

Wait, the observation lists objects, including walls and rules. The active rules are key is win, wall is stop, and baba is you. The key is at 8 right, 1 up. The walls are in a line to the right. The ball is at 5 right, 3 up. The door is a rule at 7 right, 2 up. 

Assuming I'm Baba, my position might be where the ""baba"" rule is located, which is 1 left and 2 down. So I'm at (1 left, 2 down). To get to the key at (8 right, 1 up), I need to move right multiple times, but there are walls blocking the path. The walls at 4 right, 4 up; 4 right, 3 up; etc. So maybe I need to manipulate the rules to bypass them.

The ""wall is stop"" rule is at 1 left and 3 up. If I can change that to something else, like ""wall is push"" or ""wall is nothing,"" then I could move through the walls. But to do that, I need to move the ""wall is stop"" rule. To move a text block, I have to be adjacent to it and not be stopped by any properties. Let's see where the ""wall is stop"" rule is. It's 1 step left and 3 steps up from the current position (assuming I'm at 1 left, 2 down). So from my position, moving up once would get me to the same column as the ""wall is stop"" rule, which is 1 left, 3 up. Wait, maybe I can move up and then right to reach that rule.

Alternatively, maybe I can rearrange the ""key is win"" rule to make the key into something else. But the key is already the win condition. Hmm.

Another approach: Since ""baba is you,"" I can move around. Let's see if there's a way to reach the key by moving through other areas. The key is at 8 right, 1 up. There's a wall at 4 right, 1 up. So between me (assuming position is 1 left, 2 down) and the key, moving right 4 steps would hit the wall. So I need to find a way around.

What if I move the ""wall is stop"" rule to somewhere else, like next to a wall, making that wall not stop? For example, if I move ""wall is stop"" to be attached to the key, then the key would become stop, which isn't helpful. Or maybe attach it to the door? Wait, the door is a rule at 7 right, 2 up. If I make the door stop, then maybe I can use it as a path. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe create a new rule that allows me to pass through walls. For example, if I can make ""baba can go through stop,"" but I need to have the right text blocks. The existing rules are ""baba is you,"" ""key is win,"" and ""wall is stop."" The text blocks available are in the map: there's a ""is"" rule at 8 right, 4 up, and others. Maybe I need to combine ""baba"", ""is"", and ""can go through stop"" or similar. But I don't see the ""can go through"" text block. Hmm.

Wait, the available rules on the map include ""is"" blocks. Let me check the objects again. The rules present are:

- key is win (7 right,4 up), is (8 right,4 up), win (9 right,4 up)

- wall is stop (1 left,3 up), is (3 up), stop (1 right,3 up)

- door rule at 7 right,2 up

- baba is you at 1 left,2 down, is at 2 down, you at 1 right,2 down.

So the text blocks available are ""baba"", ""is"", ""you"", ""key"", ""win"", ""wall"", ""stop"", ""door"".

To create a new rule, I need to move these text blocks together. For example, if I can move ""baba"", ""is"", and ""not stop"" somewhere, but I don't have a ""not stop"" block. Alternatively, change ""wall is stop"" to ""wall is push"" by rearranging the existing blocks. But the ""push"" text block isn't present. Hmm.

Alternatively, create a rule that says ""stop is nothing"", which would make stops non-blocking. But again, the ""nothing"" block isn't here. So maybe that's not possible.

Wait, the current active rules are key is win, wall is stop, and baba is you. So if I can change ""wall is stop"" to ""wall is you"", then walls would be controllable. Let's see. The ""wall is stop"" rule is made of ""wall"", ""is"", ""stop"". To change it, I need to replace ""stop"" with another property. But the text blocks available are ""you"", ""key"", ""win"", etc. So if I can move the ""stop"" block from the wall rule to another place and replace it with ""you"", then the rule would be ""wall is you"", making walls controllable. But how?

The ""stop"" rule is at 1 right,3 up. So if I can move that ""stop"" block elsewhere, then take it and put it into the wall rule. Let's see. My position is at 1 left,2 down. To get to the ""stop"" block at 1 right,3 up, I need to move right twice and up once. But the path might be blocked. Let's check the path:

From 1 left,2 down:

- Move right once to 0 left,2 down. Is there anything there? The objects listed don't mention anything at that position. Then move right again to 1 right,2 down. Again, no objects mentioned. Then up once to 1 right,3 up, which is the ""stop"" rule. So that path is possible.

Once I'm next to the ""stop"" rule, I can take it (since it's a text block, not stop unless the rule says so). Then, go to the ""wall is stop"" rule at 1 left,3 up. Wait, the ""wall is stop"" rule is at 1 left,3 up. So from the ""stop"" block at 1 right,3 up, I need to move left to 1 left,3 up, which is where the wall rule is. Then, replace the ""stop"" in the wall rule with the moved ""stop"" block? Wait, no. The wall rule is three blocks: ""wall"", ""is"", ""stop"". To change it, I need to replace the ""stop"" with another property. But I have the ""stop"" block in my hand now. Maybe I can create a new rule by combining ""wall"", ""is"", and another property.

Alternatively, if I take the ""stop"" block and move it to another location, then use the ""you"" block to replace it. The ""you"" block is at 1 right,2 down. So from my position at 1 left,2 down, I can move right to 1 right,2 down (the ""you"" block), take that, then go to the ""wall is stop"" rule at 1 left,3 up, and replace ""stop"" with ""you"". But this requires moving multiple steps and ensuring I can pick up the blocks.

Alternatively, maybe the key is at 8 right,1 up. If I can make the key not stop, then I could push it or move it. But the key's rule is ""key is win"", so unless I change that, it's still win. If I could make ""key is you"", then I could move the key myself. But to do that, I need to rearrange the text blocks to form ""key is you"".

The ""key"" rule is at 7 right,4 up, followed by ""is"" at 8 right,4 up, and ""win"" at 9 right,4 up. So the ""key is win"" rule is a horizontal trio. To change it to ""key is you"", I would need to replace ""win"" with ""you"". But the ""you"" block is at 1 right,2 down, which is quite far. So the steps would be: move to the ""you"" block, take it, then go to the ""key is win"" rule and replace ""win"" with ""you"". That would make ""key is you"", allowing me to move the key.

But how to do that? Let's outline the steps:

1. Move from current position (assuming 1 left,2 down) to the ""you"" block at 1 right,2 down.

   - Right once to 0 left,2 down.

   - Right again to 1 right,2 down. Now holding ""you"".

2. Then move to the ""key is win"" rule at 7 right,4 up.

   - From 1 right,2 down, need to go up 2 steps to reach 4 up.

   - Up twice: 1 right,4 down (assuming directions are relative). Wait, directions might be up, down, left, right from the current position. So moving up from 1 right,2 down would be 1 right,1 down, then 1 right,0 down (which is 1 right, up?), maybe the coordinate system is a bit unclear. Alternatively, perhaps the positions are relative to Baba's location. This part is a bit confusing. Let me assume that moving up from 1 right,2 down takes me to 1 right,1 up, then 1 right,2 up, etc. But the key is at 8 right,1 up. So this path might be complicated.

Alternatively, maybe the key is to the right and above, so I need to move right and up. But there are walls blocking the way. 

Alternatively, if I can make the walls passable by changing their rule. Let's get back to the earlier idea of changing ""wall is stop"" to ""wall is you"". To do that, I need to take the ""stop"" block from the ""wall is stop"" rule and replace it with ""you"".

So:

1. Move to the ""stop"" block at 1 right,3 up.

   - From 1 left,2 down: right twice (to 0 left, then 1 right), up once. So position 1 right,3 up. Now holding ""stop"".

2. Move to the ""wall is stop"" rule at 1 left,3 up.

   - From 1 right,3 up: left once to 1 left,3 up. Now at the ""wall is stop"" rule. The rule is made of three blocks: ""wall"" at 1 left,3 up, ""is"" at some position, and ""stop"" at 1 right,3 up. Wait, the ""wall is stop"" rule is probably arranged as three adjacent blocks: wall, is, stop. So if I'm at the ""wall"" part (1 left,3 up), and I have the ""stop"" block in hand, I can replace the existing ""stop"" with the new one. But how does that work? By moving the ""stop"" block next to ""wall is"", making it ""wall is you"" if I replace ""stop"" with ""you"".

Alternatively, perhaps by moving the ""stop"" block away and placing ""you"" there. But this requires understanding of how text blocks are linked.

Alternatively, create a new rule ""wall is you"" by combining ""wall"", ""is"", and ""you"". Since I have the ""you"" block already (from step 1), if I can get the ""wall"" and ""is"" blocks together with ""you"", that would work.

The ""wall"" rule is part of the ""wall is stop"" rule at 1 left,3 up. So the ""wall"" block is there, followed by ""is"" at 3 up, then ""stop"" at 1 right,3 up. To create ""wall is you"", I need to replace the ""stop"" with ""you"". So if I take the ""stop"" block and move it somewhere else, then place the ""you"" block in its place.

So steps:

1. Take the ""stop"" block from 1 right,3 up.

2. Move to the ""wall is stop"" rule area. The ""is"" block is at 3 step up, which might be in the same column. So from 1 right,3 up, move left to 1 left,3 up (the ""wall"" part), then place the ""you"" block next to ""is"".

But I'm not sure about the exact positions. This is getting complicated. Maybe a simpler approach: if I can make myself ""win"" instead of the key, then touching anything would win. But the rule is ""key is win"", so unless I change that, it's not possible. To change ""key is win"" to ""baba is win"", I would need to rearrange those blocks. The ""key is win"" rule is at 7 right,4 up, with ""is"" at 8 right,4 up and ""win"" at 9 right,4 up. So if I can replace ""key"" with ""baba"", that would make ""baba is win"". But the ""baba"" block is at 1 left,2 down. So steps:

1. Take the ""baba"" block from 1 left,2 down.

2. Move to the ""key is win"" rule at 7 right,4 up.

3. Replace ""key"" with ""baba"", making ""baba is win"".

But this would require moving the ""baba"" block next to the ""is"" and ""win"" blocks. However, ""baba"" is currently part of the ""baba is you"" rule. If I move the ""baba"" block, does that break the existing rule? Yes, because ""baba is you"" would no longer be a valid rule if the ""baba"" block is moved. So I would have to recreate the ""baba is you"" rule elsewhere. This might complicate things.

Alternatively, create a new rule ""baba is win"" and keep the existing ""key is win"" as well. Then, since I'm baba, touching either the key or myself would win. But I need to have both rules active. However, the game might not allow duplicate rules, but I'm not sure. If I can create ""baba is win"" alongside ""key is win"", then touching either the key or Baba would work. To do that, I need to move the ""baba"" block, ""is"" block, and ""win"" block together.

But this is getting too involved. Let's think differently. The key is at 8 right,1 up. There's a wall at 4 right,1 up. If I can make that wall not stop, I can move through it. To make the wall not stop, I need to change the ""wall is stop"" rule. How?

The ""wall is stop"" rule is made of three blocks: wall, is, stop. If I can replace the ""stop"" with another property, like ""you"", then the rule becomes ""wall is you"", making walls controllable. To do that, I need to take the ""stop"" block from the rule and replace it with ""you"".

So:

1. Move to the ""stop"" block at 1 right,3 up.

   - From Baba's position (1 left,2 down), move right twice (to 0 left, then 1 right) and up once. Now at 1 right,3 up, holding ""stop"".

2. Move to the ""wall is stop"" rule area. The ""wall"" part is at 1 left,3 up, ""is"" at 3 up, and ""stop"" at 1 right,3 up. To replace the ""stop"" with ""you"", I need to place the ""you"" block there. The ""you"" block is at 1 right,2 down. So from 1 right,3 up, move left to 1 left,3 up, then place the ""you"" block next to the ""is"".

But how exactly? Maybe by moving the ""stop"" block out of the way and placing ""you"" in its place. Once that's done, the rule becomes ""wall is you"", so walls are controllable. Then, I can move through the walls.

Once walls are passable, I can go around them to the key. The path would be: from 1 left,2 down, move right past the walls. Since walls are no longer stop, I can pass through them. So move right four times to reach the key's position at 8 right,1 up. But wait, the key is at 8 right,1 up. There's a wall at 4 right,1 up, but if walls are passable, I can move through it. So right, right, right, right, right (from 1 left to 8 right), and up once to 1 up. Then I'm at the key's location, which is a win.

So the steps would be:

- Change ""wall is stop"" to ""wall is you"" by replacing ""stop"" with ""you"".

- Then move right past the walls to the key.

But how to physically move the blocks? The action needs to be one of the movements: up, down, left, right, or idle.

Assuming I need to execute this step by step, the first action should be to move towards the ""stop"" block to pick it up. From Baba's initial position","

Your previous output did not contain a valid action. Defaulted to action: idle

Let's see. The current rules are key is win, wall is stop, and baba is you. So, normally, I'm Baba, which means I can move around unless there's a wall (which is stop). The goal is to reach the key, but since key is win, touching the key would make me win. There's a key at 8 steps right and 1 step up. The problem is the path to the key is blocked by walls. Let me check the map again.

Looking at the objects, there's a wall at 4 right and 1 up, then the key is at 8 right and 1 up. So between me (Baba's position isn't specified here, but the rules have a rule `baba` at 1 left and 2 down. So I'm at 1 left, 2 down. To get to the key, I need to go right towards 4 right, but there are walls at 4 right, 4 right and 1 up, etc. The walls are immovable because wall is stop. So moving directly isn't possible.

The key idea in Baba Is You is to manipulate the rules. The available text blocks are key, is, win, wall, door, stop, and others. The rule ""key is win"" is active. If I can change this rule, maybe I can make the key not be win, or make myself win. Alternatively, create a rule that lets me pass through walls.

Looking at the rule `baba` 1 left 2 down, `is` 2 down, `you` 1 right 2 down. So the rule ""baba is you"" is at that position. If I can move that rule, maybe I can change it. But can I move the text blocks? The rules say I can move objects or text that aren't stop. The wall is stop, but the rules themselves (text blocks) might not be stop unless they're part of a rule that makes them so. The current active rules don't make text blocks stop, except maybe the wall is stop. So perhaps I can move the text blocks.

The key is at 8 right 1 up. To get there, maybe I need to remove the wall blocking the path. The wall at 4 right 1 up is a physical wall. If I can change the rule that makes it a wall, maybe I can turn it into something else. The rule for wall is at 1 left 3 up: ""rule `wall` 1 step to the left and 3 step up"". So that text block says ""wall is stop"". If I can move that rule, I can change it. But how?

First, I need to reach the rule `wall` at 1 left 3 up. My current position is 1 left 2 down. Let's see the positions. The rule `wall` is 1 left and 3 up from where? The rule's position is relative. If I'm at 1 left 2 down, then moving up 3 steps would get me to the `wall` rule. But the path there has walls. From my position at 1 left 2 down, moving up would take me through walls at 4 right and 4 step up, etc. Wait, maybe the coordinates are relative? This is a bit confusing. Let me try to visualize the grid.

Assuming Baba's position is (0,0), then the rule `baba` is at (-1, -2). The rule `is` is at (0, -2), and `you` at (1, -2). The walls are at (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (4,0), (4,-1), and (4,-2). The key is at (8,1). The other rules are scattered: ""key is win"" at (7,4), ""is"" at (8,4), ""win"" at (9,4). The ""wall is stop"" rule is at (-1,3). So to get to the ""wall is stop"" rule at (-1,3), I need to move from (0,0) to (-1,3). But the path is blocked by walls at (4,y) for various y. Wait, maybe the grid is larger, and the walls are spread out. Alternatively, perhaps the coordinates are in steps relative to Baba's position.

This is getting complicated. Maybe a better approach is to see if I can create a new rule that allows me to pass through walls. For example, if I can make ""baba is stop"", then I would be stop, but that's bad. Alternatively, make ""wall is push"" or something. But how?

Alternatively, since key is win, maybe I don't need to reach the key physically. If I can change the rule to ""baba is win"", then just standing next to Baba (myself) would make me win. But how to do that. The current rules are ""baba is you"". If I can move that rule to ""baba is win"", that would work. The ""baba is you"" rule is at (-1,-2). The ""win"" rule is at (9,4). So to create ""baba is win"", I need to move the ""baba"" text block next to ""is"" and ""win"". The ""is"" is at (0,-2), and ""win"" is at (9,4). That seems far. Alternatively, use existing ""is"" blocks. There's an ""is"" at (8,4) as part of ""key is win"", and another ""is"" at (0,-2) as part of ""baba is you"".

So, if I can move the ""baba"" rule (at (-1,-2)) to be next to an ""is"" and a ""win"". For example, take the ""baba"" text block and move it to be adjacent to an ""is"" and a ""win"" text block. Let's see: the ""win"" is at (9,4), which is far away. Alternatively, use the ""is"" at (0,-2) and ""win"" somewhere else. But where is the ""win"" rule besides the one at (9,4)? There's also a ""rule `win`"" at (9,4), which is part of the ""key is win"" rule. Maybe if I can separate them.

Alternatively, the key is win, so if I can take the ""win"" property from the key and assign it to Baba. To do that, I need to create a rule ""baba is win"". To do that, I need the ""baba"" text block, an ""is"" text block, and the ""win"" text block all in adjacent cells.

The ""baba"" text block is at (-1,-2). The ""is"" text blocks are at (0,-2) and (8,4). The ""win"" text blocks are at (9,4) and perhaps others? Let's check the objects again. The active rules include ""key is win"", which is made up of ""key"" at (7,4), ""is"" at (8,4), ""win"" at (9,4). There's also a ""rule `win`"" at (9,4), which is part of that rule. So the ""win"" property is at (9,4).

So to create ""baba is win"", I need to move the ""baba"" block to be adjacent to an ""is"" and a ""win"". The closest ""is"" is at (0,-2), but that's part of the existing ""baba is you"" rule. If I can break that rule apart. For example, if I move the ""baba"" block away, then the ""baba is you"" rule is destroyed. Then I can create a new rule. But moving the ""baba"" block would require it to be moved to a new position next to ""is"" and ""win"".

Alternatively, use the ""is"" at (8,4) which is part of ""key is win"". If I can take the ""baba"" block and move it next to that ""is"" and the ""win"" at (9,4). The ""baba"" block is at (-1,-2). To get to (8,4), that's a long distance. Maybe there's a way to navigate around the walls.

But considering the walls at (4,y) for various y, moving right from Baba's position (assuming (0,0) is Baba) is blocked by walls starting at x=4. So moving right directly isn't possible. So perhaps I need to find a way to move around the walls. Wait, maybe the door at (7,2). The rule ""door"" is there. If door is passable unless there's a stop, but I don't know the rules for door. The active rules are key is win, wall is stop, baba is you. So door isn't defined, so it's probably passable. If I can reach the door, maybe I can go through it. But how to get there.

The door is at (7,2). From Baba's position (0,0), moving right 7 steps and up 2 would get there, but the path is blocked by walls at x=4. So that's not feasible. Alternatively, maybe there's a different path.

Wait, perhaps the key is at (8,1). To get there, I need to go right past x=4, but the walls are there. Unless I can change the wall rule. If I can turn off ""wall is stop"", then walls become passable. But how? The rule ""wall is stop"" is at (-1,3). To reach there, I need to move up 3 steps from Baba's position (0,0), but that's through walls. For example, moving up from (0,0) would take me to (0,1), but is there a wall there? Looking at the objects, there's a wall at (4,1), which is far to the right. So maybe the walls at x=4 are in a separate area. Baba is probably somewhere else.

This is getting too confusing without seeing the actual grid layout. Maybe I should focus on the available text blocks. The key is win, so if I can make Baba be Win, that's the goal. To do that, create ""baba is win"". The components are ""baba"" (at -1,-2), ""is"" (at 0,-2), and ""win"" (at 9,4). So I need to move the ""baba"" block next to an ""is"" and a ""win"". 

One approach: Move the ""is"" block from (0,-2) to be next to ""baba"" and ""win"". But ""is"" is part of the ""baba is you"" rule. If I move the ""is"" block, the rule breaks. Then I can create a new rule. Alternatively, use the ""is"" block at (8,4) which is part of ""key is win"". 

Alternatively, move the ""win"" block from (9,4) to be next to ""baba"" and ""is"". But ""win"" is part of the ""key is win"" rule. If I move ""win"", the rule breaks, so key is no longer win. But maybe that's acceptable if I can then create a new rule.

So the steps could be:

1. Break the ""key is win"" rule by moving one of its components. For example, move the ""win"" block away.

2. Create a new rule ""baba is win"" using the ""baba"", ""is"", and ""win"" blocks.

But to do that, I need to have all three blocks adjacent. Let's see:

- ""baba"" is at (-1,-2)

- ""is"" is at (0,-2) or (8,4)

- ""win"" is at (9,4)

So moving the ""baba"" block to (8,4) area, next to ""is"" at (8,4) and ""win"" at (9,4). That would require moving ""baba"" right 9 steps and up 6 steps, which seems impossible due to walls.

Alternatively, use the ""is"" at (0,-2). Move ""baba"" to (0,-2) and ""win"" to (1,-2). But where is the ""win"" block? The ""win"" block is at (9,4), which is far away. So this might not be feasible.

Another idea: Since the key is win, maybe I don't need to touch the key. If I can make Baba be Win by creating a rule ""baba is win"", then just standing somewhere would make me win. To do that, I need to assemble those three text blocks.

Assuming the text blocks are movable, I need to move the ""baba"" block to be next to an ""is"" and a ""win"". The closest ""win"" is at (9,4). The ""baba"" block is at (-1,-2). To get there, I need to move right 10 steps and up 6 steps, which is blocked by walls at x=4.

Wait, maybe there's a different way. The rule ""door"" is at (7,2). If I can make door be win, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, use the existing ""key is win"" rule. If I can move the ""key"" block to be next to ""baba"" and ""is"", making ""baba is key"", but that doesn't help since key is win.

Alternatively, delete the ""wall is stop"" rule. If walls are no longer stop, I can move through them. The ""wall is stop"" rule is at (-1,3). To reach there, I need to move from (0,0) to (-1,3). The path would be up 3 steps and left 1 step. But are there walls in the way? Looking at the objects, there's a wall at (4,4), (4,3), etc., which are far to the right. So maybe the path up and left is clear.

Assuming I can move left and up without hitting walls, I can reach the ""wall is stop"" rule. Once there, I can break it by moving one of its components. For example, move the ""wall"" block away, which would make the rule ""is stop"" remain, but wall would no longer be stop. Then walls become passable.

So the steps would be:

1. Move to the ""wall is stop"" rule at (-1,3).

2. Break the rule by moving the ""wall"" component away.

3. Now walls are not stop, so I can move through them to reach the key.

But how to get to (-1,3) from Baba's position (0,0). Moving left 1 and up 3. Let's see:

From (0,0):

- Move left 1 step to (-1,0).

- Move up 1 step to (-1,1).

- Move up another step to (-1,2).

- Move up one more step to (-1,3).

But are there any walls on this path? The objects listed are walls at (4,4), (4,3), etc., which are far to the right. So the path left and up should be clear. Assuming that, I can move left 1, up 3.

Once at (-1,3), the ""wall is stop"" rule is there. The components are ""wall"" at (-1,3), ""is"" at some position, and ""stop"" at (1,3). Wait, looking at the objects:

- rule `wall` 1 step to the left and 3 step up: So the ""wall"" text block is at (-1,3).

- rule `is` 3 step up: So ""is"" is at (0,3).

- rule `stop` 1 step to the right and 3 step up: ""stop"" is at (1,3).

So the ""wall is stop"" rule is composed of ""wall"" at (-1,3), ""is"" at (0,3), and ""stop"" at (1,3). To break this rule, I can move any of these components away.

For example, move the ""wall"" block from (-1,3) to a new position. Once moved, the ""wall is stop"" rule is destroyed, so walls are no longer stop.

So the action would be to take the ""wall"" text block (at (-1,3)) and move it somewhere else. Since I'm at (0,0), I need to navigate to (-1,3). Then, move the ""wall"" block.

But how to move the ""wall"" block. To move an object, you have to be adjacent to it and move in a direction that places it in an empty adjacent cell.

So first, move from (0,0) to (-1,3):

- Left once: (-1,0)

- Up three times: (-1,3)

Then, the ""wall"" block is at (-1,3). Now, move it. Possible directions: left, right, up, down.

If I move it left to (-2,3), that would break the ""wall is stop"" rule. Then walls are no longer stop, so I can walk through them.

Once that's done, I can go right past x=4 to reach the key at (8,1).

So the sequence of actions would be:

1. Move left to (-1,0).

2. Move up to (-1,1).

3. Move up to (-1,2).

4. Move up to (-1,3).

5. Move the ""wall"" block left to (-2,3).

Now, walls are not stop. Then, move right through the walls at x=4.

From (-1,3), move right to (0,3), (1,3), (2,3), ..., up to (8,3), then down to (8,1) where the key is.

But this requires a lot of steps, and the observation might not allow that many moves. However, the problem is to choose the next action, not the entire sequence.

Given that, the first necessary action is to move towards (-1,3) and then move the ""wall"" block.

But the immediate next action after the previous idle would be to start moving left.

Alternatively, if the agent is stuck because previous actions were idle, maybe the first move is to left.

So the chosen action would be to move left once.

Let's see what's going on here. The goal is to get to the key, which is currently the win condition because ""key is win"". But I need to figure out how to reach it without hitting any stop walls.

First, I need to move around the map. Let me look at the objects. The player is Baba, right? Because ""baba is you"". So the active rules are key is win, wall is stop, and baba is you. So touching a wall stops me. The key is 8 steps to the right and 1 step up from where I was before, but after moving left once, the positions have shifted. Now the key is at 9 steps to the right and 1 step up. Wait, in the current observation, the key is at 9 steps right and 1 step up. But the walls are all aligned at 5 steps right in various positions. Let me check the map again.

Looking at the current objects:

- Wall at 5 right, 4 up
- Rule `key` at 8 right, 4 up
- Rule `is` at 9 right, 4 up
- Rule `win` at 10 right, 4 up
- Rule `wall` at 3 up (but where's the position here? Maybe it's relative? Not sure)
- Other walls and rules are at 3 step up, 1 right and 3 step up, etc.

The key is directly to the right and one step up from where I am now. But there's a wall at 5 right, 1 step up. Wait, no, the wall at 5 right, 1 step up is present. So if I try to go up from my current position (which after moving left once, my position must have shifted), but wait, the exact position of the player isn't given here. Hmm, maybe I need to infer based on the rules and objects.

Wait, in the previous steps, when I moved left, the rules and objects moved accordingly. So the entire map shifts when I move. For example, when I moved left once, the key moved to 8 right and 4 up, then after another left, it's at 9 right and 4 up. So each left move shifts all objects to the right by one step? Because when I moved left, the key's position changed from 7 right to 8 right, then to 9 right. So maybe moving left shifts the map to the right, making objects appear closer.

So my current position is such that moving left again would shift the map right, but I need to navigate to the key. Let's think: the key is currently at 9 right and 1 up. But there's a wall at 5 right, 1 up. Wait, but the player's position isn't specified. Maybe I'm at 5 right, 4 up? Because the walls are at 4 right and 4 up initially, but after moving left, perhaps my position is now at 5 right, 4 up. Let me try to visualize.

Original positions after moving left once:

The key was at 8 right, 4 up. Then moving left again, perhaps the key moves to 9 right, 4 up. So the player must be at 8 right, 4 up before moving left again. Wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe another approach: the game's movement shifts the player and the map. So when I move left, the entire map shifts right, making objects appear to the left. Therefore, moving left would allow me to reach objects that were previously out of reach.

The key is the win condition, but it's behind a wall. However, the wall is defined as stop, so touching it would end the game. But ""key is win"" means if I reach the key, I win. So I need to find a way to get past the wall. But how?

Looking at the rules, perhaps I can change the rules to make the wall not stop. For example, if I can make ""wall is not stop"" or something else. To do that, I need to move the ""stop"" rule away from the wall's definition. The current rules are:

- key is win
- wall is stop
- baba is you

There's also a rule `wall` at 3 step up, which is probably ""wall is ..."", but the exact property isn't clear. Wait, in the objects list, there's a rule `wall` at 3 step up. That must mean it's part of a rule like ""X is wall"". But since the active rules only show ""key is win"", ""wall is stop"", and ""baba is you"", maybe the other rules are non-active or not parsed correctly.

Alternatively, the rule `wall` at 3 step up might be part of a rule like ""door is wall"" or something else. But the active rules don't mention that. So perhaps those are inactive because the necessary text blocks to form the rules are separate.

To manipulate the rules, I need to move text blocks. For example, if there's a ""stop"" rule attached to wall, I can move the ""stop"" text block to a different subject. But the ""wall is stop"" rule is active, so to change that, I need to move either ""wall"" or ""stop"" away.

Looking at the objects, there's a rule `stop` at 1 step right and 3 step up. So if I can move that rule away from the ""wall is stop"" rule, then the wall might no longer be stop. But how? To do that, I need to push the ""stop"" rule block so that it's no longer connected to the ""wall is"" rule.

Wait, the ""wall is stop"" rule is formed by the text blocks ""wall"", ""is"", and ""stop"" being adjacent. So if I can move the ""stop"" block away from the ""wall is"" sequence, the rule ""wall is stop"" would be broken. Similarly, I can create a new rule by combining other text blocks.

In the current observation, after moving left twice, the rule `stop` is at 2 steps right and 3 step up. The ""wall is"" rule is at rule `wall` at 3 step up and rule `is` at 1 step right and 3 step up. So the ""wall is"" part is rule `wall` at 3 up and rule `is` at 1 right and 3 up. Then the ""stop"" rule is at 2 right and 3 up. So the three blocks are adjacent: wall - is - stop, forming ""wall is stop"". To break this, I need to separate them.

If I can move the ""stop"" rule block further away, then the ""wall is stop"" rule is no longer active. Then, walls wouldn't be stop, and I could push through them. Alternatively, I could create a new rule where ""baba is stop"", but that would make me stop, which is bad. Alternatively, make ""key is you"", so I can move the key and pick it up.

But let's focus on breaking the ""wall is stop"" rule first. To do that, I need to move the ""stop"" rule block away from the ""wall is"" sequence. The ""stop"" is currently at 2 right and 3 up. The ""is"" is at 1 right and 3 up, and ""wall"" is at 3 up (but the position is a bit unclear). Wait, the rule `wall` is at 3 step up, but the exact horizontal position isn't specified. Maybe it's aligned with the other rules. This is getting a bit confusing without a visual map.

Alternatively, perhaps moving the ""stop"" rule down or in another direction would separate it from the ""wall is"" rule. If I can push the ""stop"" block to a different location, the rule breaks. Then walls wouldn't be stop, and I could move through them to reach the key.

Looking at the objects, after moving left, the key is at 9 right, 1 up. There's a wall at 5 right, 1 up. So the path to the key is blocked by that wall. If I could make the wall not stop, I could walk through it. Alternatively, create a rule that allows me to move over it.

Another approach: since the key is win, maybe I can pick up the key by making myself a key. For example, if I can create the rule ""baba is key"", then since I'm Baba, I would become the key, and since key is win, touching it would make me win. But to do that, I need to move the text blocks ""baba"", ""is"", and ""key"" together.

In the current objects, there's a rule `baba` at 2 steps down, rule `is` at 1 right and 2 steps down, and rule `you` at 2 right and 2 steps down. So ""baba is you"" is active. If I can move the ""key"" text block near them, I could create ""baba is key"", making me the key, thus winning.

The key is currently at 9 right, 1 up. To reach it, I might need to navigate around the walls. But with walls being stop, that's tricky. Alternatively, move the ""stop"" rule away first.

So the plan could be:

1. Move to the position of the ""stop"" rule (2 right, 3 up) and push it away from the ""wall is"" rule.
2. Break the ""wall is stop"" rule, making walls passable.
3. Navigate to the key, which is now behind a non-stop wall, and touch it to win.

Alternatively:

1. Gather the ""baba"", ""is"", and ""key"" text blocks to create ""baba is key"", making myself the key and winning upon touching it.

But how to execute this?

Let's look at the current positions of the text blocks:

- rule `key` is at 8 right, 4 up (from previous observation). Wait, in the latest observation after moving left twice, the rule `key` is at 8 steps right and 4 up. The ""is"" is at 9 right, 4 up, and ""win"" at 10 right, 4 up. So the ""key is win"" rule is formed by those three blocks.

The ""wall is stop"" rule is formed by the rule `wall` at 3 up, rule `is` at 1 right and 3 up, and rule `stop` at 2 right and 3 up.

The ""baba is you"" rule is at rule `baba` at 2 steps down, rule `is` at 1 right and 2 steps down, and rule `you` at 2 right and 2 steps down.

So to create a new rule like ""baba is key"", I need to move the ""key"" block (currently at 8 right, 4 up) near the ""baba is"" sequence.

But first, I need to navigate to that area. However, moving there might involve stepping on walls. Alternatively, maybe I can push the ""stop"" rule away first.

Let me try to outline possible steps:

Step 1: Move to the position of the ""stop"" rule (2 right, 3 up) and push it down or left to separate it from the ""wall is"" rule.

But how to get there? The player's position isn't explicitly stated, but assuming that after moving left twice, the player is now at a position where moving right towards the text blocks is possible.

Alternatively, maybe the player is at the position of the ""baba"" rule, which is 1 left and 2 steps down from the wall at 4 right, 4 up. This is getting too vague without a map.

Alternatively, think in terms of directions. The key is to the right and one up from the current player position. But there's a wall blocking the path. To get past the wall, either make the wall not stop or make myself able to pass through stops.

Another idea: if I can make ""wall is push"", then I can push walls out of the way. But to do that, I need to create the rule ""wall is push"". The text blocks for ""push"" aren't present, though. The available rules are key, is, win, wall, stop, door, baba, you.

Wait, there's a rule `door` at 7 right, 2 up. Maybe I can create a rule like ""door is push"", but that's not directly helpful.

Alternatively, use the existing rules. If I can make ""stop is nothing"", but there's no ""nothing"" text block.

Back to the original idea: break ""wall is stop"" by moving the ""stop"" block away. The ""stop"" is at 2 right, 3 up. If I can move it to the left or right, separating it from the ""wall is"" sequence.

To move the ""stop"" block, I need to be adjacent to it and move in a direction that pushes it. Since the player is Baba, and ""baba is you"", I can move objects that are not stop. The ""stop"" rule itself is a text block, but is it considered stop? The rule ""wall is stop"" makes walls stop, but text blocks might have their own properties. Wait, the rules define properties of objects. Text blocks are objects themselves, but their properties are determined by the rules. For example, the text block ""stop"" has no inherent property unless it's part of a rule.

So maybe I can move the ""stop"" text block because it's not defined as stop. Wait, the rule ""wall is stop"" makes walls stop, but the ""stop"" text block itself isn't a wall, so it might be movable. Let me check the tips: ""You can only move objects or text that are not defined as 'STOP' or similar immovable properties.""

So, if an object is defined as stop (like walls), you can't move them. But text blocks are objects, and unless a text block is defined as stop, you can move them. The ""stop"" text block is part of the rule ""wall is stop"", but the text block itself isn't a wall, so it might be movable.

Therefore, I can move the ""stop"" text block to break the ""wall is stop"" rule. To do that, I need to navigate to the ""stop"" block at 2 right, 3 up and push it in a direction that separates it from the ""wall is"" rule.

Assuming the player is near that area, moving right or left would push the ""stop"" block. If I move right from the ""stop"" block's position, it would go to 3 right, 3 up, breaking the adjacency with ""is"" at 1 right, 3 up. Wait, the ""is"" is at 1 right, 3 up, and ""wall"" is probably at 0 right, 3 up (assuming the ""wall"" rule is to the left of ""is""). So the sequence is wall - is - stop. If I move the ""stop"" block to the right, it becomes wall - is - (empty), breaking the rule.

So the action would be to move right while being adjacent to the ""stop"" block. But how do I get to the ""stop"" block's position?

Assuming the player is at 1 right, 3 up (where the ""is"" rule is), then moving right would take them to 2 right, 3 up, which is where the ""stop"" block is. Then pushing it right to 3 right, 3 up would break the rule.

But the player's current position isn't explicitly given. This is challenging without knowing where exactly the player is located. However, in the previous steps, after moving left twice, the key's position shifted right each time, suggesting that the player is moving left, causing the map to shift right. So the player's position is likely at the leftmost part of the map, and moving right would bring them towards the center.

Alternatively, perhaps the player is at the position of the ""baba"" rule, which is 1 left and 2 steps down from the wall at 4 right, 4 up. After moving left twice, the player's position would have shifted right by two steps, but this is getting too vague.

Another approach: since the key is win, and it's currently at 9 right, 1 up, perhaps the fastest way is to move right towards it. But the path is blocked by a wall at 5 right, 1 up. If I can make that wall not stop, I can move through it.

To break the ""wall is stop"" rule, I need to move the ""stop"" block away. The ""stop"" block is at 2 right, 3 up. If I can get to that position and push it, say, down to 2 right, 4 up, that would separate it from the ""wall is"" rule.

Assuming the player is near the ""stop"" block, moving down from there would push it to 2 right, 4 up, breaking the rule. Then walls are no longer stop, and I can move through them.

So the steps would be:

1. Move to the position of the ""stop"" block (2 right, 3 up).
2. Push it down to 2 right, 4 up.
3. Now, walls are not stop, so move right through the wall blocking the key's path.
4. Reach the key and win.

But how to navigate there? The player's position isn't clear, but after moving left twice, the key is now further right. Perhaps the player is at 5 right, 4 up (original wall position shifted left twice). To get to the ""stop"" block at 2 right, 3 up, the player needs to move left and down.

Alternatively, maybe the player is at 5 right, 4 up, and needs to move down to 5 right, 3 up (there's a wall there), then left to 4 right, 3 up, but that's a wall as well. Hmm.

This is quite complicated without a visual map. Perhaps the best immediate action is to try to break the ""wall is stop"" rule by moving the ""stop"" block. The action would involve moving right towards the ""stop"" block and pushing it.

Assuming the player is adjacent to the ""stop"" block, the action would be to move right or down to push it. If the ""stop"" block is at 2 right, 3 up, and the player is at 1 right, 3 up (next to it), then moving right would push the ""stop"" block to 3 right, 3 up, breaking the rule.

Therefore, the chosen action is to move right.

Let's see. In Baba Is You, I need to figure out the rules and manipulate them to reach the win condition. The active rules right now are key is win, wall is stop, and baba is you. So, normally, I'm Baba because ""baba is you,"" which means I can move around. The win condition is the key, so normally I need to get to the key. But wait, the key is labeled as win, so maybe touching it would make me win. But there are walls around some areas that are stop, meaning I can't pass through them.

Looking at the objects on the map, the key is at 8 steps right and 1 step up. There's a wall at 4 steps right and 1 step up, so I need to get past that. But how? The walls are stop, so I can't move through them unless I change their property. The rules mention ""rule wall 1 step to the left and 3 step up"" and ""rule stop 1 step to the right and 3 step up."" Maybe I can move those rule text blocks to change the walls' properties.

Wait, in the current observation, the key is win, and the walls are stop. The Baba is you, so I can move. The problem is the path to the key is blocked by walls. The key is at 8 right, 1 up. Let me check the map layout. There's a wall at 4 right, 1 up, then the key is 4 steps further right. But between me (assuming I'm Baba's position) and the key, there might be walls. Wait, the initial position of Baba isn't specified here. The active rules have ""rule baba 1 step to the left and 2 steps down"" — so Baba's position is at 1 left and 2 down from where that rule is placed. But the exact coordinates might be tricky. Let's assume my position is near the bottom part where the rules are placed.

If I need to get to the key at 8 right, 1 up, I have to navigate through the walls. The walls are at 4 right and 1 up, 4 right and 2 up, etc. Maybe I can move some rules to make the walls not stop. For example, if I can change ""wall is stop"" to something else, like ""wall is push"" or remove the ""stop"" rule, then I could move past them. But to do that, I need to move the text blocks that create those rules.

Looking at the rules: ""rule `wall` 1 step to the left and 3 step up"" and ""rule `stop` 1 step to the right and 3 step up."" These are probably the ""wall is stop"" rule. If I can move the ""stop"" rule text block away, then the wall's property would change. But wait, can I move those rules? The rules say that only non-stop objects can be moved. Since ""wall is stop,"" any wall has the stop property, including the text blocks. But the text blocks themselves are objects. Wait, the text blocks like ""rule `wall`"" are separate objects. So if a text block isn't part of a stop rule, maybe it can be moved. Let me check: the active rules include ""wall is stop,"" so any object that is a wall (including text blocks labeled as wall?) would be stop. Wait, no. The rules define properties. ""Wall is stop"" means that any object labeled as wall has the stop property. So the text blocks that say ""wall"" are objects, and if they are labeled as wall, then they are stop. But I can move text blocks if they are not stop. However, since ""wall is stop,"" any wall text block (like the rule `wall` at 1 left 3 up) is a stop, so I can't move it. That complicates things.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule that makes Baba able to move through walls. For example, if I can change ""wall is stop"" to ""wall is you"" or something, but that would require moving the existing ""wall is stop"" rule's components. Let's see. The existing ""wall is stop"" is made of three text blocks: rule `wall`, rule `is`, rule `stop`. If I can move those, I can break the rule. But since ""wall is stop"" makes the wall objects stop, including those text blocks, I can't move them. Hmm.

Wait, but maybe the text blocks that make up the rule are not considered part of the wall's property. For example, the rule ""wall is stop"" is composed of three separate text blocks: ""wall"", ""is"", ""stop"" placed next to each other. So if I can move the ""stop"" text block away, the rule ""wall is stop"" would be broken. But the problem is that the ""stop"" text block is part of that rule and is located at 1 step right and 3 step up. Since the rule ""wall is stop"" exists, any object called stop is stop, including that text block. So I can't move it. That's a problem.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule that overrides the existing one. For example, if I make ""baba is not stop"" or ""baba can move through stop."" But how? The current rules don't allow that. Let me think. The active rules are key is win, wall is stop, and baba is you. So I'm Baba, can move, but walls block me. To get past the walls, I need to either remove the ""wall is stop"" rule or change my properties.

Another approach: the key is win, so touching it makes me win. But the key is behind walls. Maybe I can push the walls if they are pushable. But since they are stop, I can't push them. Unless I can change their property to push. But how?

Wait, maybe there's a door at 7 right, 2 up. The rule for door is there. Not sure how that helps. The ball is at 5 right, 3 up. Maybe not relevant.

Wait, the rule `baba` is at 1 left and 2 steps down. So if I can move that rule's components (baba, is, you) to create a new rule, like ""baba is win"" or ""baba is key,"" maybe that would help. Let me check the position of the rule `baba`, `is`, and `you`. The rule `baba` is 1 left and 2 down. The `is` is at 2 steps down, and `you` is 1 right and 2 down. So placing them together would make ""baba is you,"" which is already the case. If I can rearrange them to make ""baba is win,"" that would make me win. But how do I get there?

My current position isn't specified, but let's assume I'm near the bottom where the baba rule is. To create ""baba is win,"" I need to move the `win` text block (which is at 9 right, 4 up) and bring it next to the `baba` and `is` text blocks. But moving the `win` text block would require it to not be stop. The `win` is part of the ""key is win"" rule, but since key is win, does that affect the win text block? Not sure. The `win` text block itself is an object, and if it's not defined as stop, I can move it. Let's check the active rules: wall is stop, but nothing says win is stop. So the `win` text block is movable. If I can move it to the `baba` and `is` rule components, then I can create ""baba is win,"" making me win.

But how to reach the `win` text block at 9 right, 4 up. There are walls to the right. The path from my current position (assuming near the bottom) to 9 right, 4 up is blocked by walls. For example, at 4 right, 4 up there's a wall. Then rule `key`, `is`, `win` are further right. So maybe I need to move through those areas. But those areas are to the right of the walls. Wait, maybe there's a way around. Let's visualize the map.

Looking at the objects:

- Wall at 4 right, 4 up.
- Then rule `key` at 7 right, 4 up.
- rule `is` at 8 right, 4 up.
- rule `win` at 9 right, 4 up.

So from 4 right,4 up (the wall), moving right would take me to 5 right,4 up, which is probably open. But there's a wall at 4 right,3 up, 4 right,2 up, etc. Maybe I can go around the walls by moving up or down. But the key is at 8 right,1 up. Wait, the key's position is 8 right,1 up. The wall at 4 right,1 up is blocking the path. So maybe I need to go around the wall. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps I can move the ""wall is stop"" rule by moving its components. The ""wall is stop"" rule is composed of rule `wall` at 1 left 3 up, rule `is` at 3 up, and rule `stop` at 1 right 3 up. If I can move the `stop` text block away, then the rule ""wall is stop"" would be broken, making walls no longer stop. But since the `stop` text block is part of that rule and walls are stop, moving it would require that it's not stop. But since it's part of the stop rule, it's stop, so I can't move it. Trapped.

Hmm. Another Idea: The key is win, so if I can get the key and touch it, I win. But the key is behind a wall. Maybe I can push the wall if it's pushable. But walls are stop, so I can't. Unless I can change the wall's property to push. But how?

Wait, there's a rule `door` at 7 right,2 up. Not sure. Maybe if I can create a rule that door is you, then I can go through the door. But that's a long shot.

Alternatively, maybe I can make myself a door. If I create ""baba is door,"" then since door might not be stop, I could pass through walls. But how to create that rule. The `door` text block is at 7 right,2 up. So I need to get there and arrange the rule components.

But moving to 7 right,2 up is possible? Let's see. My current position isn't clear, but assuming I'm near the bottom where the baba rule is. To get to 7 right,2 up, I need to move right and up, but there are walls in the way. For example, at 4 right,4 up is a wall. Then from there, moving right to 5 right,4 up (if that's open). Then down to 5 right,3 up, which is a wall. Then right to 6 right,3 up, which is a ball. Then right to 7 right,3 up, which is a wall. Then up to 7 right,2 up (the door rule). But there's a wall at 4 right,2 up. So maybe this path is blocked.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to go around the walls by moving up from the bottom. For example, starting from where I am (near the baba rule at 1 left 2 down), moving right to 0 right,2 down, then up to 0 right,1 down, etc. But this is getting complicated without knowing the exact map layout.

Another approach: Since the key is win, maybe I don't need to move past the walls but instead change the rules so that the walls aren't stop. For example, if I can change ""wall is stop"" to ""wall is push"" or remove the stop property. But as before, the stop text block is part of that rule and is stop, so I can't move it.

Wait, what if I can create a new rule that says ""stop is nothing""? That would remove the stop property. But to do that, I'd need to have the text blocks for ""stop is nothing"" somewhere. But I don't see any such text blocks on the map. The existing rules are key is win, wall is stop, and baba is you. The other text blocks are part of these rules.

Alternatively, maybe I can break the ""wall is stop"" rule by moving its parts. The rule is made of three text blocks: rule `wall`, rule `is`, rule `stop`. If I can move any of these, the rule breaks. But since the rule enforces that walls are stop, and those text blocks are part of the wall, they are stop, making them immovable. So I can't move them.

This seems like a dead end. Maybe the solution is to create a new rule that makes Baba able to move through walls. For example, ""baba is not stop"". To do that, I need to have the text blocks ""baba"", ""is"", ""not"", ""stop"" arranged correctly. But I don't see a ""not"" text block on the map. The available text blocks are key, is, win, wall, stop, door, you.

Wait, there's a rule `door` at 7 right,2 up. But no ""not"" rule. Without a ""not"" text block, I can't create negation. So that's not possible.

Another idea: The key is currently win, but maybe if I can make the key not win, then the original win condition (which might be elsewhere) could be changed. But there's no indication of another win object. The active rules only say key is win.

Alternatively, maybe I can make myself win by creating ""baba is win"". To do that, I need to move the `win` text block next to `baba` and `is`. The `win` is at 9 right,4 up. The `baba` rule is at 1 left,2 down. That's quite far. How to get there?

Assuming I can move right and up, but there are walls blocking the path. For example, from the bottom (near baba's rule), moving right to 0,2 down, then up to 0,1 down, etc., but the walls at 4 right in various up positions might block the way. It's possible that the path is blocked, making it impossible to reach the `win` text block.

Wait, maybe there's a way to use the door. If I can make the door a win, but I don't see how. The door's rule is at 7 right,2 up. To make door win, I'd need to create ""door is win"", but I don't have the `win` text block nearby.

Alternatively, maybe the solution is to move the key to where I am, but since the key is win, and I need to touch it, but I can't move it through walls either.

This is tricky. Let me recap:

- I'm Baba, can move.
- Walls are stop, blocking my path.
- Key is win, but behind walls.
- Need to either remove wall's stop property, move past walls by changing my properties, or rearrange rules to make myself win.

Another approach: Use the ball. The ball is at 5 right,3 up. Maybe I can push it, but since walls are stop, and the ball's property isn't specified, maybe it's pushable. But how does that help? Unless pushing the ball allows me to reach a different part of the map.

Alternatively, the door at 7 right,2 up. If I can make the door passable, maybe by changing its property. But I don't have the text blocks for that.

Wait, the rule `door` is a separate object. The rule `door` is at 7 right,2 up. Maybe I can create a rule like ""door is you"", making me able to go through the door. But to do that, I need to arrange the `door`, `is`, `you` text blocks. The `you` is already part of the baba rule at 1 right,2 down. So if I can move the `you` text block next to `door` and `is`, that would create ""door is you"". Then, if I become door (by ""baba is door""), I could go through walls. But let's see:

Steps:

1. Move the `you` text block from 1 right,2 down to near the `door` rule at 7 right,2 up.
2. Arrange `door`, `is`, `you` to make ""door is you"".
3. Then create ""baba is door"" by moving `baba`, `is`, `door` together.

This might work. Let's check if the `you` text block is movable. Since ""wall is stop"" and ""baba is you"", but the `you` text block itself is part of the ""baba is you"" rule. The `you` text block's property: since ""you"" isn't defined as stop, it should be movable. So yes, I can move the `you` block.

So the plan is:

- Move right to reach the area near the door rule (7 right,2 up).
- Take the `you` block from 1 right,2 down and place it next to `door` and `is` to make ""door is you"".
- Then, move the `baba`, `is`, `door` blocks to create ""baba is door"".
- Now, since door might not be stop, I can walk through walls.

Once I'm a door, I can move past the walls and reach the key. Then, since the key is win, touching it would make me win.

But how to execute this step by step?

First, I need to navigate to the door's position (7 right,2 up). Let's see the path:

Starting from the baba rule area (1 left,2 down), which is likely at position (0,0) if we consider that. Moving right to 0 right,2 down, then up to 0 right,1 down, etc. But there are walls at 4 right in various positions. Maybe there's a way around.

Alternatively, moving up from the baba rule area. The rule `baba` is at 1 left,2 down. So moving left from there would be towards negative steps, which might not be possible. Maybe the map is laid out with Baba starting at a certain point.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is at 8 right,1 up, and the door is at 7 right,2 up. So if I can move up from the key's position, but it's blocked by walls.

This is getting too vague without the exact map layout. But based on the objects listed, the key is at 8 right,1 up, surrounded by walls.","

Let's try to figure out how to solve this Baba Is You level. The active rules are ""key is win,"" ""wall is stop,"" and ""baba is you."" The goal is usually to reach the win object, which in this case is the key. But since the key is labeled as win, maybe touching it will make me win.

Looking at the objects on the map: there's a key to the right and down from where I assume Baba is. There are walls everywhere, some marked as stop. The rules are also scattered around. The ball is there, but I don't know if that's relevant yet. The door is near some rules, but I can't open it unless maybe I change a rule.

First, I need to move. Since Baba is you, I can move around unless there's a stop. The walls are stop, so I can't move into them. Let me check the positions. The key is at 8 steps right, 1 step up. The rule blocks for key, is, and win are all to the right and up. To get to the key, I need to move right and down, but there are walls blocking the way. 

Wait, there's a rule saying ""key is win,"" so if I can move that rule, maybe I can change something else. For example, if I can make ""baba is win"" instead, then touching Baba would make me win. But how to do that? The rule blocks for ""baba"", ""is"", and ""you"" are at 1 step left and 2 steps down. Maybe I can move those rules.

But to move any rule or object, they can't be stopped. The wall is stop, so if I'm next to a rule or object that's not stop, I can move it. Let me see. The ""key is win"" rules are all to the right and up. The ball is at 5 right, 3 up, which is next to a wall and a stop rule. The ""door"" rule is at 7 right, 2 up, near another wall.

Looking at the bottom part, there's a rule ""baba"" at 1 left, 2 down; ""is"" at 2 down; and ""you"" at 1 right, 2 down. If I can move these, I can create a new rule like ""baba is win"" or ""baba is you"" (which is already there). Wait, ""baba is you"" is already an active rule. So maybe combining ""baba"" with ""win"" using the ""is"" rule.

So the plan is: move the ""baba"" rule to the left, the ""is"" rule down, and the ""win"" rule to where they can form ""baba is win."" Then, touching Baba would make me win. Alternatively, move the existing ""key is win"" rule to make ""baba is win.""

But how to move the rules? Let's see their positions. The ""baba"" rule is 1 step left and 2 steps down from the current position. If I move left twice, then down once, I can get to the ""baba"" rule. But I need to make sure I can move through the path without hitting walls.

Wait, the walls are at 4 steps right in various positions. Let me visualize the grid. Suppose I'm at position (0,0). The wall at 4 right, 4 up would be at (4,4). The ""key"" is at (8,1). The ""baba"" rule is at (-1, -2). The ""is"" rule is at (0, -2). The ""you"" rule is at (1, -2).

To move left to get to ""baba"" rule: from (0,0) move left once to (-1,0), but there's a wall at 4 right and 4 up, which is not in the way here. Wait, the walls are at fixed positions. The walls are at 4 steps right and 4 up, 3 up, 2 up, 1 up, same level, 1 down, etc. So the path to the ""baba"" rule at (-1, -2) would require moving left and down, but need to check if there are any walls blocking.

From the initial position, moving left once to (-1,0) is possible if there's no wall there. Then down to (-1,-1), then down to (-1,-2) where the ""baba"" rule is. Then pick up the ""baba"" rule and move it somewhere. Similarly, the ""is"" rule is at (0, -2), so maybe moving right to (1,-2) to get to ""you"" rule. But I need to collect ""baba"", ""is"", and ""win"" to create a new rule.

Alternatively, maybe create ""baba is win"" by moving the existing ""win"" rule (at 9 right,4 up) down and left to where the ""baba"" and ""is"" rules are. But that seems complicated.

Another approach: since the key is win, moving to the key and taking it would make me win. But the key is at (8,1), and the path is blocked by walls. The walls at 4 steps right in various positions. Maybe there's a way to redirect the path by moving rules to make walls non-stop.

For example, if I can change ""wall is stop"" to something else, like ""wall is push"" or remove the ""stop"" property. But how? The ""wall is stop"" rule is at 1 left,3 up and another at 1 right,3 up. To move those, I need to get to their positions.

Let me think step by step. Current active rules: key is win, wall is stop, baba is you. So I am Baba, can move, but walls stop me. The key is the win object. So touching the key should make me win, but it's behind walls. So I need to move the walls or make them passable.

If I can change ""wall is stop"" to ""wall is"", then walls wouldn't stop me. To do that, I need to move the ""stop"" rule. The ""stop"" rule is at 1 right,3 up. If I can move that rule away, then the ""wall is"" rule remains, making walls non-stop. Then I can walk through walls.

So the steps would be: move to the ""stop"" rule's position, pick it up, and move it somewhere else. But how to get there.

The ""stop"" rule is at 1 step right and 3 step up from the current position. So from where I am (assuming starting position is at 0,0), moving right once to (1,0), then up three times to (1,3). But along the way, are there walls?

Looking at the objects: wall at 4 right,4 up; 4 right,3 up; etc. The path to (1,3) would be clear if there are no walls in between. Let's check. At (1,3), is there a wall? The wall at 1 right,3 up is the ""stop"" rule's position. Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at 1 right,3 up, which is the same as the wall's position? Or is the wall a separate object?

The objects listed include ""wall 4 steps to the right and 3 step up"" and ""rule `stop` 1 step to the right and 3 step up"". So they are separate objects: a wall at (4,3) and a rule at (1,3). So moving right to (1,0), then up to (1,3) would reach the ""stop"" rule. Once there, I can pick it up and move it, say, down to (1,2), which is a free space. Then the ""wall is stop"" rule would be broken into ""wall is"" (since ""stop"" is removed), making walls passable.

Once walls are not stop, I can walk through them and reach the key. But I need to test this.

Alternatively, if I can make ""key is you"", then the key would be controllable, but the active rule is ""key is win"", so that's not directly helpful.

Another idea: since the key is win, if I can move the ""key is win"" rule to make ""baba is win"", then touching Baba would make me win. To do that, I need to collect ""baba"", ""is"", and ""win"" rules and rearrange them.

The ""baba"" rule is at (-1,-2), ""is"" at (0,-2), and ""win"" at (9,4). So moving ""baba"" to (0,-2), then ""is"" next to it, then ""win"". But that requires moving those rules across the map, which might be tricky due to walls.

Alternatively, move the ""win"" rule down and left to combine with ""baba"" and ""is"". The ""win"" rule is at (9,4). Moving it down four steps would get it to (9,0), but there are walls at 4 right in various positions. It might be possible to move it step by step, avoiding walls.

This seems complicated. Maybe the quickest way is to remove the ""stop"" property from walls. Let's try that.

First, move to the ""stop"" rule at (1,3). From the starting position (0,0), move right once (to (1,0)), then up three times (to (1,3)). But need to check if the path is clear. Between (0,0) and (1,0), is there a wall? Looking at the objects, the walls are at 4 steps right in various positions, so (1,0) is clear. Then moving up from (1,0) to (1,1), (1,2), (1,3). At each step, check if there's a wall. The wall at 4 right,1 up is at (4,1), which is not in the way. So the path should be clear.

Once at (1,3), the ""stop"" rule is there. Pick it up (by moving onto it?) and then move it to a different position. For example, move left to (0,3), then down to (0,2), etc. But need to find a spot where placing the ""stop"" rule doesn't interfere with other rules.

After moving the ""stop"" rule away, the ""wall is stop"" rule becomes ""wall is"", so walls are no longer stop. Then I can walk through walls and reach the key.

So the actions would be: right, up, up, up (to reach (1,3)), take the ""stop"" rule, move it left and down, then go through walls to the key.

But the problem is that each action must be a single step. So the first action after failing previous ones might be to move right to get closer to the ""stop"" rule.

Wait, the previous actions were left, right, left, etc., but failed. Maybe the assistant needs to figure out the correct path.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial position is different. Maybe the assistant needs to determine where Baba is located based on the objects. Looking at the objects, there's a rule ""baba"" at 1 left and 2 down, which is probably the position of the Baba object. So Baba is at (-1, -2). The player needs to move to that position first to activate the ""baba is you"" rule.

Wait, no. In Baba Is You, the player controls the object that is defined as ""you"". The active rule ""baba is you"" means that the Baba object is the player. So the player's position is where the Baba object is. Looking at the objects, there's a rule ""baba"" at 1 left and 2 down, but where is the actual Baba object? Maybe the Baba object is at the position of the ""baba"" rule? Or is it a separate object?

This is a bit confusing. In Baba Is You, the text blocks define the rules, and the objects (like Baba, Wall, Key) are on the map. The player controls the object that is ""you"". So if ""baba is you"", then the Baba object is the player. So the player's position is where the Baba object is located. But in the given observation, the Baba object isn't listed separately; instead, there's a rule ""baba"" at 1 left and 2 steps down. Maybe the Baba object is at that rule's position? Or is the rule a separate entity?

This is a bit unclear. Assuming that the ""baba"" rule is a text block that can be moved, and the actual Baba object is elsewhere. But typically, in Baba Is You, the player is the Baba icon, which is a separate object. However, in the observation provided, the objects listed include walls, key, ball, door, and rules. The ""baba"" rule is a text block, not the Baba object. So perhaps the Baba object is implied to be where the ""baba is you"" rule applies, or at a default position.

This might be a misunderstanding. Let's assume that the player is at the position of the ""baba"" rule, which is 1 step left and 2 steps down from some origin. Alternatively, the player's starting position is unknown, but needs to move to the Baba object to control it.

Given the confusion, perhaps the best approach is to focus on moving the ""stop"" rule to make walls passable, then navigate to the key.

So, step-by-step:

1. Move to the ""stop"" rule at (1,3) by moving right, up, up, up.
2. Pick up the ""stop"" rule and move it to a different location, say left to (0,3), then down to (0,2).
3. Now, walls are no longer stop, so can walk through them.
4. Move right through the walls to reach the key at (8,1).

But each action must be a single step. The previous attempts were ""left"" and ""right"", which might not be towards the goal. The correct action now should be to move right to start moving towards the ""stop"" rule.

So the first valid action would be ""right"" to move towards the ""stop"" rule.

6,Failed to obtain a valid action from the reasoning.,"<reasoning>
Let's see. The current goal is to figure out the correct action to take in this Baba Is You level. The active rules are key is win, wall is stop, and baba is you. So, normally, the player is Baba, and the win condition is grabbing the key. But since ""key is win,"" that means if I get the key, I win. However, walls are stop, so I can't move through them.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key located 8 steps to the right and 4 steps up from the current position. But right now, the path to the key might be blocked by walls. The wall is 3 steps to the right and 4 steps up, so maybe the key is behind that wall? Wait, no—the key is 6 steps to the right and 4 steps up from where? The exact positions might be a bit confusing. Let me parse the object positions again.

Wait, the observation shows the key at 6 steps to the right and 4 steps up. The current player position isn't explicitly stated, but assuming the player is at the starting point, which might be where the ""baba"" rule is located. The ""rule `baba`"" is at 2 steps left and 2 steps down from the current observation's position. So maybe the player is positioned somewhere relative to those rules.

But perhaps the main issue is that the path to the key is blocked by walls. Let's check the walls. There's a wall 3 steps to the right and 4 steps up, then another wall 3 steps right and 3 steps up, and so on. The key is 6 steps right and 4 steps up. Wait, that might mean the key is two steps further to the right than the wall at 3 steps right. So maybe the key is in a separate area. But how do I get there?

Alternatively, maybe the walls are arranged in such a way that I need to move around them. But since walls are stop, I can't push them unless they're not defined as stop. Wait, the rules say ""wall is stop,"" so any object labeled as wall can't be moved. So I can't push walls; I have to go around them.

Looking at the objects again: the ball is at 4 steps right and 3 steps up. Maybe the ball is a distraction. The door is at 6 steps right and 2 steps up. Maybe the door needs to be opened, but there's no ""key is door"" or anything like that. The active rules are still key is win, wall is stop, and baba is you.

So the immediate goal is to reach the key. But the key is at 6 steps right and 4 steps up. The current player position (Baba) is at 2 steps left and 2 steps down relative to the observation's reference point. Wait, the ""rule `baba`"" is located 2 steps left and 2 steps down. So maybe the player is next to that rule. If I move right, I can get to the ""baba is you"" rule, but that's probably not necessary right now.

Alternatively, maybe I need to rearrange the rules. For example, if I can make ""baba is win"" instead of ""key is win,"" then reaching Baba (myself) would be the win condition. But how to do that?

The available text blocks are the key, is, win, wall, stop, door, and the rules for baba, is, you. The key is part of the ""key is win"" rule. To break that rule, I need to move the ""is"" or ""win"" text blocks. The ""is"" next to ""key"" is at 8 steps right and 4 steps up, and the ""win"" is at 9 steps right and 4 steps up. If I can move those, I could change the rule.

But to move any text block, it has to not be ""stop."" The current rules have ""wall is stop,"" so walls are immovable, but text blocks like ""is"" or ""win"" might be movable unless they are part of a rule that makes them stop. Wait, the rules are ""key is win,"" ""wall is stop,"" and ""baba is you."" So the text blocks ""is"" and ""win"" in the ""key is win"" rule are part of that rule, but since ""key is win"" is active, does that affect their movability? Probably not; the ""stop"" property is only on walls. So I should be able to move the ""is"" and ""win"" text blocks.

So the plan could be: move the ""is"" from the ""key is win"" rule to somewhere else, and move the ""win"" to become part of a new rule like ""baba is win."" Then, since I'm Baba and the rule would be ""baba is win,"" touching myself would make me win.

But how to do that step by step. Let's see. The current ""key is win"" rule is composed of the text blocks at 7 (key), 8 (is), and 9 (win) steps right and 4 steps up. To break this rule, I could move either the ""key,"" ""is,"" or ""win."" But moving ""key"" would just move the key itself, which might not help. Moving ""is"" would disconnect the ""key is"" part, making it just ""key"" and ""win"" separate. Similarly, moving ""win"" would leave ""key is"" and ""win"" separate.

Alternatively, to create a new rule ""baba is win,"" I need to have the text blocks ""baba,"" ""is,"" and ""win"" in proximity. The ""baba"" rule is located at 2 steps left and 2 steps down. The ""is"" is at 2 steps down (same as the ""baba is you"" rule's position). The ""win"" is at 9 steps right and 4 steps up, which is quite far.

So maybe first, I need to move the ""win"" text block closer to the ""baba"" and ""is"" text blocks. But moving the ""win"" would require moving it step by step. Since the player is at the position of the ""baba"" rule (2 steps left and 2 steps down), perhaps the best approach is to move right towards the ""win"" text block.

Looking at the current observation, the player (Baba) is at the position of the ""rule `baba`"" which is 2 steps left and 2 steps down. To move towards the ""win"" text block, which is 9 steps right and 4 steps up, the player would need to move right multiple times and up. However, there are walls blocking the path. For example, at 3 steps right and 4 steps up is a wall. So moving directly right and up might not work.

Alternatively, maybe the key is the win condition, so grabbing the key would make me win. But the key is behind walls. How can I reach the key? The key is at 6 steps right and 4 steps up. The wall at 3 steps right and 4 steps up is blocking that path. Since walls are stop, I can't move through them. So perhaps I need to move the wall? But walls are stop, so they can't be moved. Unless there's a way to change the ""wall is stop"" rule.

If I can change ""wall is stop"" to something else, then walls become movable. For example, if I make ""wall is push"" or remove the ""stop"" property. To do that, I need to edit the existing rule ""wall is stop."" The components of that rule are at 1 step left and 3 step up (wall), 3 step up (is), and 1 step right and 3 step up (stop). So to break this rule, I could move the ""is"" or ""stop"" text blocks.

If I move the ""is"" from ""wall is stop"" to another position, then the rule becomes ""wall stop,"" which might not make sense. Alternatively, moving the ""stop"" to another part to create a new rule. For instance, making ""stop is key"" or something. But that might not help.

Alternatively, focus on creating the ""baba is win"" rule. The ""baba"" text block is at 2 steps left and 2 steps down. The ""is"" is at 1 step left and 2 steps down, and the ""you"" is at 1 step right and 2 steps down. The ""win"" is at 9 steps right and 4 steps up. So to create ""baba is win,"" I need to bring the ""win"" next to ""baba"" and ""is.""

But the ""win"" is quite far. Maybe moving the ""win"" text block step by step. To move the ""win"" from 9 steps right and 4 steps up to a position near ""baba"" and ""is"" (which are at 2 steps left and 2 steps down), the player would have to move left and down multiple times while carrying the ""win"" text block. However, the player can only carry one text block at a time, I think.

Wait, in Baba Is You, you can push text blocks by moving towards them while adjacent, and if you move in a direction, you can push them if there's space behind them. But since walls are stop, you can't push them. So maybe the player can move the ""win"" text block by moving towards it and then moving in a direction, pushing it if possible.

But the ""win"" is at 9 steps right and 4 steps up. The player is at 2 steps left and 2 steps down. So the distance is quite large. Maybe there's a more efficient way.

Alternatively, let's look at the current rules again. The active rules are key is win, wall is stop, and baba is you. So the win condition is the key. But maybe there's a door that can be opened with the key. The door is at 6 steps right and 2 steps up. If I can open the door with the key, then going through the door would win. But the door's rule is ""rule `door` 7 steps to the right and 2 steps up."" There's no active rule defining the door's properties, except that it's a rule block. So unless there's a rule like ""door is unlock"" or something, the door might just be a static object.

Wait, the door is a separate object, but without any active rule, it's just a door. So maybe the key opens the door. But since the key is win, perhaps grabbing the key makes you win regardless of the door. But the key is behind walls. So how to get there.

Alternatively, maybe the solution is to move the ""key is win"" rule apart and create a new rule ""baba is win."" Let's try that approach.

First, the ""key is win"" rule is made of the key at 7 right,4 up; is at 8 right,4 up; win at 9 right,4 up. To break this rule, I can move any of these. If I move the ""is"" from this rule, then it becomes ""key win,"" which is not a valid rule. Similarly, moving ""win"" would leave ""key is,"" which is also not a rule. So perhaps better to move the ""win"" text block to create a new rule.

The ""baba is you"" rule is at 1 step left and 2 steps down (baba), 2 steps down (is), and 1 step right and 2 steps down (you). To make ""baba is win,"" I need to add the ""win"" text block next to these. So the plan is: move the ""win"" from 9 right,4 up to be adjacent to ""baba"" and ""is.""

But moving the ""win"" requires navigating through the map. The player is at the ""baba"" rule's position (2 left, 2 down). To get to the ""win"" at 9 right,4 up, the player needs to move right 11 steps and up 6 steps, but there are walls blocking the path. For example, at 3 right,4 up is a wall. So moving directly right and up isn't possible.

Alternatively, maybe there's a different path. Let's look at the wall positions:

- Wall at 4 right,4 up
- Wall at 4 right,3 up
- Wall at 4 right,2 up
- Wall at 4 right,1 up
- Wall at 4 right (same level)
- Wall at 4 right,1 down
- Etc.

So the right side from 4 steps right is blocked by walls from up to down. The key is at 6 right,4 up, which is two steps to the right of the wall at 4 right,4 up. So to reach the key, the player would need to go around the wall. But since walls are stop, the player can't move through them. Unless there's a way to move the wall.

Alternatively, if the ""wall is stop"" rule is changed, then walls become movable. For example, if we make ""wall is push"" or remove the ""stop,"" then walls can be moved. To do that, we need to edit the ""wall is stop"" rule. The components are at 1 left,3 up (wall), 3 up (is), 1 right,3 up (stop). So if we move the ""is"" or ""stop"" from this rule, we can change it.

For instance, if we move the ""stop"" text block to somewhere else, the rule becomes ""wall is,"" which is inactive. Then walls would no longer be stop. That would allow us to push walls. Then we could move the wall blocking the path to the key.

Alternatively, moving the ""is"" from ""wall is stop"" to create a new rule. For example, making ""wall stop is"" or something, but that's not valid. Probably better to remove the ""stop"" property from walls.

So the steps could be:

1. Move the ""stop"" text block from the ""wall is stop"" rule to a new position to create a new rule, thereby removing the ""stop"" property from walls.

But where to move the ""stop""? If we move it next to ""wall"" and ""is,"" it would form ""wall is stop"" again. Not helpful. Alternatively, move ""stop"" to be part of a new rule. For example, ""stop is key"" or ""stop is win."" But that might not help.

Alternatively, move the ""is"" from ""wall is stop"" to create ""wall stop,"" which is invalid, and then walls are just labeled ""wall stop,"" which doesn't have the ""stop"" property anymore. Then walls can be moved.

So, to do that:

- Move the ""is"" text block from the ""wall is stop"" rule (position 3 up) to elsewhere. For example, move it next to the ""key is win"" rule or somewhere else.

Once the ""is"" is moved, the ""wall stop"" would be left, but since there's no ""is"" connecting them, it's just two separate text blocks. Then walls would no longer be stop, allowing them to be pushed.

Once walls can be moved, the player can push the wall at 3 right,4 up out of the way to access the key.

But this seems like a lot of steps. Let's see if there's a more straightforward way.

Alternatively, since the key is the win condition, maybe the solution is to grab the key even if it's behind walls. But how?

Wait, in Baba Is You, sometimes you can walk over objects if they don't have the ""stop"" property. But walls are stop, so you can't walk through them. Unless the ""wall is stop"" rule is changed.

Another idea: if I can make the key a ""you"" object, then touching the key would make me win. But the current rule is ""key is win,"" so the key is the win object. If I change it to ""key is you,"" then touching the key would make me you, but since I'm already you (baba is you), that might not help. Or maybe ""baba is key,"" making me a key, which is win. But that requires creating new rules.

Alternatively, create a rule ""baba is win"" directly. To do that, need ""baba,"" ""is,"" and ""win"" adjacent.

The ""baba"" is at 2 left,2 down. The ""is"" is at 1 left,2 down. The ""win"" is at 9 right,4 up. It's quite far, but maybe possible to move the ""win"" text block step by step towards the ""baba"" and ""is.""

The player is at the ""baba"" rule's position. To move right, the player can move towards the right. But there's a wall at 4 right,4 up, but maybe if we can move that wall, we can create a path.

Alternatively, focus on moving the ""win"" text block. Let's see:

The player is at the position of the ""rule `baba`"" which is 2 left,2 down. To reach the ""win"" at 9 right,4 up, the player needs to move right 11 steps and up 6 steps, but there are obstacles.

Alternatively, look for a path around the walls. For example, move right until hitting a wall, then move up, but the walls are contiguous from 4 right upwards.

Alternatively, maybe the door at 6 right,2 up can be used. If the door can be opened with the key, and then going through it wins. But to open the door, there must be a rule like ""door is unlock key"" or something, but there's no such rule active.

Alternatively, since the key is win, maybe just grabbing the key is enough, regardless of the path. But how to reach it.

Wait, perhaps the key is not behind the walls but next to them. Let me check the positions again.

The key is at 8 steps right and 1 step up. The walls are at 4 right,1 up. So the key is 4 steps to the right of the wall at 4 right,1 up. So if I can move right past the wall at 4 right,1 up, but that wall is stop. Unless we can move it.

Alternatively, if we change the ""wall is stop"" rule, making walls movable, then we can push the wall at 4 right,1 up out of the way and reach the key.

So the steps would be:

1. Move the ""stop"" text block from the ""wall is stop"" rule to elsewhere, thereby removing the ""stop"" property from walls.
2. Move the wall at 4 right,1 up to the left or right, creating a path to the key.
3. Move to the key's position and grab it, winning the level.

But how to execute step 1.

The ""wall is stop"" rule is composed of:
- rule `wall` at 1 left,3 up

Let me try to figure out how to solve this Baba Is You level. The active rules are key is win, wall is stop, and baba is you. My goal is usually to reach the win object, which in this case is the key. But the key is right now defined as win, so maybe I need to get there first.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key located at 8 steps to the right and 4 steps up. Wait, no, in the current observation, the rule `win` is at 8 steps to the right and 4 steps up, which means the key is win because ""key is win"" is an active rule. So the key is both a key and the win object. That might mean that grabbing the key makes me win. But how do I get to it?

Looking at the walls, there's a wall 3 steps to the right and 4 steps up. Wait, no, in the current observation, the wall is 3 steps to the right and 4 step up. Wait, the wall is at 3 right, 4 up. The rule `key` is at 6 right, 4 up, then `is` at 7, 4, and `win` at 8, 4. So the key and the other rules are to the right of the wall. But since wall is stop, I can't move through it. But maybe I can rearrange the rules to change the stop property.

The player (Baba) is probably located at the position defined by the rules. The `baba` rule is at 2 steps left and 2 steps down from the wall at 3 right, 2 down. So adding those up: 3 right minus 2 left is 1 right, and 2 steps down from the wall at 3 right and 2 steps down would be 3 right, 4 down? Wait, maybe I need to visualize the map better.

Wait, the `rule 'baba'` is 2 steps to the left and 2 steps down from some position. The closest wall mentioned is at 3 steps right and 2 steps down. So the `baba` rule would be at (3 right - 2 left) = 1 right, and (2 steps down from that wall's position). The wall at 3 right and 2 steps down would be at, say, position (3, -2) if we consider the player's position as (0,0). Then the `baba` rule is 2 steps left (so 3 - 2 = 1) and 2 steps down from that wall's position. Wait, maybe the wall is at (3, -2), so the 'baba' rule is at (1, -4)? Not sure. Maybe it's easier to think that the player (Baba) is at the position defined by the 'baba is you' rule. Since the 'baba' rule is at 2 left and 2 down from the wall at 3 right and 2 down. So the wall is at (3, -2), then the 'baba' rule is 2 left (so 3-2=1) and 2 down from that wall's position. So the 'baba' rule's position is (1, -2 -2) = (1, -4). Therefore, the player (Baba) is at that position, which is (1, -4). 

So the player is at 1 right, 4 steps down. Now, the key is at 6 right, 4 up. There are walls blocking the path. For example, there's a wall at 3 right, 4 up. Also, other walls in between. The rules 'key', 'is', 'win' are all to the right of the wall at 3 right, 4 up. To get to the key, I need to move right, but the wall at 3 right, 4 up is stop. So I can't go through it. But maybe I can move the 'wall is stop' rule out of the way by rearranging the text blocks.

The 'wall is stop' rule is at 2 left and 3 step up from the wall at 3 right, 3 step up. Wait, in the current observation, the rule 'wall' is at 2 step to the left and 3 step up. The wall at 3 right, 3 step up is present. So the 'wall is stop' rule is at (3 - 2) = 1 right, and 3 up. So position (1, 3). The 'is' rule is at 1 step to the left and 3 step up, so (0, 3), and 'stop' is at 3 step up. Wait, maybe I need to check again.

The active rules are key is win, wall is stop, baba is you. The objects include the rules as separate entities. For example, the rule `wall` is at 2 step to the left and 3 step up. So if the wall is at 3 right and 3 step up, then the 'wall' rule is at (3 - 2) = 1 right, 3 up. The 'is' rule is at 1 step to the left and 3 step up from that wall's position? Or from another point? This is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should focus on the positions given.

The rule `wall` is located at 2 step to the left and 3 step up from some reference point. Let's assume that the reference point is the wall at 3 right and 3 step up. So the 'wall' rule is at (3 - 2) = 1 right, 3 up. Then the 'is' rule is at 1 step to the left and 3 step up, so (1 -1) = 0 right, 3 up. And 'stop' is at 3 step up. Wait, the rule `stop` is 1 step to the right and 3 step up from where? Maybe from the 'is' rule's position. So (0 +1, 3) = 1 right, 3 up. But that's the same position as the 'wall' rule. That can't be right. Hmm, maybe the positions are all relative to the player's position or another wall.

This is getting too complicated. Let's think differently. The key is at 6 steps to the right and 4 steps up. To reach it, I need to move right and up, but there's a wall blocking the path at 3 steps right and 4 step up. Since wall is stop, I can't pass through. But maybe I can move the 'wall is stop' rule to change the wall's property. For example, if I can change wall to not stop, then I can move through it. But how?

The 'wall is stop' rule is a text block that can be moved. To do that, I need to move the individual words 'wall', 'is', 'stop' and rearrange them. But the problem is that some objects are stop, meaning I can't move them. Wait, the rules state that you can only move objects or text that are not defined as ""STOP"" or similar immovable properties. So if a text block is part of a rule that makes it stop, like 'stop is stop', then it's immovable. But in this case, the active rules are key is win, wall is stop, baba is you. So the 'stop' text block is part of the 'wall is stop' rule, which makes it stop. So I can't move the 'stop' text block. But the 'wall' and 'is' in the 'wall is stop' rule—are they movable?

The 'wall' rule is at 2 step left and 3 up. The 'is' is at 1 step left and 3 up. The 'stop' is at 3 step up. So maybe those text blocks (wall, is, stop) are separate and can be moved if they're not part of a STOP rule. Wait, the 'stop' in the 'wall is stop' rule is part of that rule, so it's considered stop? Or is the entire rule considered stop? The game's rules say that if an object is defined as stop, you can't move it. So if the text block 'stop' is part of a rule that makes it stop, then it's immovable. But the 'wall' and 'is' in the 'wall is stop' rule—are they stop? No, the 'wall' is defined as stop via the rule, but the 'wall' text block itself is not stop unless there's a rule saying 'text is stop'. So I think the 'wall' and 'is' text blocks are movable, but the 'stop' text block is part of a rule that makes it stop, so it's immovable.

Therefore, I can move the 'wall' and 'is' text blocks from the 'wall is stop' rule to create a new rule. For example, if I can move 'wall', 'is', and another 'stop' (but there's no other 'stop' block except the one in the existing rule), maybe I can create a new rule like 'stop is you', which would make stop objects movable. But how?

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule that changes the stop property. For instance, if I can create 'stop is you', then stop objects would become you, allowing me to move through them. But to do that, I need to have the necessary text blocks: 'stop', 'is', 'you'. Looking at the objects, there's a 'you' rule at 2 steps down. The 'you' rule is part of the 'baba is you' rule, located at 1 step right and 2 steps down. So the 'you' text block is there. The 'is' text blocks are present at various positions. The 'stop' text block is part of the existing 'wall is stop' rule and is immovable. So I can't get another 'stop' block to make 'stop is you'.

Alternatively, maybe I can rearrange the existing 'wall is stop' rule. If I can change it to 'stop is wall', then walls would become stop, but that doesn't help. Or if I change 'wall is stop' to 'wall is you', then walls would be you, allowing me to move through them. But to do that, I need to move the 'wall', 'is', and 'you' text blocks. The 'you' is available. So the steps would be:

1. Move the 'wall' text block from the 'wall is stop' rule to somewhere else.
2. Move the 'is' text block from the 'wall is stop' rule to connect with 'wall' and 'you'.

But how to do that in the game? The player needs to move these text blocks adjacent to each other to form a new rule. The player's current position is at the 'baba' rule's location, which is 2 steps left and 2 steps down from the wall at 3 right and 2 steps down. So the player's position is (3 - 2) = 1 right, and (2 steps down from the wall's position at, say, 3 right and 2 down would be 3 right, 2 + 2 = 4 down? Not sure. Maybe it's better to think in coordinates. Let's assume the player is at (0,0). Then the wall at 3 right and 4 up is at (3,4). The 'rule `key`' is at 7 right and 4 up, which would be (7,4). The 'baba' rule is at 1 left and 2 down from some position. If the wall at 3 right and 2 down is at (3, -2), then the 'baba' rule is at (3 - 2, -2 -2) = (1, -4). So the player is at (1, -4).

To reach the key at (7,4), the player needs to move right and up, but there are walls in the way. For example, a wall at (3,4), which is the same as the position of the 'rule `wall`' at 2 left and 3 up. Wait, this is getting too confusing with coordinates. Let's try another approach.

The key is at 6 right, 4 up. The player is at 1 right, 4 down. So to get to the key, need to move right 5 steps and up 8 steps. But there are walls blocking the path. Specifically, a wall at 3 right, 4 up (which is the same as the position of the 'rule `wall`' at 2 left and 3 up from the wall at 3 right, 3 up). So that wall is blocking the direct path.

To pass through that wall, I need to change it from stop to something else. The only way to do that is to modify the 'wall is stop' rule. Since the 'stop' in that rule is immovable, I can't directly change it. However, maybe I can create a new rule that overrides it. For example, if I can make 'wall is you', then walls would be you, allowing me to move through them.

To create 'wall is you', I need the text blocks 'wall', 'is', and 'you'. The 'you' is available at 2 steps down (the 'rule `you`' is at 2 steps down). The 'wall' and 'is' are part of the existing 'wall is stop' rule. Since 'wall' and 'is' are not stop (only 'stop' in that rule is stop), I can move them.

So the plan is:

1. Move the 'wall' text block from the 'wall is stop' rule to a position where it can be part of a new rule.
2. Move the 'is' text block from the 'wall is stop' rule to connect with 'wall' and 'you'.
3. Form the new rule 'wall is you', making walls passable.

Once that's done, I can walk through the wall and reach the key.

But how to do this step by step in the game? Let's see. The player is at (1, -4). The 'wall' text block from the 'wall is stop' rule is at 2 left and 3 up from where? Let's assume the 'wall is stop' rule is formed by the text blocks 'wall' at (1,3), 'is' at (0,3), and 'stop' at (1,3) again? Not sure. Maybe the 'wall' rule is at (1,3), 'is' at (0,3), and 'stop' at (1,4). This is getting too ambiguous without a visual map.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is to realize that since the key is defined as win, picking it up will make me win. So maybe I need to get to the key, which is at 6 right, 4 up. The path is blocked by a wall at 3 right, 4 up. To move that wall, I need to change its rule. Since I can't move the 'stop' block, maybe I can create a new rule that makes the wall a different property. For example, 'wall is push' or 'wall is you'.

But to create 'wall is you', I need the 'you' text block. The 'you' is at 2 steps down. The player is at (1, -4). The 'you' rule is at 2 steps down from somewhere. If the 'you' rule is at (1, -4 + 2) = (1, -2), then the 'you' text block is there. So the player needs to move right and up to that position.

Wait, the 'rule `you`' is located at 1 step to the right and 2 steps down from the 'baba' rule. The 'baba' rule is at 1 step left and 2 steps down from the wall at 3 right and 2 steps down. So the 'baba' rule is at (3 -1, 2 -2) = (2, 0). Then the 'you' rule is at (2 +1, 0 -2) = (3, -2). So the 'you' text block is at (3, -2).

The player is at (2, 0) based on the 'baba' rule's position. Wait, this is getting too convoluted. Maybe I should focus on the available text blocks and their positions.

The 'you' text block is at 1 step to the right and 2 steps down from the 'baba' rule. The 'baba' rule is at 1 step left and 2 steps down from the wall at 3 right and 2 steps down. So the wall is at (3, -2). The 'baba' rule is at (3 -1, -2 -2) = (2, -4). Then the 'you' rule is at (2 +1, -4 -2) = (3, -6). Wait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm miscalculating.

Alternatively, perhaps the positions are relative to each other. For example, the 'rule `baba`' is 1 step left and 2 steps down from the wall at 3 right and 2 steps down. So the wall is at (3, -2), and the 'baba' rule is at (3 -1, -2 -2) = (2, -4). Then the 'rule `is`' at 2 steps down is at (2, -4 -2) = (2, -6). The 'rule `you`' is at 1 step to the right and 2 steps down from the 'baba' rule, so (2 +1, -4 -2) = (3, -6). The 'you' text block is there.

The player is at the position of the 'baba' entity, which is defined by the 'baba is you' rule. So the player is at (2, -4).

The key is at 6 steps to the right and 4 steps up from where? If the wall is at (3, -2), then 6 steps to the right would be (3 +6, -2) = (9, -2), and 4 steps up would be (9, -2 +4) = (9, 2). So the key is at (9, 2).

But there's a wall at 3 steps to the right and 4 steps up from the original wall. So the wall is at (3 +3, -2 +4) = (6, 2). That wall is blocking the path.

To get past this wall, I need to change its rule. The 'wall is stop' rule is made up of the text blocks 'wall', 'is', and 'stop'. The 'wall' text block is part of this","

Let me try to figure this out. The goal is to get the key and possibly the door, but the active rule says ""key is win,"" so maybe grabbing the key makes me the win condition? Or maybe I need to reach the door. The current rules are key is win, wall is stop, and baba is you. So as Baba, I can move around unless there's a wall.

Looking at the objects, there's a key at 7 steps right, 1 step up from me. But there's a wall at 8 steps right, 1 step up, so maybe that's blocking the path. Also, there's a door at 6 steps right, 2 steps up. But how do I get past the walls? The rule ""wall is stop"" means I can't move into them. But since I'm Baba, maybe I can push other objects if they're not stop. Wait, the stop property is on the walls, so maybe other objects can be moved.

Looking at the rules, rule `wall` is at different positions. There's a rule `wall` at 2 steps left and 3 step up. If I can move that text block, maybe I can change the definition of wall. But the rule says ""wall is stop,"" so if I can change that rule, perhaps walls aren't stop anymore. But how?

First, I need to locate the text blocks. The key, is, win are grouped on the right side. The wall rules are at different positions. To manipulate the rules, I need to move the text blocks ""wall"", ""is"", and ""you"" etc. Since I'm Baba (baba is you), I can move objects unless they're stop. The walls are stop, so I can't move them directly. But maybe I can move other text blocks that aren't stop.

Wait, the rule `stop` is at 3 step up. If I can move that ""stop"" text block, maybe I can remove the stop property from walls. Let's see: the rule `stop` is at 1 step to the right and 3 step up. Wait, in the current observation, the rule `stop` is at 3 step up. Looking back at the objects list:

rule `stop` 3 step up

So that's a text block saying ""stop"" is somewhere. If I can move that ""stop"" text block away, then the rule ""wall is stop"" would no longer be valid, making walls not stop. Then I could move through the walls.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule that makes Baba have the win property. Since ""key is win"" is active, if I can make ""baba is win"", then touching the key would make me win. But how?

To do that, I need to move the ""win"" text block. The current ""win"" rule is at 8 steps right, 4 step up. If I can bring that ""win"" text block next to ""baba"" and ""is"", forming ""baba is win"", then that would change the rules.

But moving those text blocks requires being able to move them. The text blocks are not stop unless they're part of a stop rule. Right now, walls are stop, but other objects like the rules might not be. Let's check the active rules again: wall is stop, key is win, baba is you. So the ""is"" and ""you"" text blocks aren't stop, so I can move them.

So the plan could be:

1. Move the ""is"" text block that's at 3 step up (from the wall rule) to the position next to ""baba"" and ""win"", creating ""baba is win"".

But where is Baba located? Looking at the objects: there's a rule `baba` 1 step to the left and 2 steps down. So Baba is at that position. So if I can move the ""is"" and ""win"" text blocks next to Baba, I can create the new rule.

Alternatively, maybe first I need to move the ""key"" text block. But the key is at 6 steps right, 4 step up. Wait, the key is part of the ""key is win"" rule. The key is at 6 right, 4 up, and the ""is"" and ""win"" are to the right of it. So the rule is ""key is win"".

To pick up the key, as Baba, I need to move to its position. But the path might be blocked by walls. Let's see:

From my current position (assuming I'm Baba at 2 step left and 2 steps down?), maybe I need to navigate to the key. But the walls are at 3 steps right and various positions. Alternatively, maybe moving the wall rules out of the way.

Wait, perhaps the key is at 7 steps right and 4 step up. But there's a wall at 8 steps right and 1 step up. Maybe I need to go down to reach the key. Let me visualize the map.

Alternatively, since ""key is win"", maybe just grabbing the key makes me the win condition. So if I can move to the key's location and take it, then I win. But how to get there?

The key is at 7 steps right, 1 step up. There's a wall at 3 steps right and 1 step up. Wait, the walls are at 4 steps right in various positions. Maybe the key is behind a wall. If I can remove the wall's stop property, then I can move through.

So the steps could be:

1. Move the ""stop"" rule away to remove the wall's stop property.
2. Then navigate to the key and pick it up, which would make me win because ""key is win"".

But how to move the ""stop"" rule. The ""stop"" rule is at 3 step up. Looking at the objects list:

rule `stop` 3 step up

So it's a text block saying ""stop"" located 3 steps up. Since it's not part of a wall, and the only stop property is from the wall rule, maybe I can move this ""stop"" text block. If I can move it away, then the wall's stop property remains, but perhaps the stop rule is just a text block that can be moved.

Wait, the rules are formed by text blocks in the format ""[Subject] IS [Property]"". So the ""stop"" text block by itself isn't a rule. The active rule ""wall is stop"" is made by the text blocks ""wall"", ""is"", and ""stop"" arranged as a rule. So if I can move the ""stop"" text block, perhaps I can break that rule.

Alternatively, if I can create a new rule that makes ""baba"" have the ""stop"" property, but that's probably bad because then I can't move.

Alternatively, the main goal is to get to the key, which is win. So maybe just moving to the key's location. But the path might be blocked by walls. For example, from where I am, to reach the key at 7 right, 1 up, I need to move down and right. But there's a wall at 4 steps right in various positions. Let's check the walls:

Looking at the objects:

- wall 4 steps to the right and 4 step up
- wall 4 steps to the right and 3 step up
- wall 4 steps to the right and 2 step up
- wall 4 steps to the right and 1 step up
- wall 4 steps to the right
- wall 4 steps to the right and 1 step down
- wall 4 steps to the right and 2 steps down

So there's a wall forming a vertical line at 4 steps right from up to down. The key is at 7 steps right, 1 step up, which is outside that wall. So maybe the path is clear to the right. But Baba's current position is at rule `baba` 1 step to the left and 2 steps down. So that's 1 step left from the starting point, 2 steps down. To get to the key at 7 right, 1 up, I might need to move right multiple times and up.

But how to navigate around the walls. The walls are at 4 right, so moving right from Baba's position (assuming Baba is at, say, position (0,0)), then moving right 1 step would be to (1,0), then (2,0), then (3,0), but there's a wall at 4 steps right. Wait, the walls are at 4 steps right in various directions. So from Baba's position (1 left, 2 down), moving right would be towards 4 steps right. But there's a wall at 4 right, so if I try to move right past 4, I hit a stop wall. So I can't go through the wall at 4 right.

Therefore, I need to find another way around. Maybe by moving the wall rule's text blocks. For example, the rule ""wall is stop"" is formed by the text blocks at 1 step left and 3 up (rule `wall`), then rule `is` at 3 up, and rule `stop` at 3 up. So those three text blocks form the ""wall is stop"" rule. If I can move the ""wall"" text block away, then the rule is broken, and walls might no longer be stop.

But to move those text blocks, I need to be able to move them. Since the ""is"" and ""you"" text blocks aren't stop, perhaps they can be moved. So for example, the ""is"" text block at 3 step up is part of the ""wall is stop"" rule. If I move that ""is"" text block, the rule breaks.

Alternatively, create a new rule that makes ""baba"" have the ""win"" property. The current ""key is win"" rule is active. If I can make ""baba is win"", then touching the key would make me win. Or just having the rule ""baba is win"" would make Baba the win condition regardless of the key.

To create ""baba is win"", I need to move the ""baba"" text block, the ""is"" text block, and the ""win"" text block together. The ""baba"" rule is at 1 step left and 2 steps down. The ""is"" text block is at 1 step left and 2 steps down (the same position as the ""baba"" rule's ""is"")? Wait, looking at the objects:

rule `baba` 1 step to the left and 2 steps down
rule `is` 2 steps down
rule `you` 1 step to the right and 2 steps down

So the ""baba is you"" rule is formed by the ""baba"" text block at 1 left 2 down, ""is"" at 2 down, and ""you"" at 1 right 2 down.

To create ""baba is win"", I need to place the ""win"" text block next to them. The ""win"" text block is at 8 steps right, 4 step up. That's quite far from Baba's position. So maybe I need to move the ""win"" text block down to where Baba is.

But moving the ""win"" text block would require navigating to its location, which is 8 right, 4 up. From Baba's current position (1 left, 2 down), moving up 4 steps and right 8 steps would be difficult due to the walls at 4 steps right. Unless there's a path around.

Alternatively, maybe the key is the way. If I can pick up the key, then because ""key is win"", having the key makes me win. So how to pick up the key. To pick up an object in Baba Is You, you usually move onto it. So if I move to the key's position, I would grab it, and since ""key is win"", I would become the win condition.

The key is at 7 steps right, 1 step up. So from Baba's position (1 left, 2 down), moving right 8 steps and up 3 steps. But the walls at 4 steps right block movement beyond that. So I need to get around the walls.

Alternatively, perhaps moving the wall rules. For example, the rule ""wall is stop"" is made by the text blocks at 1 left 3 up (rule `wall`), then ""is"" at 3 up, and ""stop"" at 3 up. If I can break that rule by moving one of those text blocks, then walls are no longer stop.

For example, if I move the ""stop"" text block away from the ""is"" and ""wall"" text blocks, the ""wall is stop"" rule is no longer active. Then walls are not stop, so I can move through them.

The ""stop"" text block is at 3 step up. So from Baba's position (1 left, 2 down), moving up 3 steps would reach the ""stop"" text block. But there are walls at 4 steps right in various positions. I need to find a path to the ""stop"" text block.

Alternatively, maybe move horizontally first. From Baba's position (1 left, 2 down), move right to reach 4 steps right, but that's a wall. So can't go through. Maybe move down to avoid the walls.

Looking at the map structure, it seems there's a vertical wall at 4 steps right from up to down. The key is outside this wall at 7 steps right. So to reach the key, I need to get past the wall at 4 steps right. If I can make walls not stop, then I can move through them.

So the plan is:

1. Move the ""stop"" text block away to break the ""wall is stop"" rule.
2. Then navigate through the wall at 4 steps right to reach the key.
3. Grab the key, which makes me win because ""key is win"".

To move the ""stop"" text block:

The ""stop"" rule is at 3 step up. So from Baba's position (1 left, 2 down), moving up 3 steps would get to the ""stop"" text block. But the path might be blocked. Let's see:

Baba is at 1 left, 2 down. To move up 3 steps, need to move up once to 1 left, 1 down, then up to 1 left, 0 down, then up to 1 left, -1 down (assuming down is negative). But are there walls in the way?

Looking at the walls:

- wall 4 steps to the right and 4 step up
- wall 4 steps to the right and 3 step up
- wall 4 steps to the right and 2 step up
- wall 4 steps to the right and 1 step up
- wall 4 steps to the right
- wall 4 steps to the right and 1 step down
- wall 4 steps to the right and 2 steps down

So moving up from Baba's position (1 left, 2 down) towards the ""stop"" text block at 3 step up. Let's assume the coordinate system where up is positive y, right is positive x.

Baba's position: x = -1, y = -2 (1 left, 2 down).

The ""stop"" text block is at 3 step up, which would be y = 3.

Moving up from y=-2 to y=3 requires passing through y=-1, 0, 1, 2, 3.

Check for walls in those positions:

At y=3 (3 step up), there's a wall at 4 steps right, 3 step up. So at x=4, y=3, there's a wall. But Baba is at x=-1, so moving up along y-axis shouldn't hit that wall unless moving right.

Wait, the walls are at x=4, various y. So moving up from Baba's position (x=-1, y=-2) to y=3, x remains -1. There are no walls at x=-1 along that path. So moving up is possible.

So the steps would be:

1. Move up three times to reach y=3, x=-1.
2. At y=3, there's a rule `stop` text block. Since it's not part of a wall, I can move it.
3. Move the ""stop"" text block away, say to the right, changing its position so it's no longer connected to the ""wall is stop"" rule.
4. Now walls are no longer stop, so I can move through them.
5. Navigate from x=-1, y=3 to the key's position at x=7, y=1.

But this seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe there's a simpler path.

Alternatively, create a new rule ""baba is win"" by moving the ""win"" text block next to ""baba"" and ""is"".

The ""win"" text block is at x=8, y=4. To get there from Baba's position (x=-1, y=-2), need to move right 9 steps and up 6 steps, which is blocked by the wall at x=4. So unless I can move through walls (which I can't if they're stop), this is difficult.

Another approach: since the key is win, maybe just move to the key's position and grab it, assuming I can path there.

The key is at x=7, y=1. From Baba's position (x=-1, y=-2):

Move right to x=0, then x=1, x=2, x=3. At x=3, there's a wall at y=1 (key is at y=1, x=7). Wait, the walls are at x=4, various y. So moving right from x=3 to x=4 is blocked by a wall. So to get past x=4, I need to move around it. But if walls are stop, I can't.

So unless I break the ""wall is stop"" rule by moving the ""stop"" text block, I can't get past x=4.

So the key steps are:

- Move to the ""stop"" text block at x=-1, y=3.
- Move it away, say to x=0, y=3.
- Now walls are not stop, so I can move right through x=4.
- Navigate to the key at x=7, y=1.

But how to move the ""stop"" text block. From x=-1, y=3, I need to grab the ""stop"" text block and move it. Since it's a text block, I can move it by stepping onto it and moving in a direction.

So the actions would be:

1. Move up three times to reach y=3.
2. Move right to x=0, y=3 (to avoid the wall at x=4).
3. Move the ""stop"" text block to a new position, say left to x=-2, y=3.
4. Now walls are no longer stop.
5. Move right through x=4, y=1 to reach the key","

Let's try to figure out what the correct action here is. The active rules are key is win, wall is stop, and baba is you. So, normally, I need to get to the key to win, but the key is considered a win object, so maybe that's the target.

Looking at the objects, the key is at 7 steps to the right and 1 step up. But there's a wall at 3 steps right and 1 step up. Wait, the rule says wall is stop, so I can't move through walls. But how do I get past the wall? Maybe I need to rearrange the rules. 

The rules are scattered around. There's a rule ""key is win"" and ""wall is stop"". If I can move the ""win"" text next to ""baba"", then maybe I can change the rule to make baba the win. That way, reaching baba would be the solution. 

Looking at the positions, the rule `baba` is 2 steps left and 2 steps down from the current position. The `is` and `you` rules are nearby. If I can move the `you` next to `baba` and `is`, forming ""baba is you"", but wait, that's already a rule. The active rule is ""baba is you"". So maybe I need to change the win condition. 

The key is win, but maybe if I make ""baba is win"", then touching baba would win. The `key` is at 7 right, 4 up, and `win` is at 8 right, 4 up. The `is` is at 7 right, 4 up. So if I can move the `win` text next to `key` and `is` to form ""key is win"", but that's already the case. Wait, the active rule is already key is win. 

Alternatively, maybe the door is relevant. There's a rule `door` at 6 right, 2 up. But I don't know if that's a stop or not. The wall is stop, but door isn't mentioned. Maybe if I can push the door away or change its property. 

Wait, the ball is at 4 right, 3 up. Not sure if that's important. The main goal is to reach the key, but the key is behind a wall. Since walls are stop, I can't go through them. So I need to either move the wall or change its property. 

To move a wall, I need to possibly change its rule. The rule ""wall is stop"" is at 1 left and 3 up. If I can move that rule away and create a new rule like ""wall is push"" or something, but I don't see a ""push"" text block. Alternatively, if I can make the wall not stop. 

But how do I move the text blocks? I need to be a ""you"" entity, which I am because of ""baba is you"". So I can move objects that aren't stop. The walls are stop, so I can't move them. But the rules are not stop unless specified. Let me check the active rules: wall is stop, but there's no rule saying rule is stop. So I can move the rule blocks. 

The key is to rearrange the text blocks to create a new rule. The current active rules are key is win, wall is stop, baba is you. To win, normally you need to get the key, but maybe the solution is to make baba the win. 

So, the `baba` rule is at 2 left and 2 down. The `is` is at 1 left and 2 down, and `you` is at 2 down. If I can move the `you` next to `baba` and `is`, forming ""baba is you"", but that's already the case. Wait, maybe I need to create a new rule like ""baba is win"". 

The `win` text block is at 8 right, 4 up. The `is` is at 7 right, 4 up. The `baba` rule is at 2 left and 2 down. So perhaps I need to move the `win` down to where the `baba`, `is`, and `you` are. 

But how to do that? Since I'm baba, I can move objects that aren't stop. The rules are not stop, so I can move them. The `win` rule is 8 right, 4 up. I need to move it down to the area where the `baba`, `is`, and `you` are located, which is 2 left and 2 down. 

So the sequence would be: move the `win` rule down and left to form ""baba is win"". That way, touching baba would make you win. Then, since I'm baba, I can just stand there and win. 

Looking at the current positions, the `win` is at 8 right, 4 up. To get to the area of the `baba` rule (2 left, 2 down), I need to move left and down. But the movement is per step. So perhaps move left from the current position multiple times, then down. 

Wait, the current position of the player (Baba) is not explicitly stated, but based on the rules, the `baba` rule is at 2 left and 2 down from some reference point. Maybe the player is at the position of the Baba object. The `baba` rule is at 2 step to the left and 2 steps down. So the player (Baba) is likely at that position. 

So to get the `win` rule to the area of `baba`, `is`, and `you`, I need to move the `win` rule left and down. The `win` is at 8 right, 4 up. To get to 2 left and 2 down, I need to move left 10 steps and down 6 steps, which isn't feasible. Maybe there's a closer path. 

Wait, perhaps the key is not the real win. The active rule says key is win, but maybe the actual win is somewhere else. Alternatively, the door might be a win if I can open it. But there's a rule `door` at 6 right, 2 up. If I can change the door's property to win, that could work. 

But how? To create a rule like ""door is win"", I need to move `door`, `is`, and `win` together. The `door` rule is at 6 right, 2 up. The `is` is at 7 right, 4 up. The `win` is at 8 right, 4 up. It's a bit scattered. Maybe moving the `is` down to the `door` location. 

Alternatively, the ball is present. Not sure. Let me recap:

Current active rules:
- key is win
- wall is stop
- baba is you

Objects:
- Key is at 7 right, 1 up (behind a wall at 3 right, 1 up)
- Wall at 3 right, 1 up (stop)
- Baba's rule at 2 left, 2 down
- door rule at 6 right, 2 up

Solution steps:
1. Need to access the key, but blocked by wall.
2. To move the wall, need to change its rule from ""wall is stop"" to something else. But there's no ""push"" or ""move"" text.
3. Alternative: Make Baba the win by creating ""baba is win"" rule.
   - To do this, need to move the `win` text next to `baba` and `is`.
   - The `win` is at 8 right, 4 up. `baba` rule is at 2 left, 2 down. The `is` is at 7 right, 4 up.
   - This seems too far. Maybe there's a closer way.

Another angle: The key is win, but maybe the actual win is elsewhere. If I can pick up the key (since I'm you), but the key is win, so picking it up would make me win? Wait, in Baba Is You, if you have the WIN property, touching it would make you win. But the key is WIN, so if I can move to the key, which is WIN, then touching it would win. But the key is behind a wall.

Alternatively, the door might be a way out. If I can push the door, but doors are usually pushable unless stopped. Since wall is stop, but door isn't mentioned. So maybe pushing the door out of the way. But how?

Wait, the `door` rule is at 6 right, 2 up. If I can create a rule that makes door not stop, then I could push it. But I don't have a ""no stop"" rule. Alternatively, change the wall's rule to not stop.

But to move the ""wall is stop"" rule, I need to touch it and move it. Since walls are stop, I can't move them, but the rule itself is not a wall. The rule ""wall is stop"" is a separate object. So as Baba (you), I can move that rule.

The ""wall is stop"" rule is at 1 step to the left and 3 step up. If I can move that rule away, then walls would not be stop anymore. Then I could move through walls. But how to do that?

So the plan would be:
1. Move the ""wall is stop"" rule to a different position, effectively removing the rule.
2. Then, walls are no longer stop, so I can walk through them and get the key.

But to move the ""wall is stop"" rule, I need to be adjacent to it and move left or up/down. The rule is at 1 left, 3 up. The player (Baba) is at 2 left, 2 down. So the distance between them is 3 steps left and 1 step up. To reach the ""wall is stop"" rule, I need to move left 3 steps and up 1 step. But each move is one step. So from the player's position (assuming it's at the `baba` rule's position: 2 left, 2 down), moving left 3 steps would get to 5 left, 2 down. Then up 1 step to 5 left, 3 down. But the ""wall is stop"" rule is at 1 left, 3 up, which is 1 left and 1 up from the player's starting position. Wait, maybe coordinates are different. This part is confusing without a map visual.

Alternatively, maybe the best approach is to create a new rule that makes Baba the win. To do that, need to move the `win` text next to `baba` and `is`. The `win` is at 8 right, 4 up. The `baba` rule is at 2 left, 2 down. The `is` is at 7 right, 4 up. It's a bit spread out. Maybe move the `win` down and left. 

But how to move the `win` rule? Since I'm Baba (you), I can move any object that's not stop. The `win` rule isn't stop, so I can pick it up and move it. The goal is to get it next to `baba` and `is`. 

The `baba` rule is at 2 left, 2 down. The `is` is at 7 right, 4 up. The `win` is at 8 right, 4 up. So to form ""baba is win"", I need to move the `win` to the left and down. From 8 right, 4 up to somewhere near 2 left, 2 down. That's a distance of 10 left and 2 down. That's a lot of steps. Maybe there's a shorter path.

Alternatively, maybe the key is not necessary. Since the active rule says key is win, perhaps picking up the key makes you win. But the key is behind a wall. If I can move the wall's rule, then the wall isn't stop anymore, and I can go through it. 

So the steps would be:
1. Move the ""wall is stop"" rule away.
2. Walk through the wall to get the key, which is win.

But how to move the ""wall is stop"" rule. The rule is at 1 left, 3 up. The player (Baba) is at 2 left, 2 down. To get to the ""wall is stop"" rule, need to move left once and up once. So from 2 left, 2 down, move left to 1 left, 2 down, then up to 1 left, 3 down? Wait, directions might be different. Maybe the coordinate system is relative. This part is getting too confusing without a visual map.

Alternatively, maybe the solution is simpler. Since the key is win, and I'm Baba, if I can get the key, I win. But the key is at 7 right, 1 up, behind a wall at 3 right, 1 up. The player (Baba) is at 2 left, 2 down. So to reach the key, need to move right 9 steps and up 3 steps, but there's a wall at 3 right, 1 up. If I can remove the wall's stop property, then I can move through it.

To remove ""wall is stop"", I need to move that rule. The rule is at 1 left, 3 up. So from the player's position (2 left, 2 down), moving left 1 step to 1 left, 2 down, then up 1 step to 1 left, 3 down. Wait, but the rule is at 1 left, 3 up, which is diagonally up and left from the player's position. So maybe move left and up. 

Each move is one step in a direction. So to get from 2 left, 2 down to 1 left, 3 up, the player needs to move left once and up three times. But the rule is at that position. So if the player moves left and up towards the rule, they can pick it up and move it elsewhere. 

Once the ""wall is stop"" rule is moved, walls are no longer stop, so the player can walk through them and get the key, which is win. 

So the action sequence would be:
1. Move left to reach the ""wall is stop"" rule.
2. Move the rule away.
3. Move right through the now non-stop wall to get the key.

But how to execute this in the game's terms. Each action is a single step. The player needs to navigate to the rule's location and then move it.

Given the current observation, the ""wall is stop"" rule is at 1 step to the left and 3 step up from the player's position (assuming player is at the `baba` rule's location). So the player needs to move left once and up three times to reach the rule. Then, once adjacent, they can move the rule in a direction, say left again, to remove it from the active rules.

After that, the player can move right past the wall (now not stop) to reach the key at 7 right, 1 up. 

But in the current observation, after moving the ""wall is stop"" rule, the player would then go to the key. However, the key is at 7 right, 1 up, and the player is now past the wall. So the path would be possible.

Therefore, the first action needed is to move towards the ""wall is stop"" rule. The player is at 2 left, 2 down. The rule is at 1 left, 3 up. So the direction to move is left and up. 

But how to translate that into a single step action. The possible actions are up, down, left, right, or idle. 

The player needs to move left once to get to 1 left, 2 down, then up once to reach 1 left, 3 down. Wait, but the rule is at 1 left, 3 up, which is diagonally up and left from the player's starting position. Maybe the coordinate system is such that up and left are separate axes. 

Alternatively, perhaps the player's position is relative to the map's starting point. Without the exact map layout, it's challenging, but based on the objects' positions, the key is to the right and up from the player's current position, but blocked by a wall.

Given the confusion in coordinates, the safest bet might be to move left to reach the rule and then move it away. So the first action is to move left.

Let's see. I need to figure out how to solve this Baba Is You level. The active rules are key is win, wall is stop, and baba is you. My goal is usually to reach the win object, but since key is win, I guess I need to get the key first.

Looking at the objects on the map, the key is at 8 steps to the right and 1 step up. There are walls all around, so I have to move carefully. Also, there's a ball at 5 steps right and 3 up, but I'm not sure if that's relevant yet. The door is at 7 right and 2 up, which might be blocking the way to the key.

Since I'm controlled by Baba, and baba is you, I can move around. But walls are stop, so I can't go through them. The problem is that the key is behind a wall (4 right, 1 up) and another wall at 4 right, 2 up with a door. The door might be stop unless I change a rule. 

The key is win, so if I can get the key, then maybe I can use it to win. But how? The key is at 8 right, 1 up. To get there, I need to move right from my current position. Wait, where is Baba located? The observation lists the rules and objects but not Baba's position directly. Hmm, the rules mention ""rule `baba` 1 step to the left and 2 steps down"" which probably places Baba there. Let me visualize the map.

Assuming Baba is at that position (1 left, 2 down from somewhere?), but to move right, I need to check if the path is clear. Let's see: Starting from Baba's position, if I move right, would I hit a wall? Looking at the walls: there's a wall at 4 right, 4 up; but that's probably not on my current path. Wait, the walls are spread out. The key is at 8 right, 1 up. So from Baba's position (1 left, 2 down), moving right would require passing through various obstacles.

Alternatively, maybe I can rearrange the rules. The key is win, so if I can change that rule, maybe I can make Baba win instead. For example, if I can make ""baba is win"" by moving the text blocks. The current rule for key is at 7 right, 4 up, followed by ""is"" at 8 right, 4 up, and ""win"" at 9 right, 4 up. So the rule is ""key is win"". To change this, I need to move ""key"" to another spot and form a new rule.

But to move those text blocks, I have to make sure they're not stopped. The wall is stop, but the key, is, and win blocks are probably movable unless they're part of an active rule. Since ""key is win"" is an active rule, can I move the ""key"" block? The rule states ""wall is stop"", so any rule that says stop applies. The key block isn't stopped unless there's a rule like ""key is stop"", which there isn't. So I can move the ""key"", ""is"", and ""win"" blocks.

If I can break the ""key is win"" rule and create ""baba is win"", then I could just reach Baba (which is me) to win. Let's think about how to do that. The ""key"" block is at 7 right, 4 up. The ""is"" is at 8 right, 4 up, and ""win"" at 9 right, 4 up. To break this rule, I need to move one of these blocks. For example, moving the ""win"" block away would break the rule.

Alternatively, create a new rule ""baba is win"" by placing the ""baba"" text block (which is at 1 left, 2 down) next to ""is"" and ""win"". But the ""baba"" rule is at 1 left, 2 down, so maybe I can pick that up and move it to the right side where the other rules are. However, moving the ""baba"" block requires that I can move it. Since there's no rule saying ""baba is stop"", I should be able to move it.

So the plan is: move the ""baba"" rule to the right, place it next to ""is"" and ""win"" to form ""baba is win"". Then, since I'm Baba (you), I can just stay in place and win. But how to get there without hitting walls?

Alternatively, maybe I can first move towards the key, but the path is blocked by walls and the door. The door is at 7 right, 2 up, which is a rule ""door"". To pass through a door, I might need to change its property. If I can make ""door is stop"" into something else, like ""door is you"", then I could walk through it. But that might be complicated.

Alternatively, since the key is win, maybe I just need to touch the key. Once I have the key, does that make me win? The rule says ""key is win"", so if I can pick up the key, then perhaps I become win. But how do you pick up objects in Baba Is You? Usually, you push them or move them adjacent. So maybe I need to move the key to myself, but I'm not sure if that's possible.

Wait, in Baba Is You, you can move text blocks to create or break rules. So the key is an object, and ""key is win"" is a rule. To make myself win, I need to create a rule that says ""baba is win"". So the steps would be: move the ""baba"" text block (from its position at 1 left, 2 down) to the area where the other rules are, then place it next to ""is"" and ""win"" to form the new rule.

But to move the ""baba"" block, I have to navigate through the map. Let's see where Baba is located. The rule ""rule `baba` 1 step to the left and 2 steps down"" – that means the ""baba"" text block is located 1 step to the left and 2 steps down from wherever it's referenced. Wait, no. The way the rules are listed, each rule's position is relative to the player's position? Or is it an absolute position on the map?

This is a bit confusing. Let's try to parse the objects:

- wall 4 steps to the right and 4 step up: So there's a wall at (4r,4u) from wherever the starting point is.
- rule `key` 7r,4u: The ""key"" text block is at 7r,4u.
- Similarly, other rules and objects have their positions.

Assuming that the player (Baba) is at a certain position, but the observation doesn't explicitly state Baba's location. However, the ""rule `baba`"" is at 1 step left and 2 steps down. So perhaps Baba's position is such that the ""baba"" rule is located 1 left and 2 down from him. So if the ""baba"" rule is at 1 left, 2 down from Baba, that would mean Baba's position is 1 right, 2 up relative to the ""baba"" rule's position.

This is getting a bit too abstract. Maybe I should focus on moving the ""baba"" text block. To do that, I need to move nearby objects that are not stopped. The walls are stop, but the key, is, win, door, and other rules might be movable.

So, possible steps:

1. Move towards the ""baba"" rule at 1 left, 2 down from my current position. Wait, but where am I? The observation lists the objects but not my position. This is a problem. Without knowing where I am, it's hard to navigate.

Alternatively, perhaps the player's position is inferred from the rules. The ""rule `baba`"" is at 1 left, 2 down. So if that's a rule, then the player (Baba) must be at a position that satisfies the ""baba is you"" rule. Since ""baba is you"" is active, the player is Baba.

So, the ""baba"" text block is a rule that defines Baba's icon. To move that rule, I need to move the ""baba"" text block. Let's assume my current position is such that the ""baba"" rule is 1 left and 2 down from me. So to reach the ""baba"" rule, I need to move right and up.

But how do I know the direction? The positions are relative. For example, ""wall 4 steps to the right and 4 step up"" – if that's from my current position, then moving right 4 and up 4 would hit a wall. But I need to find my position relative to these objects.

This is tricky. Maybe a better approach is to look for movable objects. The key, is, win, door, and the baba rule are all text blocks that can be moved if they're not stopped. Since wall is stop, but these text blocks aren't part of a stop rule (except maybe the door if there's a rule ""door is stop"", but I don't see that), they should be movable.

The key is at 7r,4u. The ""is"" is at 8r,4u, and ""win"" at 9r,4u. So the ""key is win"" rule is formed by those three blocks. To break this rule, I can move any of them. For example, move the ""win"" block down to break the rule, then create a new rule ""baba is win"".

To move the ""win"" block, I need to navigate to its position at 9r,4u. But the path might be blocked by walls. Looking at the walls:

- At 4r,4u: wall
- 4r,3u: wall
- 4r,2u: wall
- 4r,1u: wall
- 4r: wall
- 4r,1d: wall
- And so on.

So the area to the right (from my current position) is blocked by walls at 4r, up to 4r,1d. The key is at 8r,1u, which is to the right of these walls. To get there, I might need to go around, but the map layout isn't clear.

Alternatively, focus on moving the ""baba"" rule. The ""baba"" rule is at 1 left, 2 down. If I can move that rule to the right, next to the ""is"" and ""win"" blocks, I can form ""baba is win"".

To move the ""baba"" rule, I need to be adjacent to it and move in a direction. Since the ""baba"" rule is at 1 left and 2 down from my position, I would need to move left and down to reach it, but that might hit a wall. Alternatively, if I'm supposed to be at a position where the ""baba"" rule is 1 left and 2 down, then my position is 1 right and 2 up relative to the ""baba"" rule.

Assuming that, then the ""baba"" rule is located at, say, position (x,y), and I am at (x+1, y+2). To move the ""baba"" rule, I need to be adjacent to it. So from my position (x+1, y+2), moving left would take me to (x, y+2), which is the ""baba"" rule's position. Then I can pick it up and move it.

But I need to confirm if that's possible. Since there's no rule saying ""baba is stop"", I should be able to move the ""baba"" text block.

Once I have the ""baba"" block, I need to move it to the area where the other rules are, which are on the right side at 7r,4u and onwards. So from my current position (assuming it's near the ""baba"" rule), moving right and up would get me towards the rules.

But the path might be blocked by walls. For example, at 4r,4u there's a wall. So to get from my position (x+1, y+2) to the rules at 7r,4u, I need to navigate around the walls. Maybe move down first to avoid the wall at 4r,4u.

Alternatively, the door at 6r,2u might be a way to pass through if I change its property. But that's more complex.

Another approach: Since the key is win, and the key is at 8r,1u, maybe I can move the key to myself. But how? In Baba Is You, you can push objects by moving into them from the side. So if I can get next to the key and push it towards me, but I need to be careful with the walls.

Looking at the key's position: 8r,1u. To get there, I might need to move right past the walls. The walls at 4r up to 4r,1d are blocking the straight path. So maybe go around the blocks. For example, move down to 4r, then right to 5r, but there's a wall at 5r,3u and others. This is getting complicated.

Alternatively, focus on creating the ""baba is win"" rule. Let's say I can move the ""baba"" rule to 7r,4u, then place ""is"" and ""win"" next to it. So the steps would be:

1. Move the ""baba"" rule from its current position (1 left, 2 down) to the right.
2. Find the ""is"" rule at 8r,4u and place the ""baba"" next to it, then add ""win"" to form ""baba is win"".

To do this, I need to navigate from my position to the ""baba"" rule, pick it up, and move it. Let's assume that moving left and down gets me to the ""baba"" rule. Once there, I can move it right.

But I'm not sure about the exact path. Maybe I should first try to move towards the ""baba"" rule. If I output ""left"" or ""down"", maybe that gets me closer.

Wait, the previous actions included ""left"" and ""right"", but the system kept defaulting to idle because the actions weren't valid. Maybe the direction needs to be specified correctly, considering the steps.

The observation lists objects with steps in directions like ""4 steps to the right and 4 step up"". So directions are absolute, not relative. But without knowing the player's position, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the player's position is at (0,0), and all other positions are relative to that. For example, a wall at 4r,4u would be at (4,4), key at (7,4), etc. If that's the case, then the player is somewhere not listed in the objects, possibly in a position that allows movement.

In that case, to reach the ""baba"" rule at ( -1, -2 ) relative to the player's position (assuming the rule is 1 step left and 2 down from the player), the player would need to move left and down. But if moving left or down hits a wall, that's a problem.

This is really confusing without a visual map. Maybe the best approach is to try moving in a direction that could lead to rearranging the text blocks. For example, moving right to get to the area where the key and other rules are, then moving the ""baba"" rule.

Alternatively, since the key is win, and the key is at (8,1), maybe I can move there and take the key. But how to get past the walls. The path to (8,1) is blocked by walls at (4,4), (4,3), etc. So perhaps go around the wall by moving down to (4,0), then right to (5,0), but I don't know if there's a wall there.

Looking at the objects:

- wall 4 steps to the right: So at (4,0).
- wall 4 steps to the right and 1 step down: (4,-1).
- wall 4 steps to the right and 2 steps down: (4,-2).

So the area below the main wall block is clear of walls. Maybe I can go down to (4,0), then right to (5,0), (6,0), etc., but there's a wall at (5,3) and others. This is getting too vague.

Another angle: The door at (6,2). If I can make the door passable, I could go through it. To do that, change ""door is [something stop]"" to ""door is you"" or remove the rule. But the door's rule is at (6,2), which is just the ""door"" text block. There's no ""is"" or ""stop"" after it, so maybe the door's behavior is default. In Baba Is You, a door without a rule is just a door, which is passable unless there's a rule saying ""door is stop"". Since there's no such rule here, maybe the door is passable. So if I can get to the door, I might be able to go through it to the other side where the key is.

But the key is at (8,1), and the door is at (6,2). So moving from (4,1) to (6,2) would require going through (5,1) which has a ball, and (6,1) which has a wall. Alternatively, go around via different paths.

This is really challenging without a visual. Maybe the intended solution is to rearrange the rules to make Baba the win condition. So focus on moving the ""baba"" rule to create ""baba is win"".

To do that, the steps would be:

1. Move the ""baba"" text block (at 1 left, 2 down from my position) to the right.
2. Place it next to the ""is"" and ""win"" blocks to form the new rule.

Assuming that the player is to the right and above the ""baba"" rule, moving left and down would reach the ""baba"" block. Once there, move it right towards the other rules.

But each move action needs to be a single direction. For example, to get to the ""baba"" rule, if it's one step left and two down, then moving left twice and down once. But the system might require specific step counts.

Alternatively, the answer is to move right repeatedly to reach the area with the rules and then rearrange them. But previous attempts with ""right"" didn't work, leading to idle. Maybe the direction needs to be adjusted","

Let's try to figure out what to do here. The active rules are key is win, wall is stop, and baba is you. The goal is usually to reach a win object, which is the key in this case. But since key is win, picking up the key would make me win, right?

Looking at the objects, there's a key located at 8 steps to the right and 1 step up. But there are walls blocking the path. Specifically, there's a wall 4 steps to the right and 1 step up, which is the same position as the key. Wait, no, the key is at 8 steps right and 1 up, while the wall is at 4 steps right and 1 up. So the key is further to the right. 

The player is controlled by Baba, which is ""you"" because of the rule baba is you. So I need to move Baba to the key. But the path is blocked by walls. The walls are stop, meaning they can't be moved through. However, maybe I can rearrange the rules to make the walls not stop or make the key something else.

Looking at the text blocks, there's a rule ""key is win"" at the top. To get the key, maybe I need to change that rule. But to do that, I have to move the text blocks around. The rule components are key, is, win. They're all in a row at 7,8,9 steps right and 4 up. To break that rule, I need to separate them. But since I'm Baba, I can move unless the object is stop. The rules themselves aren't marked as stop, so maybe I can move them.

Wait, the rule ""wall is stop"" is present. So any object labeled as wall is stop. The text blocks for the rules might be considered objects? For example, the rule `key` is an object that says ""key"". So if I can move the `is` or `win` texts away from the `key`, then the rule ""key is win"" would be broken. Then the key would no longer be a win, but maybe I can create a new rule like ""baba is win"" to make myself win.

So the steps would be: move the `is` and `win` text blocks away from the `key` text block to deactivate the ""key is win"" rule. Then, create a new rule ""baba is win"" by rearranging the texts. Once that's done, reaching Baba (me) would make me win.

But how to do that? Let's look at the positions. The key rule is at 7,8,9 steps right and 4 up. To break it, I need to move one of these texts. For example, move the `win` text block (9 steps right, 4 up) to another spot. Where can I place it? There's a spot at 10 steps right and 4 up, maybe? Or check if there's empty space. Alternatively, move the `is` block (8 steps right, 4 up) to a different position.

Once the ""key is win"" rule is broken, then create ""baba is win"". The `baba` text block is at 1 step left and 2 steps down. The `is` is at 2 steps down, and `you` is at 1 step right and 2 steps down. So to make ""baba is win"", I need to take the `win` text block (after moving it) and place it next to `baba` and `is`.

So first, move the `win` block from 9 steps right,4 up to somewhere else. Maybe move it down to where the `you` rule is, but that area has a wall. Alternatively, move it to a spot near the bottom. Let's see, the `baba` rule is at 1 left, 2 down. If I can move the `win` block there, then combine with `baba` and `is` to make ""baba is win"".

But how to move the `win` block? Since I'm Baba, I can move objects that aren't stop. The `win` text block isn't stop, so I can pick it up and move it. The action would be to move right towards the `win` block, then down or left to place it near `baba` and `is`.

Looking at the current positions: the `win` block is at 9 right,4 up. The `baba` rule is at 1 left, 2 down. So the distance is quite big. Maybe first, navigate to the `win` block. To get there from the player's position (assuming the player is at the starting point, which isn't specified, but based on the objects, maybe near the lower part), moving right multiple times and up.

But the path might be blocked. For example, at 4 steps right and 1 step up is a wall. So to reach the `win` block at 9 right,4 up, I need to go right 5 times, up 3 times. But along the way, there are walls at 4 right,1 up; 4 right,2 up; etc. So perhaps I need to find a path around the walls. Alternatively, move the walls by changing their rules.

Wait, the rule ""wall is stop"" is active. If I can change that rule to something else, like ""wall is push"" or remove it, then the walls might become movable. But to do that, I need to manipulate the text blocks. For example, break the ""wall is stop"" rule by moving the `stop` text block away.

The ""wall is stop"" rule is composed of `wall` at 1 left,3 up; `is` at 3 up; `stop` at 1 right,3 up. So to break this rule, move one of these texts. Let's say move the `stop` block to another position. Then the rule ""wall is stop"" is deactivated, so walls are no longer stop. That would allow me to move through them or push them.

Once walls are not stop, I can navigate around them. Then proceed to move the `win` block to create the new rule.

But this seems complicated. Let's break it down step by step.

1. Break the ""key is win"" rule by moving either `key`, `is`, or `win` away.
2. Break the ""wall is stop"" rule to make walls passable.
3. Create a new rule ""baba is win"".

Starting with step 1: Move the `win` block from 9 right,4 up to a new position. Suppose I move it down to 9 right,3 up. But that spot is occupied by a wall at 4 right,3 up. Not helpful. Maybe move it to the left. For example, to 8 right,4 up, but that's where the `is` block is. Can't place there. Alternatively, move it to 10 right,4 up if there's space. But I don't see any objects beyond 9 right in the current map. Maybe the map is limited, so need to find another spot.

Alternatively, break the ""key is win"" by moving the `is` block. The `is` is at 8 right,4 up. Move it down to 8 right,3 up. But that spot is a wall. Can't place there. Move it to 8 right,5 up? Not sure if that's possible. The observation doesn't mention objects beyond certain points, so maybe the map edges are walls.

This is getting tricky. Maybe a better approach is to first deal with the ""wall is stop"" rule. If I can make walls not stop, then I can move through them or push them out of the way.

The ""wall is stop"" rule is at 1 left,3 up (wall), 3 up (is), 1 right,3 up (stop). To break this, move the `stop` block. Suppose I move it to 2 right,3 up. Then the rule is broken, and walls are no longer stop. Now, I can move through walls or push them.

Once walls are passable, I can navigate to the `win` block. From the player's position (assuming they start at the lower part, like near the `baba` rule), move right past the walls since they're no longer stop. Then go up to reach the `win` block.

Once I have the `win` block, move it next to `baba` and `is` to create ""baba is win"". Then, touching Baba (me) would make me win.

So the steps would be:

1. Move the `stop` block from 1 right,3 up to a new position, breaking ""wall is stop"".
2. Navigate through the now-passable walls to reach the `win` block.
3. Move the `win` block to be adjacent to `baba` and `is`, forming ""baba is win"".
4. Then, move towards the new ""win"" condition, which is Baba himself.

But how to execute these steps with valid actions?

First, to move the `stop` block. The `stop` rule is at 1 step right and 3 step up. To move it, I need to be adjacent to it and move in a direction. The player's position isn't given, but based on the objects, perhaps the player is at the lower part, like near the `baba` rule at 1 left,2 down. So to reach the `stop` block at 1 right,3 up, the player would need to move right twice, up once. But along the way, at 4 right,1 up there's a wall. But if walls are now passable (after step 1), then moving through them is allowed.

Wait, but initially, walls are stop, so the player can't move through them. So to get to the `stop` block, the player would have to move around the walls. Let's assume the player starts at position (0,0) or similar. Without the exact starting position, it's hard, but based on the objects, maybe the player is near the `baba` rule at 1 left,2 down.

From there, to reach the `stop` block at 1 right,3 up:

- Move right once to 0 right,2 down (but that's the `baba` rule's position).
- Then move up to 0 right,1 down (but there's a wall at 4 right,1 step up, which is 4 right,1 up from the origin? Not sure. Maybe coordinates are relative.

This is getting confusing without knowing the player's exact position. But given that the previous actions were left and right, maybe the player is moving horizontally towards the rules.

Alternatively, focus on moving the `stop` block first. Since the `stop` block is at 1 right,3 up, if I can move it left or right. For example, move it to 2 right,3 up by pressing right twice while holding it. But how to pick it up? The player (Baba) is you, and since the rules haven't been changed yet, you can move objects that are not stop. The `stop` block itself is part of the rule ""wall is stop"", but the text blocks like `stop` are objects. Since walls are stop, but the text blocks like `stop` might not be walls. So maybe `stop` can be moved.

So action sequence:

1. Move right to reach the `stop` block at 1 right,3 up.
2. Move the `stop` block to a new position, say 2 right,3 up, by pressing right while carrying it.
3. This breaks the ""wall is stop"" rule, making walls passable.
4. Now, navigate through the walls (which are no longer stop) to reach the `key` and `win` blocks.
5. Move the `win` block to create ""baba is win"".

But the exact sequence of directions is needed. Let's assume the player is near the bottom. To reach the `stop` block at 1 right,3 up:

- From the starting position (perhaps at 4 right,2 down based on the walls), move left to 3 right,2 down. Then up to 3 right,1 down (wall, but now passable), up to 3 right,0 down. But this is guesswork.

Alternatively, perhaps the player is at the position of the `baba` rule, which is 1 left,2 down. So to get to the `stop` block at 1 right,3 up:

- Move right twice (to 0,2 down → 1,2 down (baba's position) → 2,2 down).
- Then up three times to reach 2,5 down. But this is unclear.

This is too ambiguous without the exact player position. Maybe a simpler approach: since the previous actions were left and right, perhaps the player is oscillating between positions. The key is to find a way to interact with the text blocks to change the rules.

Another angle: the key is win, but to pick up the key, I need to be adjacent to it. The key is at 8 right,1 up. The path is blocked by walls at 4 right,1 up, etc. If I can move the walls by changing their rules, then the path is clear.

But to change the wall rule, need to break ""wall is stop"" as before.

Once walls are passable, move right past them to reach the key. Then pick up the key. Since key is win, picking it up would make me win. But how to pick up the key? In Baba Is You, you can push objects if they are not stop. If walls are no longer stop, then maybe the key can be moved.

So steps:

1. Break ""wall is stop"" by moving the `stop` block.
2. Now, walls are passable.
3. Navigate to the key at 8 right,1 up, moving around the now-passable walls.
4. Pick up the key and bring it to a win condition (which is the key itself, so just carry it).

But the active rule is key is win, so carrying the key would make me win. So the action would be to move towards the key, pick it up, and maybe stand on it or carry it.

But the problem is the path. If walls are passable, then I can move through them. For example, from the `baba` rule at 1 left,2 down, move right past the walls at 4 right,2 down, etc., but that seems far.

Alternatively, after breaking ""wall is stop"", move the walls themselves. Since they're no longer stop, can I push them? If yes, then move the walls out of the way to access the key.

But this requires knowing the exact movement capabilities.

Given the confusion in player position and map layout, perhaps the immediate action is to try to move the `stop` block to break the ""wall is stop"" rule. The `stop` block is at 1 right,3 up. To reach it, move right and up. For example:

- Move right once to be adjacent to the `stop` block.
- Then, move the `stop` block to the right or left.

But the previous actions were left and right, so maybe the player is near the `baba` rule. Let's assume the player is at 1 left,2 down (the position of the `baba` text block). To get to the `stop` block at 1 right,3 up:

- Move right twice (to 0,2 down → 1,2 down (baba's position) → 2,2 down).
- Then move up three times to reach 2,5 down (assuming up increases the y-coordinate). But this might go off the map.

Alternatively, move up from the `baba` position (1 left,2 down) to 1 left,1 down (wall), but since walls are now passable after breaking the rule, move through it. But this requires changing the rule first.

This is too complicated without knowing the exact positions. Given the time constraints, perhaps the best immediate action is to move right towards the `win` block to try to interact with it, or move the `win` block to create a new rule.

Alternatively, since the key is win, and it's located at 8 right,1 up, maybe the solution is to simply move right until reaching the key, assuming the path is clear. But the path is blocked by walls. So the only way is to make the walls passable by changing the rule.

Thus, the priority is to break ""wall is stop"" by moving the `stop` block. The `stop` block is at 1 right,3 up. To move it, the player needs to be adjacent to it and move in a direction. Suppose the player is to the left of the `stop` block. Moving right twice would get them next to it. Then, pressing right again would move the `stop` block to the right.

So actions: right, right, right (to reach the `stop` block), then right again to move it. But the exact sequence depends on the player's current position.

Assuming the player is at the `baba` rule's position (1 left,2 down), moving right twice gets to 2 right,2 down. Then up once to 2 right,3 down. Wait, the `stop` block is at 1 right,3 up, which might be coordinates (x=1, y=3). So from (1 left,2 down) which is (-1, -2), moving right to (0, -2), then (1, -2), then up to (1, -1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3). That's seven moves up. But this is speculative.

Alternatively, the coordinates might be such that moving up increases the y-coordinate. So the `stop` block is at x=1, y=3. The player is at x=-1, y=-2. To get there, move right twice (x=1) and up five times (y=3). But that's a lot of moves, and the AI might not have enough steps.

Given the previous failed actions, perhaps the immediate action is to try to move the `stop` block. So the chosen action is to move right to get closer to it.

Let's try to figure out the solution here. The goal is usually to reach the ""win"" object, which is currently the key. The active rules are ""key is win"", ""wall is stop"", and ""baba is you"". That means whenever I move into a key, it becomes a win condition, so touching it should work. But there are walls blocking the path.

Looking at the map, I'm assuming I'm controlled as Baba since ""baba is you"". Let me check the objects again. The key is at 7 steps right and 1 step up. There's a wall directly below it at 4 steps right and 1 step up. So to get to the key, I need to move down past that wall. But wait, the wall is a stop, meaning I can't pass through it. Unless I can change the rules.

The available text blocks are the rules: key, is, win, wall, stop, door. Maybe I can rearrange them to create a new rule. For example, if I can make ""stop"" be something else, or change ""wall"" to not be stop. Alternatively, maybe make myself (Baba) have a property that overrides stop.

Looking at the objects, there's a rule ""you"" at 2 steps down. The rule is formed by ""baba is you"". If I can move the ""baba"", ""is"", and ""you"" text blocks to create a new rule, like ""baba is stop"", then maybe I can push through walls. Or maybe ""you is stop"" to make myself stop, which would be bad. Wait, no. The goal is to reach the key, which is win. Alternatively, maybe change ""win"" to be Baba, so touching anything becomes a win.

Another approach: the door is at 6 steps right and 2 steps up. If I can open the door by changing its rule, but I don't see a ""door is open"" rule. The current rules don't mention door except as a rule block. Maybe moving the ""key"" rule to make door win? Not sure.

Wait, the active rules are ""key is win"", so touching the key makes it a win. So the key's position is the target. The problem is getting past the walls. The wall at 4 right, 1 up is directly below the key. So I need to move down from the key's position, but there's a wall. Unless I can make that wall not a stop.

To do that, I need to modify the ""wall is stop"" rule. The ""wall"" rule is at 2 steps left and 3 step up. If I can move the ""wall"" text block and recombine it with ""is"" and something else, maybe change it to ""wall is not stop"". But how?

Alternatively, create a new rule that overrides ""wall is stop"". For example, if I can make ""baba is stop"", then I would stop on walls, which is bad. But if I make ""baba is push"" or something, but there's no ""push"" rule here. The available property words are key, is, win, wall, stop, door.

Looking at the text blocks on the map: there's a ""door"" rule at 6 steps right and 2 steps up. Maybe combining door with another property. But not sure.

Wait, the ""rule `door` 7 steps to the right and 2 step up"" – that's a text block that says ""door"". To make a rule, I need a subject, ""is"", and a property. So if I can move the ""door"" text block next to ""is"" and another property, like ""key"", then ""door is key"" would make door act like key. But the goal is to reach the key, which is already win. Maybe not helpful.

Another angle: the ""ball"" is at 5 right and 3 up. Not sure if that's relevant. The ""stop"" rule is at 3 step up. If I can move that ""stop"" rule to a different subject, like ""ball is stop"", then the ball would block movement. But not sure if that helps.

Wait, the key is win, so if I can reach the key, the level is solved. The problem is the wall blocking the path. Since walls are stop, I can't move through them. So I need to find a way to remove the stop property from the wall or make myself able to pass through.

To remove the stop property from the wall, I need to change the ""wall is stop"" rule. The ""wall"" text block is at 2 left and 3 up, ""is"" is at 1 left and 3 up, ""stop"" is at 3 step up. So if I can rearrange these three to form a different rule, like ""wall is key"", then walls would act as keys, which might be passable. But how?

Alternatively, create a new rule that says ""baba can move through walls"". Since ""baba is you"", maybe create ""baba is not stop"". To do that, I need to move the ""baba"" rule, ""is"", and ""not stop"". But ""not"" isn't a listed property here. The properties are key, is, win, wall, stop, door. So maybe can't use ""not"".

Wait, the available text blocks include ""is"" and ""you"". The ""you"" is at 2 steps down. The ""baba"" rule is at 2 left and 2 steps down. So if I can move ""baba"", ""is"", and ""win"" to make ""baba is win"", then touching Baba would make it a win, but that's not necessary since the key is already win. Alternatively, ""baba is door"" to reach the door.

Alternatively, create a rule that makes ""stop"" a different property. For example, ""stop is key"", which would change the effect of stop, but I'm not sure.

Another idea: since the key is win, maybe I don't need to move through walls but instead find a way to make the walls not stop. If I can change the ""wall is stop"" rule to ""wall is key"", then walls would be keys, which when touched would make them win. But how to do that.

The ""wall"" text block is at 2 left and 3 up, ""is"" is at 1 left and 3 up, ""stop"" is at 3 step up. If I can move these three to form ""wall is key"", I would need to move the ""stop"" to where the key is. The ""key"" rule is at 6 right and 4 up. So moving the ""wall"", ""is"", and ""key"" together to form ""wall is key"". That would make walls act like keys, which are win. So then, walking over a wall would trigger the win condition.

To do that, I need to move the ""wall"" (2 left, 3 up), ""is"" (1 left, 3 up), and ""key"" (6 right, 4 up) into position. But the problem is movement. My current position isn't clear, but assuming I'm Baba at 2 left and 2 steps down, based on the ""rule `baba`"" position.

To move the ""wall"" text block from 2 left 3 up to where? Let's see. The ""key"" is at 6 right 4 up. So I need to move the ""wall"" text block to the position of ""key"", but that's far. Alternatively, find a nearby spot to form the new rule.

Alternatively, maybe rearrange the existing ""wall is stop"" rule. The ""wall"" is at 2 left 3 up, ""is"" at 1 left 3 up, ""stop"" at 3 step up. If I can move the ""stop"" to be after ""wall is"", making ""wall is stop"" into ""wall is key"" by replacing ""stop"" with ""key"". But how?

The ""key"" is at 6 right 4 up, which is quite far. Maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule (3 step up) to the position of the ""key"" rule (6 right 4 up), but that would require moving it diagonally or multiple steps. Since movement is step by direction, maybe move down from the ""stop"" rule to reach the key area.

Alternatively, use the existing ""door"" rule at 6 right 2 up. If I can make door win, but the active rule is key is win.

This is getting complicated. Let's think step by step.

Current active rules:
- key is win: touching key makes you win.
- wall is stop: touching wall stops you.
- baba is you: you are controlled as Baba.

Objects on the map:
- Key is at 7 right, 1 up.
- Wall below key at 4 right, 1 up.
- Door at 6 right, 2 up.
- Baba's rule is at 2 left, 2 down.

To reach the key, need to get from wherever I am to 7 right, 1 up. But there's a wall at 4 right, 1 up. So path is blocked.

Possible solutions:
1. Remove the wall's stop property by changing the rule.
2. Make yourself able to pass through walls.
3. Find a way to make the door the win condition.
4. Use the key's rule to create a new rule that bypasses the wall.

For solution 1: Change ""wall is stop"" to ""wall is key"". To do this, need to move the ""wall"", ""is"", and ""key"" text blocks together. The ""wall"" is at 2 left 3 up, ""is"" is at 1 left 3 up, ""key"" is at 6 right 4 up. So I need to move these three into adjacent positions to form ""wall is key"".

Assuming I can move the text blocks, I would need to navigate to the ""wall"" text block, then move it, then the ""is"", then the ""key"". But movement is step by direction, and can only move objects that are not stop. The ""stop"" rule is at 3 step up, which is a wall? No, the ""stop"" is a text block that defines walls as stop. So maybe the walls are objects, and the text blocks are separate.

Wait, the objects on the map include walls at specific positions, and the rules are separate text blocks. So to move a text block, it must not be defined as stop. The ""stop"" rule applies to walls, not to text blocks. So text blocks like ""key"", ""is"", etc., can be moved as long as they're not on a stop object.

So to move the ""wall"" text block (at 2 left 3 up), I need to check if that position is on a stop object. The wall at 4 right 3 up is a stop, but the ""wall"" text block is at 2 left 3 up, which might be on a different position. Assuming the text blocks are on their own tiles, not overlapping with walls, then they can be moved.

So the plan is: move the ""wall"" text block, ""is"" text block, and ""key"" text block to form ""wall is key"". This would make walls act as keys, allowing passage.

To do this, I need to navigate to the ""wall"" text block at 2 left 3 up, then move it, then the ""is"", then the ""key"". But how to do that in actions.

Alternatively, since the key is already win, maybe arrange a rule that makes Baba turn into the key. For example, ""baba is key"", which would make touching Baba make him a key, thus win. But to create that rule, need ""baba"", ""is"", ""key"" nearby.

The ""baba"" rule is at 2 left 2 down, ""is"" is at 1 left 2 down, ""key"" is at 6 right 4 up. So moving those together.

But movement is step by direction. Let's assume my current position is at the Baba object, which is at 2 left 2 down. To reach the ""baba"" text block, I need to move right and up. Then move the ""is"" and ""key"" next to it.

Alternatively, maybe the easiest way is to move the ""key is win"" rule to a different position, but that doesn't help.

Another angle: since the key is win, and it's at 7 right 1 up, maybe I can push a wall out of the way. But walls are stop, so I can't push them unless I have a push rule. There's no push rule here.

Alternatively, use the door. If I can make the door win, then reaching the door would win. But the active rule is key is win. To change that, need to move the ""key"" text block, ""is"" text block, and another property.

For example, move ""key"", ""is"", and ""door"" to make ""door is win"". Then touching the door would win. The door is at 6 right 2 up. So I need to move the ""key"" (6 right 4 up), ""is"" (8 right 4 up), and ""door"" (6 right 2 up) together.

But that requires navigating between these positions, which might be possible.

Alternatively, create a rule that says ""baba is door"", making you a door, which if door is win (if changed), then touching you would win. But this is getting too convoluted.

Let me try to outline the steps:

1. Identify the key's position (7 right, 1 up) and the blocking wall (4 right, 1 up).
2. To bypass the wall, change its rule from ""stop"" to something else, like ""key"".
3. To do that, move the ""wall"" text block, ""is"" text block, and ""key"" text block into adjacent positions to form ""wall is key"".
4. The ""wall"" text block is at 2 left 3 up, ""is"" at 1 left 3 up, ""key"" at 6 right 4 up.
5. Need to move these three. Start by moving towards the ""wall"" text block.
6. From Baba's position (2 left 2 down), move right and up to reach the ""wall"" text block.
7. Once there, move the ""wall"" text block to the right and up near the ""key"" text block.
8. Then place the ""is"" and ""key"" next to it to form ""wall is key"".

But each movement is a single step. This would require multiple actions: moving right, up, grabbing the wall text block, moving it, etc. However, the problem is that in each observation, the position of objects changes based on previous actions. The user provided multiple observations where the positions of the key and rules shift, indicating that moving the text blocks changes their positions.

In the latest observation, the key is at 7 right, 4 up, and the rules are shifting. It seems like the level is reorganizing based on previous moves. This makes it harder to plan, as the positions change each time an action is taken.

Given the time constraints and the need to provide a single action, perhaps the quickest way is to move towards the key, hoping that by reaching it, the level is solved. But the wall is in the way. Alternatively, try to move the ""stop"" rule away to allow passage.

Another possibility: since ""baba is you"", maybe create a rule that makes ""you"" not stop. For example, ""you is not stop"", but there's no ""not"" property. Alternatively, ""you is key"", making you a key, which is win. To do that, need to move ""you"", ""is"", and ""key"" together.

The ""you"" rule is at 1 step right and 2 steps down. The ""key"" is at 6 right 4 up. So moving from Baba's position (2 left 2 down) to the ""you"" rule (1 right 2 down), then move right to get ""is"" and ""key"" nearby.

But this is getting too complex. Considering the previous failed attempts, maybe the correct action is to move right towards the key, hoping that after several moves, the path is cleared or a rule change happens.

Alternatively, since the key is win, and it's to the right, repeatedly moving right might eventually reach it, especially if the walls are repositioned. But in the given observations, the walls are still in the way.

Given the latest observation, the key is at 7 right, 4 up, and the wall is at 4 right, 3 up. So to get to the key, need to go right multiple times, but there's a wall at 4 right, 3 up which is a stop. So moving down from the key's position (7 right, 1 up) is blocked by the wall at 4 right, 1 up.

Wait, in the current observation, the key is at 7 right, 1 up, and the wall below it is at 4 right, 1 up. So the path from the key down to 4 right, 1 up is blocked. But to get to the key from the starting position (assuming Baba is at 2 left, 2 down), need to move right and up.

The steps required would be:

From Baba's position (2 left, 2 down):

1. Move right 4 times to get to 4 right, 2 down.
2. Move up 1 step to 4 right, 1 up (wall is here, stop).
3. Can't move up further.

So stuck. Hence, need to change the rule.

Possible solution: Move the ""wall is stop"" rule to make walls not stop. To do that, gather the ""wall"", ""is"", and another property (like ""key"") to form ""wall is key"".

The ""wall"" text block is at 2 left, 3 up. ""is"" is at 1 left, 3 up. ""key"" is at 6 right, 4 up.

To move these together:

1. From Baba's position (2 left, 2 down), move right 4 steps to 6 right, 2 down.
2. Move up 2 steps to 6 right, 4 up (where the key is).
3. But the key is a text block; need to interact with it. Alternatively, move the ""key"" text block to near the ""wall"" and ""is"".

This is getting too involved. Given the time I've spent and the need to provide an action, I'll go with moving right towards the key, hoping that after several steps, the path is cleared or a rule change occurs.

Let's see. The goal is to get to the key, which is also set as win. But right now, the key is guarded by walls that are stop. So I need to figure out how to move past those walls.

Looking at the active rules: key is win, wall is stop, and baba is you. Since I'm Baba, I can move around unless there's a wall. But the walls are stop, meaning I can't push them or go through them. So the challenge is to either remove the stop property from the walls or find a way to make the walls not stop.

Wait, the rules are made of text blocks. Maybe I can rearrange them to change the rules. For example, if I can make wall not be stop, then the walls would be passable. Or maybe change the key to something else, but key is already win. Hmm.

Looking at the objects, there's a door at 6 steps right and 2 steps up. Maybe the door is blocking the path to the key. But how do I open it? There's no rule about door being open or anything. Unless I can create a rule that door is open, but I don't see the text blocks for that.

The key is at 7 steps right and 4 steps up. Wait, no, in the current observation, the key is at 6 steps to the right and 1 step up. Right, the map is changing each time I move. Earlier observations showed the key moving as I moved left or right, maybe because the entire setup shifts when I move? Or perhaps it's a different level layout. Not sure, but in the latest observation, the key is near me, but there are walls blocking the path.

There's a rule `baba` at 3 steps left and 2 steps down. Since baba is you, that's me. So I can move around that area. The plan is to get to the key, which is win. But the walls are stop. So maybe I need to move the 'stop' rule away from the walls.

Looking at the active rules: wall is stop. If I can move the 'stop' text block, then wall wouldn't be stop anymore. The 'stop' rule is at 1 step left and 3 step up. So if I can move that rule, perhaps by pushing it with another object (but nothing is pushable except non-stop objects). Wait, only objects not defined as stop or similar can be moved. Since baba is you, and you can move, but can I move text blocks? The rules say you can move objects or text that are not stop. So if the text blocks aren't stop, I can move them. Let's check.

The 'stop' rule is part of the wall is stop rule. But once the rule is removed, wall wouldn't be stop. So maybe the approach is to move the 'stop' text block to another position, effectively removing the wall is stop rule.

Alternatively, create a new rule that makes Baba have the stop property, but that would be bad because then I can't move. Not helpful.

Another idea: The key is win, so if I can reach the key, I win. But the walls are in the way. Maybe I can move the walls by changing their properties. If I can make wall not stop, then I can pass through them. To do that, I need to remove the 'stop' rule associated with wall.

The current rules are:
- key is win
- wall is stop
- baba is you

The 'stop' rule is at 1 step left and 3 step up. So if I can move that 'stop' text block away, then the wall is stop rule would be broken. Then walls would just be walls, not stop, allowing me to walk through them.

Looking at the objects near the 'stop' rule: there's a wall at 2 steps right and 3 step up. Maybe I can push the 'stop' rule past that wall? Wait, can I push text blocks? The rules say you can move objects or text that are not stop. The 'stop' rule itself is a text block. Is the 'stop' rule considered stop? Because the rule is 'wall is stop', so the 'stop' property is assigned to wall. The 'stop' text block itself isn't necessarily stop unless it's part of a rule. So maybe I can move the 'stop' text block.

So the plan is: move the 'stop' rule (located at 1 step left and 3 step up) to another location, perhaps by moving it right or left past the walls. But how do I navigate to that position?

In the current observation, my position (Baba) is at 3 steps to the left and 2 steps down relative to the map's reference point. Because the rule `baba` is at 3 step to the left and 2 steps down. So to reach the 'stop' rule at 1 step left and 3 step up, I need to move north and east.

Let me visualize the map:

Baba is at 3 left, 2 down.

The 'stop' rule is at 1 left, 3 up. So from Baba's position, to get there, I need to move 2 steps right (since 1 left from reference is 3 left from Baba) and 5 steps up. But there might be walls blocking the path.

Alternatively, maybe there's a path around. Let's check the nearby objects.

Looking at the objects around Baba's position (3 left, 2 down):

- There's a wall at 2 steps right and 3 step up (wall 2 steps right and 3 step up).
- The 'stop' rule is at 1 step left and 3 step up.
- The 'door' rule is at 5 steps right and 2 step up.
- The key is at 6 steps right and 1 step up.

Hmm. So to reach the 'stop' rule, I need to go north. But there's a wall at 2 steps right and 3 step up. If I can move that wall by changing its rule, but that's complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps move the 'stop' text block manually. Since 'stop' is a text block, and if it's not defined as stop, I can move it. The 'stop' text block's position is 1 step left and 3 step up. To move it, I need to be adjacent to it and move in a direction.

Baba's current position is 3 step left and 2 steps down. To reach the 'stop' rule at 1 left, 3 up, I need to move:

From (3L, 2D) to (1L, 3U):

Differences: +2 steps right (since 3L to 1L is 2R) and +5 steps up (2D to 3U is 5U). But the path might be blocked.

Looking at the objects between Baba and the 'stop' rule:

- There's a wall at 2 steps right and 3 step up. So if I move right twice and up five times, I'd hit that wall at 2R, 3U. Can't go through it because it's a stop.

Alternative route: Maybe move right once, then up, then right, then up, etc., avoiding the wall. But the wall is directly in the path if going straight up and right.

Alternatively, move up first, then right. Let's see:

Starting at 3L, 2D.

Move up to 3L,1D.

Then up to 3L,0D.

Then up to 3L,1U.

Then right to 2L,1U.

Then up to 2L,2U.

But there's a wall at 2R and 3U. Wait, the wall is at 2 steps right and 3 step up from the reference point. So from Baba's position (3L, 2D), moving to 2L,2U would be:

Reference point's coordinates might be different. This is getting confusing. Maybe I need to map out the coordinates.

Assuming the reference point is the top-left corner, but Baba's position is given relative to that. Let's assume the map is a grid where each step moves in the specified direction.

Alternatively, perhaps the coordinates are relative to Baba's position. But the observations list objects relative to the map's reference point, which might be the top-left corner.

This is getting complicated. Maybe the best approach is to move towards the 'stop' rule, avoiding walls by moving around them. Once I reach the 'stop' text block, I can move it to a different location, removing the wall is stop rule.

Alternatively, create a new rule that makes wall not stop. For example, if I can move the 'is' and 'stop' text blocks apart. The current wall is stop rule is made by 'wall' is 'stop', which are three text blocks: 'wall', 'is', 'stop' arranged horizontally or vertically.

In the current observation, the 'wall' rule is at 3 step up, composed of 'wall' 2 step to the left and 3 step up, 'is' 2 step to the left and 3 step up, and 'stop' 1 step to the left and 3 step up. So these three text blocks form the rule ""wall is stop"".

To break this rule, I need to separate them. For example, move the 'stop' text block away from the 'is' and 'wall' text blocks. Once they're not adjacent, the rule is broken.

So the plan is: move the 'stop' text block (at 1 step left and 3 step up) to a different position, say, move it down or right, so that it's no longer connected to 'wall' and 'is'.

But how to do that? The 'stop' text block is at 1L,3U. To move it, I need to be adjacent to it and move in a direction.

Baba's current position is at rule `baba` 3 step to the left and 2 steps down. So that's coordinates: Baba is at (3L, 2D). The 'stop' rule is at (1L, 3U). The distance between them is 2 steps right and 5 steps up.

But there's a wall at 2R,3U. So moving directly there is blocked.

Alternative path: Move Baba to the 'stop' rule's location by going around the wall.

From (3L,2D):

1. Move right once to (2L,2D).
2. Move up to (2L,1D).
3. Move up to (2L,0D).
4. Move up to (2L,1U).
5. Move right to (1L,1U).
6. Move up to (1L,2U).
7. Move up to (1L,3U), which is where the 'stop' rule is.

But along the way, check if there are obstacles.

Step 1: Right to (2L,2D). Is there a wall there? Looking at objects, wall is at 4 steps right and various positions, but not at 2L,2D. So probably clear.

Step 2: Up to (2L,1D). No wall mentioned here.

Step 3: Up to (2L,0D). Still no wall.

Step 4: Up to (2L,1U). There's a wall at 2 steps right and 1 step up (wall 2 steps right and 1 step up). So can't move into that wall. Blocked.

Uh-oh, that's a problem. So step 4 is blocked by a wall at 2R,1U. So that path is impossible.

Alternative route: Instead of going up from 2L,2D to 2L,1U, maybe go right again.

From (2L,2D):

1. Move right to (1L,2D).
2. Move up to (1L,1D).
3. Move up to (1L,0D).
4. Move up to (1L,1U).
5. Move up to (1L,2U).
6. Move up to (1L,3U) which is the 'stop' rule.

Check for walls along this path.

From (1L,2D) to (1L,1D): clear.

(1L,1D) to (1L,0D): clear.

(1L,0D) to (1L,1U): clear.

(1L,1U) to (1L,2U): clear.

(1L,2U) to (1L,3U): arrives at 'stop' rule.

But is there a wall at 1L,3U? The 'stop' rule is there, but it's a text block, not a wall. So moving there should be possible if it's not stop.

Since 'stop' is a property of wall, not the text block itself, the 'stop' text block can be moved. So this path seems possible.

Once at (1L,3U), which is the 'stop' text block's location, I can move it. For example, move it down to (1L,2U), separating it from the 'wall' and 'is' text blocks.

But the 'is' text block is at 2L,3U (since the 'wall is stop' rule has 'is' at 2L,3U). So moving 'stop' to 1L,3U is already where it is. Wait, no, the 'stop' is at 1L,3U, 'is' is at 2L,3U, and 'wall' is at 3L,3U. So the three text blocks are adjacent horizontally: wall-is-stop.

To break the rule, I need to separate them. So move the 'stop' text block down to 1L,2U. Then the rule would be wall-is-stop at 3L,3U; 2L,3U; 1L,3U (original positions), but if I move 'stop' to 1L,2U, then they're no longer adjacent.

So steps:

From (1L,3U) (which is the 'stop' text block), move down to (1L,2U).

This would break the wall is stop rule, making walls not stop anymore. Then I can walk through the walls.

Once that's done, I can path to the key at 6R,1U.

But how to execute this? First, navigate to the 'stop' text block, then move it.

But to get to (1L,3U), the path I planned earlier should work: from Baba's position (3L,2D), move right to 2L,2D; up to 2L,1D; up to 2L,0D; up to 2L,1U; right to 1L,1U; up to 1L,2U; up to 1L,3U.

But wait, moving from 2L,1U to 1L,1U would require moving left, which is possible if there's no wall there.

Assuming there are no walls blocking that path, this should work.

Once at (1L,3U), move the 'stop' text block down to (1L,2U).

Now, the wall is stop rule is broken. Walls are no longer stop, so I can walk through them.

Then, navigate to the key at 6R,1U. The path would involve moving right past the walls, which are now passable.

So the sequence of actions would be:

1. Move right to 2L,2D.
2. Move up to 2L,1D.
3. Move up to 2L,0D.
4. Move up to 2L,1U.
5. Move left to 1L,1U.
6. Move up to 1L,2U.
7. Move up to 1L,3U (stop rule).
8. Move down to 1L,2U (moving the stop text block).
9. Now, walls are not stop. Move right past the walls to reach the key.

But the problem is, each action is a single step. The question is, what's the first action needed to start this process.

Looking at the current observation, the key is at 6R,1U, and I need to get there. But the immediate obstacle is the wall at 2R,3U which is blocking part of the path. However, by removing the stop rule, that wall becomes passable.

But to do that, I need to reach the 'stop' text block. The first step is to move right twice and up five times, but that's blocked by the wall at 2R,3U. So the alternative path is necessary.

The first action in that path is to move right from Baba's initial position (3L,2D) to 2L,2D. So the first action should be 'right'.

But wait, let's confirm the directions. If Baba is at 3 steps left and 2 steps down, moving right would decrease the left steps by 1. So from 3L to 2L, which is moving right.

Yes, the first action should be 'right' to start moving towards the 'stop' text block.

I need to figure out how to get past this level in Baba Is You. The active rules are key is win, wall is stop, and baba is you. My goal is usually to reach the key because key is win, but I might need to change that somehow.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key located at 5 steps to the right and 1 step up. But there's a wall at 1 step to the right and 1 step up. The wall is stop, so I can't go through it. Also, there's a rule door at 4 steps to the right and 2 steps up. Maybe the door is something I can interact with once I have the key? 

Baba is you, so I can move around as Baba. The problem is the walls blocking the path to the key. Since wall is stop, I need to find a way to make the walls not stop me. How? In Baba Is You, you can create new rules by rearranging text blocks. Let me check the objects again. 

There's a rule `key` at 4 right, 4 up; `is` at 5 right, 4 up; and `win` at 6 right, 4 up. If I can move these text blocks to form a new rule, like making Baba able to go through walls. For example, if I can create a rule like ""baba is not stop"" or ""wall is not stop"". But how do I get those text blocks?

The `you` rule is at 2 steps left and 2 steps down, near the rule `baba`, `is`, and `you`. If I can move the `baba` text block to where I am, then combine it with `is` and another property. Wait, where is Baba located? The rule `baba` is at 4 steps left and 2 steps down, right? So Baba is at that position. 

So maybe I need to get to the `baba` text block and move it. But to move anything, it can't be defined as stop. The wall is stop, but the text blocks like `key`, `is`, `win`, `wall`, `stop`, `door`—those are movable unless they're part of an active rule that makes them stop. Let's see: the active rules are key is win, wall is stop, and baba is you. So the text blocks for key, is, win, wall, stop, door are all movable because they're not part of a rule that makes them stop. Except the ones that are part of the active rules. Wait, the active rules are formed by the text blocks in the format [Subject] IS [Property]. So the `key`, `is`, `win` are part of the ""key is win"" rule. Similarly for the others. But the individual text blocks can still be moved as long as they're not in a rule that makes them stop. 

So the plan is: move the `baba` text block to a position where I can create a new rule that changes either Baba's properties or the wall's properties. For example, if I can make ""baba is stop"", then I would be a stop and can't move. That's bad. Alternatively, make ""wall is not stop"" so I can walk through walls. Or make ""baba is win"" so touching anything becomes a win condition. 

Looking at the current setup, the `baba` text block is at 4 steps left and 2 steps down. The player (Baba) is presumably at that position. The `is` text block is at 3 steps left and 2 steps down. The `you` text block is at 2 steps left and 2 steps down. So if I can move the `you` to where I am (baba), then combine with `is` and another property. Wait, but the active rule is ""baba is you"", so if I move the `you` to another subject, that could change the rule. 

Alternatively, to create ""baba is not stop"", I need the `not` text block, but I don't see that in the current objects. Hmm. Let me check the objects again. The objects listed are walls, key, ball, door, and the rules: key, is, win, wall, stop, door. No `not` rule. So maybe that's not an option. 

Another approach: since the key is win, if I can reach the key, I win. But the path is blocked by walls. The walls are at 1 right and 1 up, 2 right and 2 up, etc. If I can make the walls passable, like changing their rule to ""wall is not stop"". To do that, I need the `wall` text block and the `is` and `not stop` text blocks. But I don't have `not` here. 

Wait, maybe I can use the existing rules. The active rule is ""wall is stop"". If I can break that rule by moving the `wall` or `stop` text blocks. For example, if I move the `stop` text block away from the `wall` rule, then the rule ""wall is stop"" would become invalid. But the `stop` is currently at 2 steps left and 3 step up. The ""wall is stop"" rule is formed by the `wall` text block at 4 step left and 3 step up, `is` at 3 step left and 3 step up, and `stop` at 2 step left and 3 step up. So if I can move the `stop` text block, then the ""wall is stop"" rule would be disconnected, making wall not stop. 

But to move the `stop` text block, I need to be able to move it. Since wall is stop, but the `stop` text block itself isn't part of a rule that makes it immovable. So maybe I can pick up the `stop` text block and move it away. Let's see where the `stop` is located: 2 steps left and 3 step up. I need to get to that position. 

But where is the player (Baba) located? The `baba` rule is at 4 step left and 2 steps down. So the player is at 4 left, 2 down. To get to the `stop` text block at 2 left, 3 up, I need to move left and up. Let's see the path. From 4 left, 2 down: moving left three steps would get to 1 left, 2 down. But there's a wall at 1 step to the right and 2 steps down (wait, the walls are at various positions; need to check the map again). 

Wait, the objects on the map include:

- wall 1 step to the right and 4 step up
- rule `key` 4 right, 4 up
- etc.

Wait, maybe the coordinates are a bit confusing. Let me try to visualize the grid. The player (Baba) is at the position of the rule `baba`, which is 4 steps left and 2 steps down. So if the grid is relative, maybe the player is at a certain point, and other objects are positioned relative to that. 

Alternatively, perhaps the coordinates are in steps from the player's position. For example, ""wall 4 steps to the right and 4 step up"" means there's a wall 4 steps to the right and 4 steps up from the player's current position. Similarly, the `baba` rule is 4 steps left and 2 steps down from the player. 

In that case, the player is at the origin (0,0), and other objects are positioned relative to that. So the wall at 4 right, 4 up is at (4,4). The `baba` rule is at (-4, -2). The `stop` rule is at (-2, 3). 

The player's current position is where the `baba` rule is located, which is (-4, -2). To get to the `stop` rule at (-2, 3), the player needs to move right (towards positive x) and up (towards positive y). The path would be: from (-4,-2), move right once to (-3,-2), then right again to (-2,-2), then up to (-2,-1), (-2,0), (-2,1), (-2,2), (-2,3). But along the way, are there any walls or other obstacles?

Looking at the objects, there's a wall at (1,4), but that's far away. The walls near the player are at (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (4,0), (4,-1), and (4,-2). Also, a wall at (-2,2) and (-2,-2). Wait, the wall at (-2,-2) is two steps right and two steps down from the player's original position? Hmm, maybe the coordinates are a bit different. 

Alternatively, perhaps the map is laid out with the player starting at a certain point, and other objects placed in specific positions relative to that. This can get complicated, but the key is to find a way to move the `stop` text block away to break the ""wall is stop"" rule. 

So the plan is: move the `stop` text block from its current position (let's say it's at position S) to a different location, thereby breaking the ""wall is stop"" rule. Once wall is no longer stop, the walls become passable. Then, the player can move through the walls to reach the key. 

To move the `stop` text block, the player needs to be adjacent to it and move it in a direction. The `stop` text block is at a position that's 2 steps left and 3 steps up from the player's starting position (since the player is at 4 steps left and 2 steps down, which would be (-4,-2), and the `stop` is at 2 steps left and 3 steps up, which is (-6,1)? Maybe the coordinate system is relative. This is getting a bit confusing. 

Alternatively, perhaps the best approach is to move the `is` text block that's part of the ""wall is stop"" rule. If I can disconnect the `is` from `wall` and `stop`, that rule would be broken. The ""wall is stop"" rule is composed of the `wall` text block, `is`, and `stop`. If I can move the `is` away, the rule becomes invalid. 

The `is` text block in the ""wall is stop"" rule is at 1 step to the left and 3 step up (from the player's position?). Or maybe the positions are absolute. This is tricky without seeing the actual grid layout. 

Another possibility: since the key is win, maybe the real goal is to reach the key, but the walls are in the way. However, if I can create a rule that makes Baba able to move over walls, like ""baba is push"" or something. But I don't have a `push` text block. 

Wait, the available text blocks are key, is, win, wall, stop, door. So I can create rules like ""baba is key"", but that wouldn't help. Or ""baba is win"", which would make touching anything a win, but there's a ball nearby. 

Alternatively, ""baba is door"", but that also doesn't make sense. 

Wait, the ball is at 2 steps right and 3 step up. If I can make ""baba is ball"", then moving towards the ball would make me a ball, but the rules don't change that. 

Hmm. Let's think differently. The key is at 5 steps right and 1 step up. To get there, I need to move right and up, but there's a wall at 4 steps right and 1 step up. If I can turn that wall into something else, like ""wall is win"", then stepping on it would win the game. But how? 

Alternatively, create a rule ""you is win"", making the player (Baba) win when they touch win, which is the key. But I need to have the `you` text block somewhere. The `you` rule is at 2 steps left and 2 steps down. So if I can move the `you` to the key's position, then ""you is win"" would make touching the key win. 

But how to move the `you` text block. To do that, I need to be adjacent to it and move it. The `you` is at 2 steps left and 2 steps down from the player's starting position. So the player needs to move left twice and down twice to reach the `you` text block. 

Let me outline the steps:

1. Move from the player's starting position (baba's rule at 4 left, 2 down) to the `you` text block at 2 left, 2 down. That requires moving left twice and staying at the same y-level. But is there a wall in the way? The walls are at 4 right various ups and downs, but on the left side, there's a wall at 4 left and 2 down (player's position), and others? Not sure. 

Assuming there's a path, the player can move left twice to reach the `you` text block. Then, pick it up and move it to the key's position (5 right, 1 up). 

But this requires navigating around walls. Let's see: from the player's position (-4,-2), moving left to (-5,-2), (-6,-2), etc., but there's a wall at 4 steps right and 4 step up, which is probably far away. The walls near the player might be those listed in the objects. For example, wall 4 steps to the right and 4 step up is at (4,4), which is far from the player. The wall at 1 step to the right and 3 step up is at (1,3). 

So moving left from the player's position might not hit any walls immediately. Once the player reaches the `you` text block at (-6,-2) (assuming coordinates are relative), then they can move the `you` to the key's location at (5,1). 

Once the `you` is moved next to the key, creating the rule ""you is win"" (since the key is already a rule `key`), then touching the key would make the player win. 

Alternatively, moving the `you` to the key's position and combining with `is` and `win` to make ""you is win"". 

This seems like a possible path. 

So the steps would be:

- Move left twice to reach the `you` text block.
- Pick up `you` and move it to the key's location (5 right, 1 up).
- Place `you` next to `key` and `is` to form ""you is win"".
- Then, go to the key and touch it to win.

But how to move the `you` text block. Each move action would involve moving the player and then the text block if possible. 

Alternatively, after moving the `you` to the key, the rule becomes ""you is win"", so touching the key (which is win) would make the player win, since Baba is you. 

Yes, that makes sense. So the key is already defined as win, but if we make ""you is win"", then touching the key would trigger the win rule. Wait, no. The active rule is ""key is win"", meaning that the key is win. So touching the key would win the game regardless. But maybe the level is designed so that the key is in a place you can't reach, so you have to change the rule to make Baba able to move over walls. 

Wait, the initial problem is that the path to the key is blocked by walls that are stop. So unless you can make the walls not stop, you can't get past them. 

So perhaps creating a rule like ""wall is push"" or ""baba is push"" to move walls. But we don't have a `push` text block. 

Alternatively, create ""baba is door"", but the door is at 4 steps right and 2 steps up. Not sure. 

Another Idea: Since the key is win, maybe the solution is to reach the key despite the walls by changing the ""wall is stop"" rule. To do that, move the `stop` text block away. 

The `stop` text block is at 2 steps left and 3 steps up from the player's position. So moving right and down to get to it. Let's see:

From player's position (-4,-2):

- Move right once to (-3,-2)
- Right again to (-2,-2)
- Up to (-2,-1)
- Up to (-2,0)
- Up to (-2,1)
- Up to (-2,2)
- Up to (-2,3) which is where the `stop` text block is.

But along the way, are there walls? The walls are at 4 right various positions, but on the left side, there's a wall at (-2,-2) (4 steps right and 2 steps down from the original position? Not sure. This is getting too ambiguous without seeing the actual grid. 

Assuming there's a path, the player can move to the `stop` text block and move it. Once `stop` is moved, the ""wall is stop"" rule is broken, making walls passable. Then the player can walk through the walls to the key. 

So the steps would be:

1. Navigate to the `stop` text block at (-2,3).
2. Pick it up and move it to a different location, say, next to the `key` text block.
3. Now, walls are no longer stop, so the player can walk through them.
4. Move to the key at (5,1) and grab it, winning the level.

But how to move the `stop` text block. Each move action would involve moving the player towards it, then moving the text block in a direction. 

Alternatively, the player can move the `is` text block that's part of the ""wall is stop"" rule. If the `is` is moved, the rule is broken. 

The `is` in ""wall is stop"" is at 1 step left and 3 step up. So from the player's position (-4,-2), moving left to (-5,-2), (-6,-2), etc., but that's probably not the right direction. 

This is really tricky without seeing the exact layout. Given the previous failed attempts and the pattern, the correct action might be to keep moving right towards the key, hoping that eventually the walls become passable after rearranging rules. 

But based on the previous observations, after several right moves, the key moves further right each time, indicating that maybe the solution involves moving text blocks to change the rules dynamically. 

Wait, looking at the observations after each action, the","

Let's try to figure out what to do here. The active rules are ""key is win"", ""wall is stop"", and ""baba is you"". So, the goal is to get to the key, which is acting as the win condition. But the walls are stops, meaning I can't pass through them.

Looking at the objects on the map, Baba is me because of the ""baba is you"" rule. So I need to move Baba to the key. The key is located 5 steps to the right and 1 step up from where I think I am. But there's a wall at 4 steps to the right and 2 steps up, and another wall at 4 steps right and 1 step up. Also, there's a door at 5 steps right and 2 steps up. Wait, the door might be movable if I can change its properties.

The ball is at 2 steps right and 3 steps up. Not sure if that's useful yet. The rule blocks are scattered around. The ""key is win"" rule is at 4,7,8,9 steps right and 4 up. Maybe I need to move that rule to make the key a win, but it's already set as key is win. Wait, no—the active rule is ""key is win"", so touching the key should win the level. But the key is guarded by walls. 

Looking at the movement: I need to navigate from where Baba is (rule blocks at 4 steps left and 2 steps down) to the key. Let's map the path. From Baba's position (4 left, 2 down), I can move down to the wall, but that's a stop. Maybe move left? But there's a wall at 1 step right and 1 step down. Alternatively, move up towards the key. The key is at 5 steps right and 1 step up. So the path would be: move right, right, right, right, then up. But between Baba and the key, there are walls blocking the way. 

The wall at 4 steps right and 1 step up is directly below the key. So to get to the key, I need to remove that wall's stop property or move it. How? The ""wall is stop"" rule is active. If I can change that rule, I could make walls passable. The ""wall is stop"" rule is at 2 left and 3 up. To move that rule, I need to be adjacent to it and not hit a stop. Let me check where the ""wall is stop"" rule is. According to the objects, rule `stop` is at 2 step to the left and 3 step up. So that's to the left of the current position. 

Baba is at 4 step to the left and 2 steps down. So moving left from there would take me to the ""wall is stop"" rule's position? Wait, the rule `stop` is 2 steps to the left and 3 steps up from where? Let me parse the observation again. 

The objects list includes ""rule `stop` 2 step to the left and 3 step up"". Assuming that's relative to Baba's position? Or relative to some origin? This is a bit confusing. Maybe the coordinates are relative to Baba's position. For example, if Baba is at (0,0), then the wall at 4 steps right and 4 up would be at (4,4). The ""stop"" rule is at (-2, 3) if Baba is at (0,0). 

So Baba's position is at rule `baba` 4 step to the left and 2 steps down. Wait, the rule `baba` is at 1 step to the left and 2 steps down from the observation. Wait, the observation says: ""rule `baba` 1 step to the left and 2 steps down"". So if that's relative to Baba's position, then maybe Baba is at (1,2)? Or is the rule positioned relative to some other point? This is a bit unclear. 

Alternatively, perhaps all positions are relative to the player's (Baba's) position. So if the rule `baba` is 1 step to the left and 2 steps down, that means Baba is located at a position such that the `baba` rule is 1 step left and 2 down from him. So to get to the `baba` rule, Baba would have to move right and up. 

This is getting complicated. Let me try to visualize the grid. Let's assume Baba's position is at (0,0). Then:

- The `baba` rule is 1 step left (x=-1) and 2 steps down (y=-2).
- The `is` rule is 1 step left (x=-1) and 2 steps down (y=-2), same as `baba`.
- The `you` rule is 1 step right (x=1) and 2 steps down (y=-2).

So the three rules (baba, is, you) form the ""BABA IS YOU"" rule block at (-1, -2) and (1, -2).

The key is at 5 steps right (x=5) and 1 step up (y=1).

The walls are spread out: at (4,4), (1,3), (5,3), (4,2), (7,2), (4,1), (5,1), (4,0), (4,-1), and (4,-2).

The door is at (6,2).

The ball is at (3,3).

The ""key is win"" rules are at (4,4), (7,4), (8,4), (9,4).

The ""wall is stop"" rule is at (-2,3) (2 steps left and 3 up from Baba's position).

So the plan is: get to the key at (5,1). But the path is blocked by walls at (4,1) and possibly others. To get past the wall at (4,1), we need to either remove its 'stop' property or move it. 

The ""wall is stop"" rule is at (-2,3). If we can move that rule, we can change what 'wall' does. For example, if we make 'wall' not 'stop', then the walls would be passable. 

To move the 'stop' rule, we need to be adjacent to it and not hit a 'stop' object. The 'stop' rule is at (-2,3), which is 2 steps left and 3 steps up from Baba. So from Baba's position (0,0), moving left twice and up three times would reach the 'stop' rule. But the path there: moving left from (0,0) to (-1,0) is possible? Are there walls in between? Let's check. 

Looking at the walls: at (4,4), (1,3), (5,3), (4,2), etc. So from (0,0) moving left to (-1,0) – is there a wall there? The walls listed don't include (-1,0), so maybe it's passable. Then moving left again to (-2,0), but the 'stop' rule is at (-2,3). So first, move left twice to (-2,0), then up three times to reach (-2,3). 

But moving up from (-2,0) to (-2,1): is there a wall? The walls are at (4,4), (1,3), (5,3), (4,2), (7,2), (4,1), etc. So (-2,1) is clear. Then to (-2,2): check for walls. No walls listed there. Then to (-2,3): there's the 'stop' rule. So moving up to (-2,3) is possible. Once there, we can pick up the 'stop' rule and move it elsewhere to change the 'wall is stop' rule. 

Once we've moved the 'stop' rule, the walls would no longer be 'stop', allowing us to walk through them. Then we can path to the key. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a door at (6,2) which could be opened if we have a key. But the key is the win condition, so maybe opening the door isn't necessary. 

Another approach: since the key is the win condition, maybe we can grab the key directly if the path is clear. But the wall at (4,1) is directly below the key. So even if we move the 'stop' rule, removing the 'stop' property from walls would let us walk through them. 

So step-by-step plan:

1. Move from Baba's position (0,0) to the 'stop' rule at (-2,3).
   - Path: left, left, up, up, up.
   - Check for walls along the way. From (0,0) left to (-1,0) – no wall. Left again to (-2,0) – no wall. Up to (-2,1), (-2,2), (-2,3) – all clear.
2. Pick up the 'stop' rule and move it somewhere else to delete the 'wall is stop' rule.
   - For example, move it down to (-2,0), which is empty.
3. Now, walls are no longer 'stop', so we can walk through them.
4. Head towards the key at (5,1). Path: right, right, right, right, up, up.
   - From (0,0) to (5,0), then up to (5,1). The wall at (4,1) is now passable.
5. Touch the key at (5,1), which is the 'win' condition because 'key is win'.

Alternatively, maybe there's a nearer rule to manipulate. For example, the 'door' rule at (6,2). If we can make the door passable or a you, but that might not help. 

Another thing to consider: the ball at (3,3). If we can make the ball 'you', then maybe we can control it, but that's probably more complicated. 

So the main plan is to remove the 'wall is stop' rule by moving the 'stop' text block, then navigate to the key. 

Now, the immediate action needed is to move towards the 'stop' rule. From the current observation, after several defaults to idle, the last successful action was 'right'. But now, based on the latest observation, where are we?

Wait, in the latest observation before the current one, the user provided the observation where the key is at 5 steps right and 1 up, and the 'stop' rule is at 2 left and 3 up. Assuming Baba is at (0,0), the 'stop' rule is at (-2,3). So to get there, the first move should be 'left' to move towards it. 

But in previous steps, the assistant kept getting invalid actions. Maybe the coordinate system is different. Let me re-express the positions assuming Baba is at (0,0):

- rule `baba` is 1 step left (x=-1) and 2 steps down (y=-2).
- rule `is` is 1 step left (x=-1) and 2 steps down (y=-2).
- rule `you` is 1 step right (x=1) and 2 steps down (y=-2).

So the ""BABA IS YOU"" is at (-1,-2) and (1,-2).

The key is at (5,1).

The 'stop' rule is at (-2,3).

So to reach (-2,3), from (0,0):

- Move left once to (-1,0)
- Move left again to (-2,0)
- Move up three times: (-2,1), (-2,2), (-2,3)

Each move should be valid if there are no walls in between. Checking the walls listed:

- Walls at (4,4), (1,3), (5,3), (4,2), (7,2), (4,1), (5,1), (4,0), (4,-1), (4,-2). None of these are in the path from (0,0) to (-2,3), so movement should be possible.

Therefore, the first action should be 'left' to start moving towards the 'stop' rule.

Let's try to figure this out. The goal is usually to get to the ""win"" object, which right now is the key. Because of the rule ""key is win"", so grabbing the key Should make me win. But the key is behind walls that are stops. So I need to move around them.

First, where am I? Looking at the objects, there's a ""baba"" rule at 3 steps to the left and 2 steps down. Wait, the active rules say ""baba is you"", so I'm Baba. So my position must be where the ""baba"" rule is located. The rule is at 3 steps left and 2 steps down from where? Maybe from the player's position? Or is the rule's position separate? This might be a bit confusing.

The key is at 6 steps to the right and 1 step up. The walls are blocking the path. So I need to move right to get closer to the key. Let's check the movement. The current position of Baba (from the rule) is 3 steps left and 2 steps down. If I move right, that would bring me closer. But are there walls in the way?

Looking at the objects, there's a wall at 2 steps right and 4 up, and other walls down. But the path to the key is probably through the lower part. Let me see the map layout.

The key is at (assuming starting point as reference) maybe down a few steps. The door is at 5 steps right and 2 up. Maybe the door can be opened by making the key win, but since key is already win, maybe opening the door isn't necessary. Alternatively, maybe the door is a stop, but if I can change the rule to make door not stop, that could help.

Wait, the active rules are ""key is win"", ""wall is stop"", and ""baba is you"". So walls are Stops, so I can't move through them. The key is the win condition, so picking it up should let me win. But how to reach it.

Looking at the objects again: the key is 6 steps right and 1 step up from the baba rule's position. The walls are at various positions. Let's try to visualize:

Baba's position is 3 left and 2 down from some reference. Maybe the key is to the northeast. But the path might be blocked by walls. For example, there's a wall at 2 steps right and 1 step up. So moving right from Baba's position might hit that wall.

Alternatively, maybe moving down towards the key. The key is 1 step up, so perhaps moving up from Baba's position. But need to check if there are walls in the way. The wall at 2 steps right and 1 step up is a problem. So maybe need to find a way around it.

Alternatively, can I rearrange the rules? The key is part of the rule ""key is win"". If I can move that rule to make something else the win, but the goal is usually to grab the key. Alternatively, maybe change ""wall is stop"" to something else, like ""wall is push"", then move through walls. But can I move the text blocks?

The rules are formed by text blocks. So the ""key is win"" rule is made of the text blocks 'key', 'is', 'win' placed horizontally. To change a rule, I need to move those text blocks. For example, to make ""wall is not stop"", I would need to replace 'stop' with another property. But how?

First, I need to locate the text blocks. The rule ""key is win"" is at positions 5,6,7 steps right and 4 up. To break this rule, I would need to move one of these blocks. But if I move 'win' to another position, maybe I can create a new rule. Alternatively, move 'is' to connect different subjects and properties.

But the problem is that I might be blocked by walls. Let's see. If I'm at the position of the 'baba' rule (3 left, 2 down), how do I move? Let's assume my position is (0,0) for simplicity. Then the 'baba' rule is at (-3, -2). The key is at (6, 1). The walls are at various coordinates. The wall at (2,1) is a problem. So moving right from (-3,-2) towards the key, I need to go right 5 steps to reach x=2, but there's a wall at (2,1). So maybe I need to go around.

Alternatively, move up first. From (-3,-2), moving up to (-3,-1), then right. But check if there are walls. At (2,3 step up) there's a wall. Maybe the path is blocked.

Alternatively, can I push the wall? But walls are stop, so I can't. Unless I change the rule to make walls not stop. For example, if I can move the 'stop' property from 'wall' to something else. The current rule is ""wall is stop"", located at 1 left and 3 step up. So if I can move that 'stop' text block to another object, like making 'door stop' or 'key stop', then walls wouldn't be stop anymore.

But to do that, I need to reach the 'stop' rule. The 'stop' rule is at 1 left and 3 step up from the reference point. If my current position is (-3,-2), moving to ( -4, 1) to get to the 'stop' rule? Not sure. This is getting complicated.

Alternatively, focus on getting the key. Since the key is win, maybe I can just reach it. The path is blocked by walls, but perhaps there's a way around. Let's see the map:

- The key is at (6,1).
- There's a wall at (2,1), which is on the way.
- There's a door at (5,2). Maybe opening the door would allow passage, but how? The door's rule is ""door"" at (5,2). To open it, maybe change its property. But without changing rules, the door is just a door.

Alternatively, use the fact that Baba is you. If I can make myself a key, then grabbing the key wouldn't be necessary. For example, create a rule ""baba is key"", which would make me a key, and since key is win, then I win by being a key. But how to create that rule.

To create ""baba is key"", I need to have the text blocks 'baba', 'is', 'key' in a row. The existing 'baba' rule is at (-3,-2), 'is' is at (-2,-2), and 'you' is at (-1,-2). The 'key' text block is part of the ""key is win"" rule at (5,4), (6,4), (7,4). So if I can move the 'key' block down to connect with the 'baba' and 'is' blocks, that would create the new rule.

But how to move the 'key' block. To move an object or text block, it must not be defined as stop. The current rules are wall is stop, but other objects like 'baba', 'key', 'door' are not stop. So I can move them.

So the plan is: move the 'key' text block from (7,4) to connect with 'baba' and 'is' at (-3,-2), (-2,-2), (-1,-2). But the path might be blocked. Let's see the positions.

The 'key' is at (7,4). To get to the 'baba' rule area, need to move left and down. But there are walls along the way. For example, at (2,3) there's a wall. So moving left from (7,4) to (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), etc., but there's a wall at (2,3) step up? Wait, maybe the coordinates are relative. This is getting a bit confusing without a visual grid.

Alternatively, focus on moving right towards the key. If I can get past the wall at (2,1), maybe by changing the wall's rule. For example, move the 'stop' property from 'wall' to 'door', making walls passable. The 'stop' rule is at ( -1, 1) (assuming reference is Baba's position). To reach there, I need to move left and up.

From Baba's position (-3,-2), moving left to (-4,-2), then up to (-4,-1), (-4,0), (-4,1). But are there walls in that path? Looking at the objects, there's a wall at (2,3 step up) which might not be in the way. Alternatively, moving up from (-3,-2) to (-3,-1), then left to (-4,-1), etc. But again, not sure about the exact positions.

This is quite challenging without seeing the actual grid. But the main steps would be:

1. Either navigate to the key while avoiding walls by moving around them.
2. Or rearrange the rules to make walls not stop, allowing passage.
3. Or create a new rule making Baba a key to win immediately.

Given the time I've spent and previous failed attempts, maybe trying to move right towards the key, step by step, until I can grab it. But the walls are blocking that path. Alternatively, move down towards the key's location.

Another idea: since the key is a win, maybe I don't need to pick it up physically but just have the rule ""key is win"" and be near it. But I think you have to touch the key to win. Not sure.

Alternatively, push a wall out of the way if walls can be pushed. But walls are stop, so probably can't.

Wait, the ""door"" is a rule at (5,2). If I can change the door's property to not be stop, then maybe I can use the door. But how? The door's rule is just ""door"", so unless there's a ""door is stop"" rule, which there isn't. The ""stop"" rule is only for walls. So the door is passable unless there's another rule making it stop. So maybe I can move through the door.

But the key is behind walls. Let's think differently. Maybe the solution is to create a new rule that makes Baba a winner without needing the key. For example, ""baba is win"". To do that, I need to move the 'win' text block from the ""key is win"" rule to connect with 'baba' and 'is'.

The 'win' block is at (7,4). The 'baba' and 'is' are at (-3,-2), (-2,-2). So I need to move the 'win' block from (7,4) to, say, ( -1,-2 ), forming ""baba is win"". But how to move it there without obstacles.

The path from (7,4) to (-1,-2) would require moving left and down. There are walls along the way, like at (2,3 step up) which might be at (2,3) if the reference is (0,0). Not sure. This is tricky.

Alternatively, move the 'is' block from (-2,-2) to connect with 'baba' and 'win'. But again, pathing is an issue.

Maybe the intended solution is to move the 'key' rule to make Baba the key. For example, take the 'key' block and move it next to 'baba' and 'is'. So from the current position of 'key' at (7,4), move it down to (7,3), (7,2), etc., until it's at the same level as 'baba' and 'is' which are at y=-2. So moving down 6 steps? That seems too far and might be blocked by walls.

Alternatively, move the 'win' block to make 'baba' win. But 'win' is at (7,4). To get there, move right and up. But there are walls at higher y positions.

This is really challenging. Considering the previous actions were right and left, maybe the solution is simply to keep moving right until reaching the key, assuming the path clears. But the walls are still there.

Wait, looking at the latest observation, the key is at 6 steps right and 1 step up. The 'baba' rule is at 3 steps left and 2 steps down. So if I move right 6 steps, I'd reach x=3 (since starting at x=-3), no. Wait, positions are relative. Maybe the 'baba' rule is at ( -3, -2 ). So to get to the key at (6,1), I need to move right 9 steps and up 3 steps. But there are walls blocking the way.

Alternatively, the door at (5,2) might be a way through. If I can reach the door and maybe interact with it, but I don't know the rules for doors.

Another angle: the 'key is win' rule means that touching the key makes you win. So I need to path to the key. The key is at (6,1). The path from (-3,-2) to (6,1) requires moving right 9 steps and up 3 steps. But there's a wall at (2,1), which is on the way. So maybe move around that wall by going up or down.

From (-3,-2), moving up to (-3,-1), then right to (2,-1), but there's a wall at (2,3 step up), which might be at (2,1) if moving up from (-3,-1). Not sure.

Alternatively, move down to (-3,-3), then right. But there's a wall at (4 steps right and 2 step down?), not sure.

This is really tough. Maybe the solution is to move the 'stop' property from wall to something else, allowing movement through walls. For example, create a new rule ""wall is push"" or ""wall is you"". To do that, I need to move the 'stop' text block from the ""wall is stop"" rule to connect with 'wall' and another property.

The ""wall is stop"" rule is at ( -1, 1 ) (assuming reference is Baba's position). So the 'wall' text block is at ( -2,1 ), 'is' at ( -1,1 ), 'stop' at ( 0,1 ). To change 'stop' to another property, say 'push', I need to move the 'stop' block next to 'push' or another property. But there's no 'push' block currently. So I would have to create it by moving existing blocks.

Alternatively, take the 'stop' block and move it next to 'wall' and 'push' (if available), but I don't see a 'push' block. Maybe 'win' can be used? Not sure.

This is getting too complicated. Given the time I've spent, maybe the intended action is to move right towards the key, assuming that eventually the path clears or there's a way around. So the chosen action is 'right'.

The active rules are key is win, wall is stop, and baba is you. So, the goal is to get the key, which is acting as the win condition. But usually, walls are stop, but since the rule says wall is stop, I have to avoid them. Since I'm Baba, and baba is you, I can move around.

Looking at the objects, the key is way to the right, at 5 steps right and 1 step up. But there are walls blocking the path. The door is at 4 steps right and 2 steps up. Maybe I can move towards the door first? But how do I pass through walls? The rule says wall is stop, so I can't go through them. Unless I can change a rule to make walls not stop. Like, if I can make wall something else, maybe I can walk through them.

Wait, the key is the win, so maybe I need to pick it up. But to get there, there's a wall at 1 step right and 1 step up, and another wall at 1 step right. The key is at 5 steps right and 1 step up. So between me and the key, there are several walls. Maybe I need to move the 'stop' property from wall to something else. But how?

The text blocks on the map: There's a rule 'wall is stop' at 4 steps left and 3 step up. Also, there's a 'key is win', 'is' blocks, etc. To change a rule, I have to move the 'is' block and rearrange them. For example, if I can make 'stop' be a different object, like 'key' or 'baba', then walls wouldn't be stop anymore.

So, the plan is: move to the 'is' block that's connected to 'wall is stop', and then rearrange it to change the stop property. Let's see where the 'wall is stop' rule is. The rule 'wall' is at 4 step left and 3 step up, then 'is' is at 3 step left and 3 step up, then 'stop' at 2 step left and 3 step up. So the rule is formed by those three objects.

To change this rule, I need to move either 'wall', 'is', or 'stop' to form a new rule. For example, if I make 'stop' be 'key', then walls would not be stop. But how to do that? I would have to move the 'stop' text block next to 'key' and 'is'. The key is at 4 steps right and 4 step up. There's a rule 'key' at 4 steps right and 4 step up, 'is' at 5, and 'win' at 6. So if I can take the 'stop' block (which is at 2 step left and 3 step up) and move it next to 'key' and 'is', then the new rule would be 'key is stop', which would mean keys are stop. That's bad. Not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe move 'stop' to be associated with 'baba'. But 'baba' is defined as 'you'. The rule for 'baba' is at 4 step left and 2 steps down, 'is' at 3 step left and 2 steps down, 'you' at 2 step left and 2 steps down. So if I can change 'baba is you' to 'baba is stop', then I would be stop, which is bad. So that's not good.

Wait, maybe the best approach is to create a new rule that makes 'door' a win. Because there's a door at 4 steps right and 2 steps up. If I can make 'door is win', then reaching the door would win the level. But how to create that rule? The current rules are key is win, wall is stop, baba is you. The text blocks available are the ones listed. The 'door' rule is present at 6 steps right and 2 step up. So, to make 'door is win', I need to take the 'door' block, the 'is' block, and the 'win' block and arrange them together.

Looking at the current setup: The 'win' block is at 6 steps right and 4 step up. The 'is' block is at 5 steps right and 4 step up. The 'key' block is at 4 steps right and 4 step up. So the 'key is win' rule is in that area. To make 'door is win', I need to move the 'door' block (which is at 6 steps right and 2 step up) up to the area where the other rules are. But the path is blocked by walls. The wall at 4 steps right and 2 step up is a problem. Unless I can change the wall rule to not be stop.

Alternatively, maybe I can push the door block up past the wall by making walls passable. If I can change the 'wall is stop' rule to something else, like 'wall is you', then I could walk through walls. But how? Let's see. The 'wall is stop' rule is at positions 4 left, 3 up; 3 left, 3 up (is); and 2 left, 3 up (stop). To change this, I need to rearrange these blocks. For example, take the 'stop' block and move it next to 'baba' instead. But 'baba's rule is at 4 left, 2 down; 3 left, 2 down (is); 2 left, 2 down (you). If I move 'stop' to be next to 'baba' and 'is', making 'baba is stop', then I would be stop, which can't be moved. Not helpful.

Alternatively, take the 'wall' block from the 'wall is stop' rule and move it elsewhere. But the 'wall' block is at 4 left, 3 up. If I move it next to 'door' and 'win', then 'door is win' would be created. But how to get there? The path is blocked by walls. Unless I can make walls passable.

This is tricky. Maybe the first step is to reach the 'is' block of the 'wall is stop' rule and rearrange it. Let's see where the agent (Baba) is. The 'baba' rule is at 1 step left and 2 steps down, with 'is' at 1 right, 2 down, and 'you' at 2 right, 2 down. So the agent is at the position of the 'baba' text block? Or is the agent separate? Wait, in Baba Is You, the player controls the object that is 'you'. Since 'baba is you', the agent is Baba. So the agent's position is where the Baba tile is, which is likely at the position of the 'baba' rule's subject, which is at 1 step left and 2 steps down.

So the agent is at 1 left, 2 down. The goal is to get to the key at 5 right, 1 up. But the path is blocked by walls. So the agent needs to either move around the walls or change the rules to make walls passable.

Another approach: Since the key is the win condition, and it's on the other side of walls, maybe the solution is to push the walls aside. But can't push walls because they are 'stop'. Unless we change their property.

Alternatively, create a new rule that makes Baba able to move through walls. For example, 'baba is not stop'. But how to create that rule? We need to have the text blocks for 'baba', 'is', and 'not stop'. But 'not' isn't a property here. The existing rules are 'key is win', 'wall is stop', 'baba is you'. There's no 'not' block. So maybe that's not possible.

Wait, the available text blocks include 'door', 'key', 'is', 'win', 'wall', 'stop', 'baba', 'you'. So to make a new rule like 'baba is not stop', we would need a 'not' block, which isn't present. So that's not possible.

So back to the original idea: Change the 'wall is stop' rule to something else. For example, make 'wall is key', which would make walls act like keys. But keys are win, so walls would be win. That might not help. Or make 'wall is you', so walls are controllable. Then the agent could turn into a wall and move through other walls. But how?

If 'wall is you', then any wall tile becomes a 'you' object, meaning you can control it. So if the agent can turn into a wall, they could move through other walls. But to do that, the rule would need to be 'wall is you'. Currently, it's 'wall is stop'.

So to create 'wall is you', we need to rearrange the 'wall', 'is', and 'you' blocks. The 'you' block is at 2 step left and 2 steps down. The 'wall' block is at 4 step left and 3 step up. The 'is' block is at 3 step left and 3 step up. So the current 'wall is stop' rule is wall (4 left,3 up) - is (3 left,3 up) - stop (2 left,3 up). To make 'wall is you', we need to connect wall (4 left,3 up) - is (3 left,3 up) - you (2 left,2 down). But the 'you' block is below, not at the same level. So the agent would have to move the 'you' block up or the 'is' and 'wall' blocks down.

This requires moving multiple blocks, which might be possible. The agent's current position is at the 'baba' rule's subject, which is 1 step left and 2 steps down. Let's see the positions:

- 'baba' rule: subject at 1 left, 2 down; 'is' at 1 right, 2 down; 'you' at 2 right, 2 down.
- The agent (Baba) is likely at the 'baba' tile, which is at 1 left, 2 down.

So the agent is at 1 left, 2 down. To reach the 'wall is stop' rule components:

- 'wall' block is at 4 left, 3 up.
- 'is' block is at 3 left, 3 up.
- 'stop' block is at 2 left, 3 up.

The distance is quite far. The agent needs to move up and right. But the path is blocked by walls. For example, from 1 left, 2 down, moving up to 1 left, 3 up: is there a wall? Looking at the objects:

At 1 left, 3 up: there's a wall (rule 'wall' is at 4 left,3 up, but that's the 'wall' text block. The actual wall objects are at various positions, like 4 right,4 up; 1 right,3 up; etc.

This is getting complicated. Maybe a better approach is to move towards the 'door' and try to create a 'door is win' rule. The door is at 4 right, 2 up. To create 'door is win', we need the 'door', 'is', and 'win' blocks. The 'win' block is at 6 right,4 up. The 'is' block is at 5 right,4 up. The 'door' block is at 4 right,2 up.

So the agent would need to move from 1 left,2 down to 4 right,2 up (the door), then move up to 4 right,3 up (wall), but that's a wall. Unless we can make walls passable. Alternatively, move the 'win' block down to the door's level.

But this requires moving text blocks, which can only be done if they're not 'stop'. The 'win' block is part of the 'key is win' rule. Since 'key is win' is a rule, maybe the text blocks are movable as long as they're not part of an active 'stop' property. Wait, in Baba Is You, the text blocks that are part of a rule can be moved unless the rule includes 'stop' or similar. Since 'wall is stop', the 'wall', 'is', and 'stop' blocks are part of a rule that includes 'stop', but can they still be moved?

Actually, in the game, any text block that is not defined as 'STOP' or another immovable property can be moved. So even though 'wall is stop', the 'wall', 'is', and 'stop' text blocks can still be moved because the rule is 'wall is stop', which makes walls stop, but the text blocks themselves are not stopped. So the agent can move those text blocks.

So, the plan is:

1. Move the 'stop' text block from its current position (2 left,3 up) to somewhere else to free up the 'wall is stop' rule.
2. Rearrange the 'wall', 'is', and new property (like 'you' or 'key') to create a new rule, such as 'wall is you', allowing the agent to become a wall and pass through other walls.
3. Once walls are passable, move through them to reach the key or door.

Alternatively, create a 'door is win' rule:

1. Move the 'door' block (4 right,2 up) to the area of the 'win' rule (6 right,4 up).
2. Connect it with 'is' and 'win' to form 'door is win', allowing the agent to reach the door and win.

But moving the 'door' block up to 4 right,4 up would require moving past walls. Let's see the path:

From door at 4 right,2 up to 4 right,4 up: up two steps. But there's a wall at 4 right,3 up. So the agent would need to move around that wall. If the agent can make the wall passable, then they can go around.

Alternatively, push the wall block. But since walls are 'stop', the agent can't push them. Unless the rule is changed.

This is quite complex. Another angle: Since the key is the win, and it's on the other side of multiple walls, maybe the intended solution is to change the 'key is win' rule to make the door the win condition. For example, create 'door is win' by rearranging the text blocks.

The 'door' is at 4 right,2 up. The 'win' is at 6 right,4 up. The 'is' is at 5 right,4 up. So to make 'door is win', the agent needs to move the 'door' block to 4 right,4 up, then place 'is' and 'win' next to it.

But the distance is 2 steps up from the door's current position. The agent is at 1 left,2 down. To get to the door, the agent needs to move right 5 steps and up 2 steps. But there are walls blocking the path. For example, at 4 right,1 up is a wall, and at 4 right,2 up is the door. So the agent can move right to 4 right,2 up (the door), then up to 4 right,3 up (a wall), then can't proceed. Unless they can push the wall.

But walls are stop, so can't be pushed. So unless the rule changes.

Alternatively, move the 'door' block up to the rule area. The agent is at 1 left,2 down. To reach the door at 4 right,2 up, the agent needs to move right 5 times and up 2 times. But there's a wall at 4 right,3 up. So moving up from the door would hit a wall.

This seems difficult. Maybe the solution is to first change the 'wall is stop' rule to 'wall is key' or something else. For example, moving the 'stop' block to be next to 'key' and 'is', making 'key is stop'. Then walls would not be stop, but keys would be. That might not help.

Alternatively, move the 'wall' block from the 'wall is stop' rule to be next to 'door' and 'win', making 'door is wall'. But that doesn't help either.

Alternatively, create a new rule 'baba is stop', but that would make the agent stop, which is bad.

Wait, the agent is Baba, and 'baba is you'. So the agent can move. To reach the key, which is at 5 right,1 up, the agent needs to go through several walls. If the agent can make themselves not stop, like 'baba is win' or something. But how?

If the agent can create a rule 'baba is win', then reaching any Baba tile would win. But the key is the win condition, so maybe that's conflicting. Not sure.

Alternatively, create 'baba is key', making the agent a key, which is win. Then standing on the agent's tile (Baba) would make them a key and thus win. But the key is already a win, so maybe that works. But how to create 'baba is key'?

The 'key' block is at 4 right,4 up. The 'is' block is at 5 right,4 up. The 'baba' block is at 1 left,2 down. So the agent would need to move the 'key', 'is', and 'baba' blocks together. That requires moving across the map, but there are walls in the way.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe the intended solution is to move the 'win' property from key to door by rearranging the text blocks. Let's see:

The current 'key is win' rule is at 4 right,4 up (key), 5 right,4 up (is), 6 right,4 up (win). To make 'door is win', we need to move the 'win' block to be next to 'door' and 'is'. The door is at 4 right,2 up. So the agent would need to move the 'win' block from 6 right,4 up to 4 right,4 up (same x as door, y one less). But how?

The agent is at 1 left,2 down. To reach 6 right,4 up, that's a long way. There are walls blocking the path. For example, at 4 right,3 up is a wall. So the agent can't move directly there.

Alternatively, move the 'win' block first. The 'win' block is part of the 'key is win' rule. Since 'key is win' is a rule, but the text blocks aren't stopped unless 'stop' is in the rule. So the 'win' block can","

Let's try to figure out how to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. The goal is usually to reach the win object, which is currently the key. The active rules are key is win, wall is stop, and baba is you. So, as Baba, I can move around, but walls block me.

Looking at the map, the key is 5 steps to the right and 1 step up from my current position. But there's a wall directly in the way at 1 step right and 1 step up. The wall is a stop, so I can't pass through it. The door is at 4 steps right and 2 steps up, but I don't know if that's useful yet.

The rules are all spread out. The key, is, and win text blocks are grouped to the right above. Maybe I can rearrange them to change the rules. For example, if I can make ""baba is win"" or ""key is you"", that could help. But first, I need to move those text blocks.

The rule ""key is win"" is important because the goal is to make key the win object. However, since the key is already defined as win, maybe I need to get it and then place it somewhere else? Or perhaps change the rule so that reaching Baba becomes the win condition.

Wait, the active rules say ""baba is you"", so I am Baba. If I can change the rule to ""baba is win"", then I could just stand on myself to win. To do that, I need to move the 'baba', 'is', and 'win' text blocks together. Let's check their positions.

The 'baba' rule is 4 steps to the left and 2 steps down from me. The 'is' is 3 steps to the left and 2 steps down, and 'win' is 2 steps to the left and 2 steps down. So they're all clustered together below me. If I can move those three text blocks to form ""baba is win"", that would work. 

But how do I move them? The walls are stop, so I can only move objects that aren't stopped. The text blocks might be movable unless they're part of a rule that makes them stop. Let me check the active rules again. The only stop is 'wall is stop', so the text blocks should be movable unless they're defined as stop. Since they're part of rules, they might be movable. 

So, I need to move the 'baba', 'is', and 'win' text blocks to form a new rule. Let's say I move 'baba' to the left, 'is' next to it, and 'win' after that. That would make ""baba is win"", which would mean I (as baba) am the win condition. Then, I could just stand there and win. 

But how to reach those text blocks? They're 4 steps to the left and 2 steps down from my current position. Let me see the path. From where I am (position not specified exactly, but based on the objects), moving left twice and down two steps would get me to the 'baba' rule. But there might be walls in the way. 

Looking at the objects, there's a wall at 1 step right and 1 step up, but that's blocking the key. The path to the left and down seems clear. Let's see: moving left from my current position (assuming I'm at position 0,0 maybe?), each step left and down. But I need to avoid walls. The wall at 1 step right and 1 step up is not in the way when moving left. 

Alternatively, maybe I should first move towards the text blocks. Let's try moving left to reach the 'baba' rule. But wait, the previous actions were right, left, right, etc., and the system kept failing. Maybe the direction steps need to be more precise. 

The observation shows objects at specific steps relative to the player. For example, the 'baba' rule is 4 steps to the left and 2 steps down. So to reach it, I need to move left 4 times and down 2 times. But perhaps there's a better way. 

Alternatively, maybe I can push the text blocks by moving them one by one. Since I'm Baba, and the rules are 'baba is you', I can push things unless they're stopped. The 'wall' is stop, so anything else can be moved. 

So the plan is: move to the 'baba' rule, pick it up, and place it next to 'is' and 'win' to form ""baba is win"". Let's break it down step by step. 

First, I need to navigate to the 'baba' rule, which is 4 steps left and 2 down. But each move is one step. So from my current position, moving left 4 times and down 2 times. However, I need to check if there are any walls in the way. The walls are at specific positions, like 1 step right and 4 up, but the path left and down might be clear. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a shorter path. Let's see the objects again. The 'baba' rule is at 4 left, 2 down. The 'is' is 3 left, 2 down. The 'win' is 2 left, 2 down. So they're all in a vertical line, each one step to the right of each other, same down position. To form ""baba is win"", I need to arrange them horizontally. 

So maybe move the 'win' text block one step to the left, then 'is' next to it, then 'baba' next to 'is'. That way, it reads ""baba is win"". 

To do that, I need to move the 'win' block left, which is currently 2 steps left and 2 down. Moving it left once would place it at 3 left, 2 down, next to 'is' (which is at 3 left, 2 down). Wait, the 'is' is already at 3 left, 2 down. So perhaps I need to move 'win' left past 'is'? But can I push 'is' out of the way? 

Since the 'is' is part of the existing rule ""key is win"", but maybe once I move it, the rule changes. But the active rules are still ""key is win"", ""wall is stop"", and ""baba is you"". So moving the 'is' block should be allowed. 

This is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to outline the steps:

1. Move to the 'win' text block (2 left, 2 down).
2. Move left once to position 3 left, 2 down, which is where the 'is' block is.
3. Since I can't stack them, maybe I need to move the 'is' block first.
4. Move the 'is' block left to make space for 'win'.
5. Then move 'win' into place.
6. Then move 'baba' to the leftmost position.

But each move requires a single step. Let's see. Starting from my current position, which seems to be at 1 step right (since the wall is 1 step right and 4 up), but maybe my position is variable. This is getting a bit confusing without a visual grid. 

Alternatively, since the 'baba', 'is', and 'win' blocks are all clustered together 2 steps down and 4,3,2 steps left respectively, I can move down 2 steps first, then left 4,3,2 steps to reach each block. 

But I need to avoid walls. The walls are at various positions, but the main obstacle is the wall at 1 step right and 1 step up blocking the key. When moving left and down, the path should be clear. 

Once I have the three text blocks arranged as ""baba is win"", then the rule changes, and I (as Baba) become the win condition. So I can just stay in place and win. 

Alternatively, if I can make ""key is you"", then picking up the key would make me win. But the key is currently defined as win, so changing it to ""key is you"" would let me carry the key to the win condition. 

But the active rule is ""key is win"", so the key is the win object. If I can change that to ""key is you"", then I can just grab the key and then go to where the win condition is (which might be another object, but the win condition is currently the key). Hmm, this is a bit conflicting. 

Wait, the active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". So the win condition is the key. To win, I need to reach the key. But the key is behind a wall. So maybe the solution is to remove the ""wall is stop"" rule, allowing me to push the wall or move through it. 

To remove ""wall is stop"", I need to break that rule. In Baba Is You, to break a rule, you can either separate the subject and property by moving them apart or make the rule say something else. 

For example, if the rule is ""wall is stop"", I can move the ""stop"" text block away from ""wall"", making it ""wall is [nothing]"", which would deactivate that rule. Alternatively, change ""stop"" to another property. 

So another approach: move the ""stop"" text block from the ""wall is stop"" rule. The ""stop"" is currently 1 step to the right and 3 step up. If I can move that ""stop"" block elsewhere, then the rule becomes ""wall is"", which is inactive, and walls would no longer be stop. Then I could move through the walls. 

But how to move the ""stop"" block? It's a text block, so unless it's stopped by another rule, I can move it. The only stop rule is ""wall is stop"", but that's the rule we're trying to break. So once I move the ""stop"" away, the rule is broken, and the ""stop"" block becomes movable. 

So steps for this approach:

1. Move to the ""stop"" text block at 1 step right and 3 step up.
2. Move it to a different position, say, to the right or left, breaking the ""wall is stop"" rule.
3. Now walls are no longer stop, so I can walk through them.
4. Go around the wall to the key and pick it up, then reach the win condition (which is the key itself).

But the key is at 5 steps right and 1 step up. There's a wall at 1 step right and 1 step up, but if walls are no longer stop, I can move through that wall. So after removing ""wall is stop"", I can move through walls and go straight to the key. 

This seems plausible. Let's outline the steps:

- Navigate to the ""stop"" block (1 right, 3 up).
- Move it left or right to break the ""wall is stop"" rule.
- Now walls are passable.
- Move up to the key, which is 5 right and 1 up. Since the path is clear (no stop blocks), I can go there.
- Since the key is the win condition, picking it up or reaching it would win the level.

But wait, the key is already the win condition. If I just reach it, I win. So after making walls passable, I can go around the wall and grab the key. 

Alternatively, if I change the rule to ""key is you"", then carrying the key would make me the win condition. But that might be more complex. 

Let me try the first approach: removing ""wall is stop"".

To do that, I need to move the ""stop"" text block. Where is it located? According to the observation, the ""stop"" rule is at 1 step to the right and 3 step up. So from my current position, I need to move up 3 steps and right 1 step to reach it. 

But how do I get there? Let's see. My current position is not explicitly stated, but the objects are relative. Assuming I'm at a starting point, perhaps the ""baba"" rule is 4 steps left and 2 down, so my position is 4 right and 2 up from the ""baba"" rule. 

This is getting too ambiguous without a grid. Maybe I should focus on the immediate objects around me. 

Looking at the latest observation, the active rules are still ""key is win"", ""wall is stop"", and ""baba is you"". The key is at 5 steps right and 1 up, behind a wall. The ""stop"" block is at 1 right, 3 up. 

If I can move the ""stop"" block, say, one step to the right, then the rule becomes ""wall is "", which is inactive. Then I can move through walls. 

To move the ""stop"" block, I need to be adjacent to it. My current position isn't clear, but perhaps I'm near the bottom of the map. The ""baba"" rule is at 4 left, 2 down, so maybe I'm to the right of that. 

Alternatively, maybe I should move towards the ""stop"" block. Let's assume I need to move up 3 steps and right 1 step to reach it. But there's a wall at 1 step right and 1 step up. If walls are stop, I can't pass through it. So this approach might not work unless I first remove the ""wall is stop"" rule, which is recursive. 

This is a classic Baba Is You puzzle where you have to break your own rule to proceed. So the solution is to move the ""stop"" text block away from the ""wall"" rule. 

Let me try to execute that. 

First, move up 3 steps to reach the ""stop"" block's y-coordinate (3 step up). Then move right 1 step to be adjacent to the ""stop"" block. Once there, I can push it left or right. For example, move left to position 0 step right and 3 step up, breaking the ""wall is stop"" rule. 

After doing that, walls are no longer stop, so I can walk through them. Then move up to the key's location (5 right, 1 up), go around the wall at 1 right, 1 up (now passable), and grab the key. Since the key is the win condition, picking it up or standing on it would win the level. 

But how to move the ""stop"" block? Each move is one step. So from my current position, I need to navigate to the ""stop"" block. If I'm at position (0,0), the ""stop"" block is at (1,3). To get there, move right once and up three times. But there's a wall at (1,1). Since walls are stop, I can't move through them. This creates a problem because I can't reach the ""stop"" block without passing through a wall. 

This is a catch-22. To remove the ""wall is stop"" rule, I need to move the ""stop"" block, but I can't get to it because the path is blocked by a wall that's made stop by the same rule. 

So I need another approach. Maybe instead of moving the ""stop"" block, I can change the rule to something else. For example, make ""wall is push"" or ""wall is you"", but that might not help. 

Alternatively, create a new rule that allows moving through walls. For example, ""wall is you"", which would let me move through walls as if they were Baba. But to do that, I need to rearrange the text blocks to form ""wall is you"". 

The ""wall"" rule is at 4 step left and 3 step up. The ""is"" is at 3 step left and 3 step up. The ""you"" is at 2 step left and 2 step down. So to form ""wall is you"", I need to bring the ""you"" block up to the ""wall"" and ""is"" blocks. 

This might be possible. Let's see. The ""you"" block is currently 2 step left and 2 step down from the ""wall"" and ""is"" blocks. So I need to move the ""you"" block up 1 step and right 1 step to align with the ""wall is"" part. 

But moving the ""you"" block requires getting there. From my current position, it's 4 left and 2 down to reach the ""baba"" rule, but the ""you"" block is in a different area. This might involve moving through other objects. 

Alternatively, focus on creating ""baba is win"". The ""baba"" rule is at 4 left, 2 down. The ""is"" is at 3 left, 2 down. The ""win"" is at 2 left, 2 down. So they're all in a vertical line. To make them horizontal, I need to move the ""win"" block left past the ""is"" and ""baba"". 

For example, move the ""win"" block left once to be next to ""is"", then move ""is"" left to be next to ""baba"". That would form ""baba is win"". 

To do this, I need to:

1. Move to the ""win"" block (2 left, 2 down).
2. Move left once to position 3 left, 2 down (where ""is"" is).
3. Since ""is"" is already there, I need to move ""is"" first. Move ""is"" left to 2 left, 2 down.
4. Then move ""win"" to 3 left, 2 down.
5. Then move ""baba"" left to 3 left, 2 down, but ""baba"" is at 4 left, 2 down. So move ""baba"" left once to 3 left, 2 down, next to ""is"" and ""win"".

This arrangement would make ""baba is win"", meaning I (as Baba) am the win condition. Then I can just stay in place and win. 

But how to execute this step by step? Let's break it down:

- Start at my current position (unknown, but assuming near the bottom).
- Navigate to the ""win"" block at 2 left, 2 down. This requires moving left 2 times and down 2 times.
- Once at the ""win"" block, move left once to position 3 left, 2 down. But there's the ""is"" block there. So I need to move the ""is"" block out of the way first.
- Move to the ""is"" block at 3 left, 2 down. Move it left once to 2 left, 2 down.
- Now, move the ""win"" block to 3 left, 2 down.
- Then move the ""baba"" block from 4 left, 2 down to 3 left, 2 down, next to ""is"" and ""win"".

This would form the rule ""b","

Let's try to figure out how to solve this Baba Is You level. The active rules are key is win, wall is stop, and baba is you. My goal is usually to reach the win object, which is the key in this case. The problem is that the key is behind walls that are labeled as stop, so I can't move through them.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see several walls and rules scattered around. The key is at position 5 steps to the right and 1 step up. There's also a door at 4 steps right and 2 steps up. But since the walls are stop, I need a way to remove their stop property or create a path.

The key is defined as win, so if I can get to it, I win. But the path is blocked. Maybe I can rearrange the rules. Let's see the rules available. There's a rule `key` at 4 right, 4 up, then `is` and `win` following. If I can move these text blocks to create a new rule, maybe something like ""door is win"" or ""baba is win"", that could change the objective. Alternatively, changing ""wall is stop"" to something else so I can pass through the walls.

Another idea: since ""baba is you"", I can push other objects if they're not stop. Wait, but the walls are stop, so I can't push them. The ball is there; maybe I can use it to block or move something else. But I'm not sure. Let me check the positions again.

The door is at 4 right, 2 up. Maybe if I can make the door a win, then I can go through it. To do that, I need to create a rule like ""door is win"". But the existing rules are ""key is win"", so I need to break that rule or replace it. To break a rule, I might need to move the ""is"" or ""win"" text blocks.

Looking at the rule sections, the ""key is win"" is made of three blocks: rule `key`, then `is`, then `win`. If I can move the `win` block to attach to `door` instead, that would change the rule. For example, move the `win` block next to `door` and `is` to make ""door is win"".

But how do I move those blocks? The player (Baba) is located at a position that's 4 steps to the left and 2 steps down relative to the `baba` rule. Wait, no, the `baba` rule is at 4 steps left and 2 steps down from the current position. So maybe the player is at position (0,0), and the `baba` rule is at (-4, -2). So to get to the `key` rule, which is at (4,4), I need to move right and up. But the path is blocked by walls.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the `win` block from the ""key is win"" rule to attach to the `door`. The `win` block is at (6,4). If I can move it down to the `door` which is at (4,2), that could work. But how to move it? Since I'm Baba, and the rules say ""baba is you"", I can push objects that are not stop. The `win` block is not stop unless it's part of a stop rule. The current stop rule is ""wall is stop"", so the `win` block is movable.

So the plan is: move the `win` block from (6,4) to (4,2) where the `door` is. Then, the rule becomes ""door is win"", and I can go through the door to win. To do this, I need to navigate to the `win` block, pick it up, and move it. But the path to the `win` block is through other blocks. Let's see the positions:

- The `win` block is at 6 steps right and 4 up. The player is probably near the `baba` rule at (-4,-2). So moving right four times and up four times would get to the `win` block. But along the way, there are walls at (4,4), (3,3), etc. Wait, the walls are at various positions, but the key is at (5,1). Maybe I need to find a path around the walls.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the `is` block from the ""key is win"" rule. The `is` block is at (5,4). If I can rearrange the ""key is win"" into ""key is stop"" or something else, but that might not help. Hmm.

Another approach: Since the key is win, maybe I can reach it by creating a path using other objects. The door is at (4,2). If I can make the door passable, like by changing its rule. But how?

Wait, the door's rule is not defined except for the ""door"" text block. If I can make ""door is you"", then maybe I can push it, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, if I can make ""door is win"", then stepping on it would win.

To do that, I need to take the `win` block and place it next to `door` and `is`. The `door` is at (4,2), and the `is` block is at (3,3). So maybe move the `win` block from (6,4) down to (4,2), which is two steps down and two steps left. But how to navigate there without hitting stop walls.

Alternatively, maybe move the `is` block from (5,4) to (4,2), so that the rule becomes ""door is win"". Let me see: the `door` is at (4,2), the `is` would need to be next to it, and then the `win` block. So if I can move the `is` block left to (4,2), then place the `win` block next to it, that would form ""door is win"".

But to move the `is` block, I need to be adjacent to it and move in the direction, right? The `is` block is at (5,4). The player is at, say, (0,0) based on the `baba` rule being at (-4,-2). So moving right five times and up four times to get to the `is` block. But along the way, there are walls at (4,4), (3,3), etc. So that path is blocked.

Hmm. Maybe there's another rule I can manipulate. The ""stop"" rule is at (2,3). If I can remove that, maybe walls aren't stop anymore. But how? To break the ""stop"" rule, I need to move its components. The ""stop"" rule is made of `wall`, `is`, `stop` at positions (4 left, 3 up), (3 left, 3 up), and (2 left, 3 up). If I can move the `stop` block, then the rule ""wall is stop"" would be broken. But moving the `stop` block would require it not to be stop. Wait, the rule says ""wall is stop"", which means any object named wall has the stop property. But if I can move the `stop` text block away, then the rule is no longer active. However, the `stop` block itself is an object; is it stop? Since the rule is ""wall is stop"", unless the `stop` block is considered a wall, it might be movable. But I'm not sure. The `stop` block is a text block, so maybe it's not affected by the ""wall is stop"" rule. So if I can move the `stop` block, then the ""wall is stop"" rule is broken, making walls passable.

So the plan is: move the `stop` block from (2 left, 3 up) to somewhere else, thus breaking the ""wall is stop"" rule. Then, the walls are no longer stop, and I can push them or walk through them. Once that's done, I can go around the walls to the key.

But how to move the `stop` block. The `stop` block is at (2 left, 3 up). If I can get to that position, which is two steps left and three steps up from the player's position, but the player is at (0,0) based on the `baba` rule being at (-4,-2). So moving left two and up three. But there might be walls in the way. Let's check the map:

At (1 left, 3 up): there's a `rule wall` at (4 step left and 3 step up?), wait the objects are listed as:

rule `wall` 2 step to the left and 3 step up

rule `is` 1 step to the left and 3 step up

rule `stop` 2 step to the left and 3 step up? Wait, the observation says:

""rule `wall` 2 step to the left and 3 step up

rule `is` 1 step to the left and 3 step up

rule `stop` 3 step up""

Wait, the exact positions might be a bit confusing. Let me parse the objects again:

Objects on the map:

- wall 1 step to the right and 4 step up

- rule `key` 4 steps to the right and 4 step up

- rule `is` 5 steps to the right and 4 step up

- rule `win` 6 steps to the right and 4 step up

- rule `wall` 4 step to the left and 3 step up

- rule `is` 3 step to the left and 3 step up

- rule `stop` 2 step to the left and 3 step up

- wall 1 step to the right and 3 step up

- ball 2 steps to the right and 3 step up

- wall 1 step to the right and 2 step up

- rule `door` 4 steps to the right and 2 step up

- wall 1 step to the right and 1 step up

- key 5 steps to the right and 1 step up

- wall 1 step to the right

- wall 1 step to the right and 1 step down

- rule `baba` 4 step to the left and 2 steps down

- rule `is` 3 step to the left and 2 steps down

- rule `you` 2 step to the left and 2 steps down

- wall 1 step to the right and 2 steps down

Assuming the player is at a position relative to these objects. The `baba` rule is at 4 steps left and 2 steps down. So if the player is Baba, then their position is 4 steps right and 2 steps up from the `baba` rule. Wait, the `baba` rule is at 4 step to the left and 2 steps down from the player's position. So player is at (4, 2) relative to the `baba` rule's position. But this is getting complicated. Maybe it's better to think in terms of grid coordinates.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is at (5,1), and the player needs to get there. To move right five times and down once. But the path is blocked by walls at (4,4), (3,3), etc. If I can remove the stop property from walls, then I can move through them. So focusing on moving the `stop` block.

The `stop` rule is composed of `wall is stop`, which is at positions:

- rule `wall` at 4 left, 3 up

- rule `is` at 3 left, 3 up

- rule `stop` at 2 left, 3 up

So these three blocks form the ""wall is stop"" rule. To break this rule, I need to move at least one of these blocks. The `stop` block is at 2 left, 3 up. If I can move that `stop` block, then the rule is no longer active.

Assuming the player is at (0,0), the `stop` block is at (-2,3). To get there, the player needs to move left two and up three. But along the way, are there any walls? Let's check the walls around that area.

Looking at the walls listed:

- wall 1 step to the right and 4 step up (position (1,4))

- wall at (4,4), (3,3), (1,3), (1,2), etc.

So moving left from (0,0) to (-2,3): the path would be left to (-1,0), (-2,0), then up to (-2,1), (-2,2), (-2,3). But are there walls blocking this path?

At (-2,0): is there a wall? Looking at the list, the closest walls are at (1,4), (4,4), (3,3), etc. So maybe there's no wall at (-2,0). Similarly, moving up from (-2,0) to (-2,3) would pass through (-2,1), (-2,2), (-2,3). Are there walls there? The walls listed are at (4,4), (3,3), (1,3), (1,2), etc. So (-2,3) is where the `stop` block is, but not a wall. So the path should be clear.

Once the player reaches (-2,3), they can move the `stop` block. Since the `stop` block is a text block, and the rule ""wall is stop"" makes walls stop, but the `stop` block itself is not a wall unless defined. Since it's a text block, maybe it's movable. So the player can pick up the `stop` block and move it somewhere else, like to the ground (e.g., position (0,0)), breaking the ""wall is stop"" rule.

Once that's done, the walls are no longer stop, and the player can walk through them. Then, the player can navigate to the key at (5,1). The path would involve going right past the walls, which are now passable.

Alternatively, after removing the stop rule, the player can go around the walls more easily.

So the sequence of actions would be:

1. Move to the `stop` block at (-2,3).

2. Pick up the `stop` block and move it away, say to (0,0).

3. Now, walls are not stop, so the player can walk through them.

4. Move right past the walls to the key at (5,1).

But how to execute this in the game? The player needs to navigate to the `stop` block, which is two steps left and three steps up from their current position. Then, move the `stop` block. Assuming the player can move left and up, and interact with the text blocks.

Another thing to consider: when moving the `stop` block, the player might need to be adjacent to it. So from the player's position (assuming they start at (0,0)), moving left two steps to (-2,0), then up three steps to (-2,3), where the `stop` block is. Then, move the `stop` block. For example, move it down to (-2,2), breaking the rule.

Once the `stop` rule is broken, walls are passable. Then, the player can go right to the key.

Alternatively, after breaking the stop rule, the player can go around the walls to the key's location.

So the final action would be to move right towards the key once the walls are no longer stop.

But the question is, what's the immediate next action the player should take based on the current observation? The latest observation shows the player is still trying to get past the walls, but previous attempts failed because the action wasn't valid. Maybe the assistant needs to figure out the correct sequence of moves.

In the last observation, the player is trying to move right multiple times, but perhaps they are blocked by walls. So the correct action would be to move in a different direction, maybe down to avoid the walls, or find a way to manipulate the rules first.

Alternatively, if the player can reach the `door` and make it the win condition, that might be a quicker path. The door is at (4,2). If the player can create ""door is win"", then stepping on the door would win. To do that, they need to move the `win` block to the door's position.

The `win` block is at (6,4). To get there, the player needs to move right six steps and down four steps. But that path is blocked by walls. Alternatively, move the `win` block by picking it up and carrying it to the door.

But to pick up the `win` block, the player must be adjacent to it. The `win` block is at (6,4), which is six steps right and four steps up from the player's assumed position (0,0). That's a long way, and the path is blocked by walls.

So perhaps the best immediate action is to move towards the `stop` block to break the rule. The player needs to move left and up. For example, first move left once, then up three times, then move the `stop` block.

But the previous actions of moving right multiple times didn't work because the player was stuck behind walls. So the correct action now would be to move left to start navigating towards the `stop` block.

So the next valid action should be to move left.

Let's tackle this Baba Is You puzzle. The active rules are ""key is win"", ""wall is stop"", and ""baba is you"". The goal is usually to reach the WIN object, which is currently the key. But since ""key is win"", that means touching the key makes the player win. So I need to get to the key.

Looking at the map, I see the key is at 5 steps to the right and 4 steps up. Wait, no, the key's position is listed as ""key 6 steps to the right and 1 step up"" in the latest observation. Wait, no, the current observation shows the key at 6 steps to the right and 1 step up. Let me check again.

In the current observation, the objects are:

- wall 2 steps right and 4 up
- rule `key` 5 right, 4 up
- rule `is` 6 right,4 up
- rule `win`7 right,4 up
- rule `wall` left 3, up3
- etc.
- key is at 6 steps to the right and 1 step up.

So the key is down near the bottom. The player (Baba) is at rule `baba` 3 step left and 2 steps down. So Baba's position is 3 steps left and 2 steps down from the reference point. Let me visualize the grid.

The key is at (6 right, 1 up), so maybe directly below the wall structure. The path to the key might be blocked by walls labeled as STOP. The player needs to move around these walls. But since ""baba is you"", the player can move freely unless there's a STOP property. The walls are defined as STOP, so the player can't move into them.

Looking at the objects around the player's position (rule `baba` is 3 left and 2 down from where?), maybe the player is in a position to move right. Let's see:

The player is at rule `baba` 3 step to the left and 2 steps down. So if the reference point is, say, the top-left corner, the player is somewhere in the lower-left area. To reach the key at 6 right and 1 up, the player needs to move right and up.

But there are walls in the way. For example, at 4 steps right and 2 up there's a rule `door`, and walls at various positions. Let's check the path.

If the player moves right from their current position (3 left, 2 down), but wait, the player's position is relative. Maybe I should map out the coordinates.

Assuming the player's position is where the ""rule baba"" is located: 3 steps to the left and 2 steps down. So coordinates might be (0,0) for the reference point, and the player is at (-3, -2). The key is at (6, 1). The walls are at various positions, like (4,4), (2,3), etc.

So the player needs to go from (-3, -2) to (6,1). The path might require moving right and up, but avoiding walls. Let's see:

Possible path: Right to (0, -2), then up to (0,0), then right to (6,0), then up to (6,1). But check if there are walls along the way.

Looking at the objects:

- At (4,4) there's a wall.
- At (2,3) a wall.
- At (1,3) a wall.
- At (1,2) a wall.
- At (4,2) a rule door.
- At (6,1) the key.

So moving right from (-3,-2) to (0,-2) is possible if there's no wall. Then up to (0,0). Check if there's a wall at (0,0). According to the objects, the walls are at (4,4), (2,3), (1,3), (1,2), (4,2), etc. So (0,0) seems clear. Then move right to (6,0). Along the way from (0,0) to (6,0), check for walls. There's a wall at (4,2), which is two steps up from (4,0), so that's not in the way. Then at (6,0), can the player move up to (6,1) where the key is?

But between (6,0) and (6,1), there's the key and a wall at (4,1). Wait, no, looking at the objects:

- wall 2 steps to the right and 1 step up: So coordinate (2,1) is a wall.
- wall 4 steps to the right and 1 step up: (4,1) is a wall.
- key at (6,1).

So from (6,0) to (6,1), the player would move into (6,1), which is the key. Since ""key is win"", touching it wins. But is there a wall blocking that move? The wall at (4,1) is two steps left, so not in the way. So the path should be possible.

But how to get to (6,0)? From (0,0), moving right 6 steps. Are there walls along the way? The walls at (2,3), (1,3), etc., are higher up. The walls at (4,2) and others are also not in the direct path. So moving right from (0,0) to (6,0) should be clear.

But how does the player get to (0,0) in the first place? The player's starting position is at (-3, -2). So moving right 3 steps to reach (0,-2), then up 2 steps to (0,0). Along the way, check for walls. From (-3,-2) to (0,-2): moving right through ( -2,-2), (-1,-2), (0,-2). Are there any walls here? Looking at the objects, the walls are at (4,4), (2,3), (1,3), (1,2), (4,2), (2,1), (4,1). So the path from (-3,-2) to (0,-2) is clear of walls. Then up to (0,0): moving north, check if (0,-1) or (0,0) has a wall. According to the objects, there's a wall at (2,1), but that's east of (0,0). So moving up from (0,-2) to (0,-1) then to (0,0) should be possible.

Once at (0,0), move right to (6,0), then up to (6,1) to get the key. But how to move right from (0,0) to (6,0)? The player needs to move right six steps. Are there any walls between (0,0) and (6,0)? The only walls nearby are at (2,1), (4,1), and (4,2), which are not in the same row. So the path should be clear.

But how to execute this movement step by step. The problem is that in each step, the player can only move one step in a direction. So the first step should be to move right from the initial position to start moving towards (0,-2).

Wait, the player's initial position is where the ""rule baba"" is located: 3 steps to the left and 2 steps down. So if the reference point is, say, the top-left corner, the player is at ( -3, -2 ). To move right, they would go to ( -2, -2 ), then ( -1, -2 ), then ( 0, -2 ), and so on.

So the first action should be to move right. But maybe there's a closer way. Let's check the immediate surroundings.

Looking at the current observation, the player is at rule `baba` 3 step to the left and 2 steps down. The objects nearby might include the ""stop"" rule at 1 step to the left and 3 step up, but that's probably not in the immediate vicinity.

Alternatively, maybe there's a text block nearby that can be moved to change the rules. For example, if the player can move the ""key is win"" rule to make something else the win condition, but the current rule is ""key is win"", so touching the key wins.

Alternatively, maybe the player needs to push a rule to change the game. For example, if there's a ""door"" rule, maybe moving it somewhere. But the door is at 5 steps right and 2 steps up. Not sure.

Another approach: Since the key is the win condition, the player needs to reach it. The path is clear if no walls block, but the player must navigate around the walls. Let's see the positions of the walls again:

- wall at (4,4)
- wall at (2,3)
- wall at (1,3)
- wall at (1,2)
- wall at (4,2)
- wall at (2,1)
- wall at (4,1)
- others are further down.

So the player's path from (-3,-2) to (6,1) is mostly open, except maybe some obstacles. Let's outline the steps:

1. Move right three times to reach (0,-2).
2. Move up two times to reach (0,0).
3. Move right six times to reach (6,0).
4. Move up once to reach (6,1) and win.

But each move must be valid. Let's verify each step.

Step 1: Moving right from (-3,-2) to (0,-2). No walls in between. Valid.

Step 2: Moving up from (0,-2) to (0,-1), then to (0,0). No walls at (0,-1) or (0,0). Valid.

Step 3: Moving right from (0,0) to (6,0). Check for walls between (0,0) and (6,0). The walls at (2,1) and (4,1) are one step above, so not in the way. So moving right is possible. Valid.

Step 4: Move up from (6,0) to (6,1). The key is there, and since ""key is win"", touching it wins. Valid.

Therefore, the optimal action is to move right to start heading towards the key. But the first action should be the initial move right from the starting position. So the chosen action is ""right"".

Let's try to figure out how to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. The goal is usually to reach the WIN object, which is currently set to the KEY. So, I need to get to the key. But the path is blocked by walls which are STOP, meaning I can't move through them. Also, I need to consider the rules.

First, let me look at the active rules. The main ones are ""key is win"", ""wall is stop"", and ""baba is you"". Since Baba is You, I can move around as Baba. But the walls are stop, so I can't push them unless they have another rule. Wait, but the key is the win condition, so if I can get to the key, that should win the level. 

Looking at the objects on the map, the key is at 5 steps to the right and 1 step up from my current position. But there are walls blocking the path. Let me visualize the layout.

From the observation, the player (Baba) is probably at the position where the ""rule `baba`"" is located. The ""rule `baba`"" is 4 steps to the left and 2 steps down from the key's position. Wait, maybe I need to check the exact positions.

Wait, the objects list shows the key at 5 steps right and 1 step up. The wall is directly above that at 1 step right and 1 step up. So the path to the key is blocked by a wall. Also, there's a door at 4 steps right and 2 steps up, which might be a way through if I can change the door's rule.

But how can I get past the wall? The walls are STOP, meaning I can't move into them. Unless I can change the rule of the wall to something else. For example, if I can make the wall not be STOP, then I could walk through it. Or maybe make myself able to walk through walls by redefining STOP.

Looking at the available text blocks, there's a ""rule `wall`"" at 4 steps left and 3 steps up. So that rule defines wall as stop. If I can move that text block away or replace it, maybe I can change the wall's property.

But to move the text blocks, I need to be adjacent to them and not be blocked by STOP. Let's see. The ""rule `wall`"" is at 4 left and 3 up from the key. My current position is where the ""rule `baba`"" is, which is 4 steps left and 2 steps down from the key. So from my position, to reach the ""rule `wall`"", I need to move right 4 steps and up 1 step. But there are walls blocking the way. For example, the wall at 1 step right and 3 step up is in the way. So I can't get to the ""rule `wall`"" directly.

Alternatively, maybe there's another way. The key is win, so if I can pick up the key, but since key is win, maybe just reaching it is enough. But the problem is the path is blocked. Let me check if there's a door that can be opened. The door is at 4 steps right and 2 steps up. The rule for the door is ""door"" without any property, so unless there's a rule like ""door is key"" or similar, I can't open it. But in the active rules, I don't see any that affect the door. So maybe the door is a dead end.

Another idea: Maybe I can make the wall not a stop by redefining it. For example, if I can create a rule that says ""stop is ..."" something else, then walls would no longer be stop. But how? The existing rules are ""key is win"", ""wall is stop"", and ""baba is you"". If I can move one of these rules, I could change the definitions.

Looking at the text blocks on the map, there are multiple ""is"" rules. For example, the ""rule `key`"" is at 6 right, 4 up, paired with ""rule `is`"" at 7 right, 4 up. So ""key is win"" is formed by those two blocks. Similarly, ""wall is stop"" is made by the ""rule `wall`"" at 2 left, 3 up and ""rule `is`"" at 1 left, 3 up. And ""baba is you"" is from ""rule `baba`"" at 2 left, 2 down and ""rule `is`"" at 1 left, 2 down, then ""rule `you`"" at 2 down.

So, to change a rule, I need to move the ""is"" blocks. For example, if I can take an ""is"" block and attach it to a different subject and property, I can create a new rule. But I need to be able to move the text blocks. Baba is you, so I can move, but I can only move objects that are not STOP. The walls are STOP, so I can't push them. However, text blocks might not be considered STOP unless they are part of a rule that makes them so. Wait, the STOP property is applied to objects like walls, not to text blocks. So maybe I can move the text blocks.

Looking at the objects, there's a ""rule `is`"" at 8 right, 4 up (part of ""key is win""), another ""rule `is`"" at 3 step up (part of ""wall is stop""), and others. If I can grab an ""is"" block and combine it with another subject, I can change a rule.

For example, if I take the ""rule `is`"" at 7 steps right and 4 up (which is part of ""key is win"") and move it next to the ""rule `wall`"" at 2 left and 3 up, maybe I can create a new rule like ""wall is key"", making walls not stop. But I need to be able to move the ""is"" block there.

But how do I move the ""is"" block? Since I'm Baba, and the text blocks are likely movable unless they're part of a STOP object. The walls are STOP, but the text blocks themselves might not be. So I can move the text blocks by stepping on them and moving in direction, as long as they're not blocked by STOP.

So the plan could be:

1. Move to the ""rule `is`"" block that's part of ""key is win"" (at 7 right, 4 up).
2. Carry that ""is"" block and move it to the vicinity of the ""rule `wall`"" at 2 left, 3 up.
3. Combine them to create a new rule, like ""wall is key"", which would make walls not stop.
4. Then, walk through the walls to reach the key.

Alternatively, create a rule that makes ""STOP"" something else, like ""STOP is NOTHING"", which would remove the stop property from walls.

But to do that, I need to find the ""rule `stop`"" which is at 1 step left and 3 up. If I can move that ""rule `stop`"" away or change it, but that might be more complex.

Another approach: Since the key is win, maybe I don't need to path through walls. Maybe I can redefine ""win"" to be something else that's reachable. For example, if I can make ""ball is win"", then go get the ball. But the ball is at 2 steps right and 3 steps up, which might be blocked by walls.

Alternatively, maybe combine ""baba"" with ""win"" using an ""is"" block. If I can make ""baba is win"", then just touching the key (since key is win) or being Baba would make me win. But I think the active rule is ""key is win"", so you need to touch the key.

Wait, the active rules are ""key is win"", so reaching the key makes you win. So I need to get to the key at 5 right, 1 up.

The path is blocked by a wall at 1 right, 1 up. So I need to remove that wall's stop property.

To do that, I can try to redefine the wall's rule. The current rule for wall is ""wall is stop"", formed by the ""rule `wall`"" at 4 left, 3 up and ""rule `is`"" at 3 left, 3 up. If I can move the ""rule `is`"" from that position to another subject, I can break the ""wall is stop"" rule.

For example, take the ""rule `is`"" at 3 left, 3 up (part of ""wall is stop"") and move it next to ""rule `baba`"" to create ""baba is stop"", which would make Baba a stop, but that's bad because then I can't move. Alternatively, move it to create ""baba is win"", which would make me win immediately, but I'm already Baba, so if ""baba is win"", touching anything would win, but I don't think that's the case. The active rule is ""key is win"", so even if I make ""baba is win"", I think I still need to touch the key. Or maybe not. Need to check the game mechanics.

Alternatively, take the ""rule `is`"" from the ""key is win"" (at 7 right, 4 up) and attach it to ""wall"" to make ""wall is win"", but that would make walls win, which might not help. Or attach it to ""stop"" to make ""stop is win"", but not sure.

Alternatively, take the ""rule `stop`"" which is at 1 left, 3 up, and move it somewhere else. If I can remove the ""stop"" property from walls, then they become passable.

But to move the ""rule `stop`"", I need to be adjacent to it. The ""rule `stop`"" is at 1 left, 3 up. My current position is where the ""rule `baba`"" is, which is 4 left, 2 down from the key. So from my position, moving up and left might be possible.

Wait, the objects list shows the ""rule `baba`"" at 4 step to the left and 2 steps down from where? Probably from the key's position. So the key is at 5 right, 1 up. So the ""rule `baba`"" is at 5 right -4 left = 1 right, and 1 up +2 down = -1 down? Maybe I'm getting confused with the coordinates.

Alternatively, perhaps the coordinates are relative to the player's position. The observation says ""Objects on the map"" with positions relative to the player. For example, ""wall 3 steps to the right and 4 step up"" means that wall is 3 steps right and 4 up from the player's current position.

So the player is at position (0,0). The key is at (5, 1). The wall blocking the path is at (1,1). The ""rule `wall`"" that defines wall as stop is at (-4, 3) (since it's 4 steps to the left and 3 up from the player). The ""rule `is`"" for that wall is at (-3, 3). The ""rule `stop`"" is at (-1, 3).

To reach the key at (5,1), the player needs to go right 5 and down 1, but the path is blocked by a wall at (1,1). So how to get past that wall?

Option 1: Remove the ""stop"" property from walls. To do that, the rule ""wall is stop"" needs to be broken. The components are ""rule `wall`"" at (-4,3) and ""rule `is`"" at (-3,3). If I can move either of these, I can break the rule.

The ""rule `is`"" at (-3,3) is part of the ""wall is stop"" rule. If I can move this ""is"" block to another subject, like attaching it to ""baba"", making ""baba is stop"", which would make me stop, but that's bad. Alternatively, attach it to ""key"" to make ""key is stop"", but the key is win, so that would block me from winning.

Alternatively, take the ""rule `is`"" from the ""key is win"" rule, which is at (7,4) relative to the player. So that's 7 steps right and 4 up from the player. If I can move that ""is"" block and attach it to the ""rule `wall`"" at (-4,3), creating ""wall is key"", then walls would be key, which might not help, but perhaps then I can move through walls since they are key? Not sure.

Alternatively, take the ""rule `is`"" from the ""key is win"" and attach it to ""stop"", making ""stop is key"". Then, any object that is stop would be key, but I'm not sure how that helps.

Another approach: Create a new rule that makes ""YOU"" something else. The current ""you"" is defined by ""rule `you`"" at (2,2) relative to the player (since it's 2 step left and 2 steps down from the key's position, which is at (5,1), so 5-2=3, 1-2=-1, but maybe coordinates are different). Wait, the ""rule `you`"" is at ""2 step to the left and 2 steps down"" from where? The observation lists it as part of the objects, so probably relative to the player's position. So ""rule `you`"" is at (-2, -2). If I can attach this ""you"" to another subject, like ""baba"", making ""baba is you"", but that's already the case. Because the active rule is ""baba is you"".

Alternatively, make ""key is you"", so touching the key makes you you, which is redundant, but perhaps allows you to move it? Not sure.

Alternatively, since the key is win, maybe I can push the key if it's not stop. But the key's rule is ""key is win"", not ""key is push"" or anything. So unless there's a rule that allows pushing, I can't push it.

Wait, in Baba Is You, by default, objects can be pushed unless they are defined as ""stop"". So if I can remove the ""stop"" property from walls, I can walk through them. So the main goal is to redefine ""wall is stop"" to something else.

To do that, I need to move either the ""rule `wall`"" or the ""rule `is`"" that's part of ""wall is stop"". Let's focus on the ""rule `is`"" at (-3,3) which is part of ""wall is stop"". If I can move that ""is"" block and attach it to another subject, like ""baba"", making ""baba is stop"", which would make me stop, but that's bad. Alternatively, attach it to ""stop"" to make ""stop is ..."", but I need a property.

Alternatively, take the ""rule `is`"" from the ""key is win"" (at (7,4)) and move it to the ""rule `wall`"" at (-4,3), creating ""wall is win"". Then walls would be win, but I need to touch the key, which is already win. Not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, take the ""rule `is`"" from ""key is win"" and combine it with ""rule `stop`"" to make ""stop is win"". Then stops would be win, but I need to touch a stop object, which are the walls. That might not help.

Another Idea: The ""rule `door`"" is at (4,2). There's no rule defining door's behavior, so it's just a door. Maybe if I can create a rule like ""door is key"", then using the key on the door would open it. But how to do that? I need to move the ""is"" block next to ""door"" and ""key"". The key is at (5,1), and the door is at (4,2). If I can move the ""key"" rule components to the door, but the key is part of ""key is win"".

Alternatively, take the ""rule `is`"" from ""key is win"" (at (7,4)) and attach it to ""door"" and ""key"" to make ""door is key"". But the key is already at (5,1), and the door is at (4,2). If I can create ""door is key"", then maybe stepping on the door would require the key, but I'm not sure.

This is getting complicated. Maybe the simplest way is to try to reach the ""rule `is`"" that's part of ""wall is stop"" and move it away. But to do that, I need to move to its position.

From the player's position (assuming they are at (0,0)), the ""rule `is`"" for wall is stop is at (-3,3). To get there, I need to move left 3 and up 3. But the path is blocked by walls. For example, at (1,1) there's a wall. So moving left 3 and up 3 would require moving through (1,1), which is a wall (STOP). Since I can't move through STOP objects, I can't get there.

Alternative Path: Maybe there's a way to use the ""rule `baba`"" to create a new rule. For example, if I can make ""baba is push"", then I could push walls. But there's no ""push"" rule currently. However, the ""baba is you"" rule allows me to move, but not push unless there's a rule allowing it.

Wait, in Baba Is You, by default, you can push objects that are not STOP. Since walls are STOP, you can't push them. But if I can remove the STOP property from walls, then they become pushable. So again, the goal is to redefine ""wall is stop"".

Another approach: Use the existing ""is"" blocks to create a new rule that negates STOP. For example, create ""stop is lose"", but I don't see a ""lose"" rule. Or ""stop is..."", but I need a property.

Alternatively, create ""baba is stop"", which would make me stop, but that's bad. So avoid that.

Wait, maybe I can create a rule that says ""stop is win"". Then, stepping on a stop object (which is a wall) would make me win. But the active rule is ""key is win"", so I need to touch the key. However, if I redefine ""stop is win"", then touching a wall would also win. But that's a gamble. Let's see.

To do that, I need to take the ""rule `is`"" block and attach it to ""stop"" and ""win"". The ""win"" is already defined by the key. The ""","

Let's try to figure out how to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. The goal is usually to reach the WIN object, but here the active rule says ""key is win,"" so I need to get to the key. But the key is right next to a wall that's marked as STOP. So moving directly towards the key is blocked by the wall. Plus, the walls are STOP, meaning I can't push them unless they're not STOP. But the rules are fixed unless I can move them.

Looking at the objects, there's a rule `wall` on the left and some other rules. The `baba is you` rule means I can move as Baba. The key is at 5 steps to the right and 1 step up. The door is at 4 steps right and 2 steps up. Maybe the door is a way out once I have the key? But the key is the win condition here.

Wait, the active rules are key is win, so touching the key should make me win. But the key is behind a wall that's STOP. How do I get past the wall? Maybe I can change the rules. The rules are made of text blocks. For example, the ""wall is stop"" rule is formed by the text blocks 'wall', 'is', 'stop'. If I can rearrange these text blocks to change the rules, maybe I can make the wall not stop.

Looking at the objects, there are several rule text blocks. The 'key is win' rule is on the top right. The 'wall is stop' rule is on the left at 3 steps up. There's also a 'stop' rule at 1 step left and 3 steps up. If I can move the 'stop' property from 'wall' to something else, then maybe the wall isn't stop anymore. But to do that, I need to move the text blocks.

Baba is me, so I can move around. Let me check where I am. The user hasn't specified my position, but perhaps the 'rule `baba`' is at 4 steps left and 2 steps down. So I need to move to that position first to manipulate the rules. Wait, the 'rule `baba`' is 4 steps left and 2 steps down from the reference point. But the exact position might require knowing where I'm standing. Maybe I'm initially at the position of 'rule `baba`', which is 4 steps left and 2 steps down. So to get there, I need to move left and down.

Once I reach the 'baba' rule, I can potentially move the 'baba', 'is', and 'you' text blocks to create a new rule. For example, making 'baba is stop' would make me stop, which is bad. But maybe making 'key is you' so that the key becomes me, allowing me to move it. But the key is an object, not a subject. Wait, the rules are [Subject] IS [Property]. So to make the key a 'you', I need to create a 'key is you' rule. But the existing 'you' rule is part of 'baba is you'. If I can separate those text blocks.

Looking at the objects, there's a 'rule `you`' at 2 steps left and 2 steps down. So if I can move the 'you' text block and combine it with 'key' and 'is', that could work. So the steps would be: move to the 'key' location, then move the 'is' and 'you' text blocks next to 'key' to form 'key is you', making the key become me. Then I can pick up the key and move it past the wall.

But moving the text blocks requires that they are not STOP. The 'wall is stop' rule means that any object named 'wall' has the stop property. Are the text blocks considered separate objects? I think in Baba Is You, text blocks can be moved if they're not part of a rule that makes them stop. Since the 'wall' rule is 'wall is stop', but the text blocks 'wall', 'is', 'stop' themselves might not be walls. So maybe I can move them.

So first, I need to locate the text blocks. The 'key is win' rule is at 6,7,8 steps right and 4 up. The 'wall is stop' rule is at 4 left and 3 up, with 'is' at 3 left and 3 up, and 'stop' at 2 left and 3 up. The 'you' rule is at 2 left and 2 down, with 'baba' and 'is' nearby.

To create 'key is you', I need to move the 'you' text block next to 'key' and 'is'. The 'you' is currently at 2 left and 2 down. To get there, I need to move left and down from my current position. Assuming I'm at the 'rule `baba`' position (4 left, 2 down), moving left again would take me further left, but the 'you' is at 2 left and 2 down, which is two steps left from the 'baba' rule. So moving left twice would get me there. Then pick up the 'you' text block and move it to the key's location.

But wait, the path might be blocked. There are walls at 3 steps right in various positions. Maybe I need to reposition myself between the text blocks. Alternatively, maybe I can rearrange the existing rules. For example, breaking the 'wall is stop' rule by moving 'stop' to another subject, like 'key is stop', but that would block the key. Not helpful.

Another approach: since 'key is win', touching the key wins. But it's behind a stop wall. If I can make the wall not stop, then I can pass through. To do that, I need to change the 'wall is stop' rule. If I can move the 'stop' property from 'wall' to something else. For example, making 'door is stop' would allow me to go through the wall, but the door is at 4 right, 2 up. Not sure.

Alternatively, create a 'wall is you' rule. If I make the wall a 'you', then I can push it or move it. But how? To create 'wall is you', I need the text blocks 'wall', 'is', 'you'. The 'you' is available at 2 left, 2 down. So if I can move 'wall' (the subject) next to 'is' and 'you', but the 'wall' text block is part of the existing 'wall is stop' rule. To move it, I need to break that rule. Maybe by moving the 'is' or 'stop' away.

This is getting complicated. Let me try to outline the steps:

1. Move to the location of the 'key' to get it, but it's behind a wall.
2. Instead, create a 'key is you' rule to become the key.
3. To do that, gather the 'key', 'is', and 'you' text blocks.
4. The 'key' is at 5 right, 4 up. The 'is' is at 6 right, 4 up. The 'you' is at 2 left, 2 down.
5. Need to navigate to these positions, moving around walls.
6. Alternatively, break the existing 'wall is stop' rule to allow moving through walls.

Alternatively, since the door is at 4 right, 2 up, which is a rule 'door', maybe creating 'door is win' would let me win by touching the door. But the active rule is 'key is win', so that might not work. Unless I can change the active rules.

But the priority of rules matters. The latest rule might override. For example, if I make 'door is win', then touching the door would win. But the 'key is win' is still active unless removed.

This is tricky. Let's focus on creating 'key is you'. If I can place 'key is you', then touching the key would make me a you, but wait, 'key is you' means the key is a you, so I can move it? Or does it mean that I, being you (Baba), can now act on the key as a you?

I think in Baba Is You, if an object is defined as 'you', then you can move it. So if I make 'key is you', then I can pick up the key and move it past the wall. Then, since 'key is win', moving the key (which is now a you) would mean I can move it, and when I place it somewhere, maybe it counts as winning.

But the key's location is at 5 right, 1 up. To get there, I need to move right and down. But the path is blocked by walls. If I can make the walls not stop, then I can pass through. Alternatively, push the walls if they're movable.

Wait, walls are stop, so I can't push them. Unless the rule 'wall is stop' is changed. For example, if I make 'wall is push', then I could push them. But how?

Alternatively, create a 'you' rule for the wall, making it movable. But that requires rearranging the text blocks.

This is taking too long. Let me try to plan specific steps:

1. Current position: Assuming I'm at the 'baba' rule location (4 left, 2 down).
2. Need to reach the 'you' text block at 2 left, 2 down. From here, moving left twice (to 2 left, 2 down) to get to 'you'.
3. Once I have 'you', move to the 'key' location (5 right, 4 up). But the path might be blocked by walls. Maybe need to go around.
4. Once at the key, place 'is' and 'you' next to it to make 'key is you'.
5. Then, as the key is now a you, I can pick it up and move it past the wall at 3 right, 4 up.
6. Since the key is win, moving it anywhere should make me win.

But how to navigate? Let's see the map layout:

- The top right has the 'key is win' rule.
- The middle has a ball and walls.
- The lower part has the 'baba' rule and 'you' rule.

Maybe the best path is to move left to get the 'you' block, then right to get the 'key' and 'is' blocks.

Alternatively, since the 'is' is adjacent to the 'key' rule, maybe I can move the 'you' block there.

Another angle: The existing 'baba is you' rule means I can move. The 'key is win' means touching the key wins. The wall is stop, so I can't go through it. But if I can make the wall not stop, then I can go around.

To make the wall not stop, I need to change the 'wall is stop' rule. For example, making 'wall is push' or removing the 'stop' property from wall.

To do that, I can take the 'stop' text block and move it to another subject. For example, 'key is stop', which would block the key, but that's worse. Or 'door is stop', but the door is at 4 right, 2 up. Not sure.

Alternatively, delete the 'wall is stop' rule by moving the 'stop' block away. If I can move the 'stop' text block from the 'wall is stop' rule, then the rule is broken, and walls are no longer stop.

The 'stop' block is at 2 left, 3 up. So if I move it to another location, like next to 'key', making 'key is stop', but that would block the key. Not helpful.

Alternatively, move 'stop' to create a new rule that doesn't affect walls. Like 'ball is stop', but the ball is at 2 right, 3 up. That would block the ball, but I don't know if that helps.

This seems complicated. Maybe the better approach is to create 'key is you' to become the key. Let's try that.

Steps:

1. Move to the 'you' rule at 2 left, 2 down. From the 'baba' rule position (4 left, 2 down), move left twice (actions: left, left).
2. Pick up the 'you' text block and move it to the 'key' location (5 right, 4 up). But the path might be blocked. Need to navigate around.
3. Once at the key's position, place the 'you' next to 'key' and 'is' to form 'key is you'.

But how to move the blocks? Each move can be in a direction, and if the target is a text block, I can push it if it's not stop. Wait, the 'wall is stop', but text blocks themselves might not be walls unless they're part of a rule that makes them so. So the text blocks 'wall', 'is', 'stop' are separate objects. Since they're not part of a 'stop' rule unless they're in a rule that makes them so. For example, if the rule is 'text is stop', then the text block 'text' would be stop. But here, the 'wall' text block is part of the 'wall is stop' rule, making the wall (object) stop, but the 'wall' text block itself is not a stop object. So I can move the 'wall' text block.

So, to break the 'wall is stop' rule, I can move the 'wall' text block away. For example, move it to the left, making the rule ' is stop' which is invalid. Or move 'is' or 'stop' away.

Alternatively, create a new rule that overrides 'wall is stop'. For example, 'baba is stop' would make me stop, which is bad. Not helpful.

Back to the original idea: create 'key is you'.

Assuming I can gather the 'key', 'is', and 'you' text blocks:

- 'key' is at 5 right, 4 up.
- 'is' is at 6 right, 4 up.
- 'you' is at 2 left, 2 down.

To get these together:

1. Move from my current position (baba rule at 4 left, 2 down) to the 'you' location (2 left, 2 down): left, left.
2. Pick up 'you' and move it towards the key's area. To reach the key, need to move right and up, but there are walls. Let's see:

The path from 'you' at 2 left, 2 down to 'key' at 5 right, 4 up would require moving right 7 steps and up 2 steps. But there are walls at 3 right in various positions. For example, at 3 right, 4 up is a wall. At 3 right, 3 up is a wall, etc. So moving directly right and up might be blocked.

Alternative route: Move right past the walls. Since walls are stop, I can't pass through them, but maybe I can move around them by going in another direction.

Alternatively, use the door at 4 right, 2 up. If I can make the door not stop, then I can use it. But how?

This is getting too complex. Let's try to focus on one possible action.

Given the latest observation, the active rules are still key is win, wall is stop, baba is you. The objects are positioned as before. The agent's previous attempts resulted in defaulting to idle, probably because the chosen actions weren't valid.

Looking at the possible actions, the agent needs to choose from idle, up, right, down, left. Based on the current position, if the agent is near the 'baba' rule, moving left might take it closer to the 'you' text block. Alternatively, moving right could head towards the key.

But without knowing the agent's exact position, it's hard to say. Maybe the agent is stuck near the wall and needs to move in a direction that's allowed.

Alternatively, the solution is to move the 'win' property from 'key' to another object, like 'baba', making touching Baba win. But the active rule is 'key is win', so that's the current win condition.

Wait, another thought: If I can make 'baba is win', then just touching Baba would make me win. But how? The existing rule is 'key is win'. To change that, I need to rearrange the text blocks of the 'key is win' rule. For example, move 'win' to 'baba', making 'baba is win'.

The 'win' text block is at 8 right, 4 up. So if I can move 'win' from the 'key is win' rule to 'baba', that would work. But to do that, I need to break the existing rule and create a new one.

The steps would be:

1. Move to the 'key is win' rule location (6,7,8 right,4 up).
2. Move the 'win' block to adjacent 'baba' and 'is' blocks.

The 'baba' rule is at 4 left, 2 down. So from the 'key' area, moving left and down would be necessary. But there are walls in the way. For example, at 3 right, 4 up is a wall. So moving left from 6 right to 5 right, but there's a wall at 3 right, 4 up. Wait, no, the walls are at 3 steps right in various positions, but the 'key is win' rule is at 6,7,8 right,4 up. So moving left from there would be safer.

This is quite involved. Given the time constraints, perhaps the best immediate action is to move towards the 'you' text block to create the 'key is you' rule. So the chosen action would be to move left twice to reach 'you', then move right to get the 'key' and 'is' blocks. But how to express this in a single action?

Since the agent can only choose one action at a time, the first step is to move left to get closer to the 'you' block. The previous actions were 'left' and 'right', but maybe the agent needs to keep moving left to reach the 'you' block.

In the latest observation, after moving left, the agent's position might have changed. Assuming the agent is now at 3 left, 2 down (after moving left once from 4 left), then moving left again would get to 2 left, 2 down where the 'you' block is. So the action should be 'left' again.

Let's take a look at the current observation. The active rules are still ""key is win"", ""wall is stop"", and ""baba is you"". So the goal is to get the key because key is win. But how do I get past these walls?

The objects on the map show that there's a key located at 6 steps to the right and 1 step up. But the path to it seems blocked by walls. There's a rule `door` at 5 steps to the right and 2 steps up. Maybe the door is a way through? But how do I open it? The key is probably needed for that door, since the key is the win condition. Wait, but the active rule says ""key is win"", so touching the key would make me win? Or does it mean I need to use the key to unlock something else?

Looking at the map, the key is below me, but there's a wall directly below where the key is. So I can't just move straight down. Maybe I need to move around the walls. Let me check the positions again.

The player (Baba) is at the position defined by the rule `baba` which is 3 steps to the left and 2 steps down from some reference point. Assuming the reference is the top-left corner, but the exact coordinates might be tricky. Alternatively, maybe I should focus on relative positions.

To reach the key at (6 right, 1 up), I need to move down from where I am. But there's a wall at 1 step up. Wait, the wall is at 2 steps to the right and 1 step up. So if I'm currently at 2 steps right, moving up would hit a wall. Hmm. Let me visualize the grid.

Current position (Baba's position) is 3 steps left and 2 steps down from the door rule? Not sure. Maybe I should focus on the key's location. The key is 5 steps right and 1 step up from the rule `key` block. Wait, the objects list shows the key is at 6 steps right and 1 step up. Maybe the coordinates are relative to some starting point.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is to the far right, and I need to navigate there. But there are walls blocking the path. The door is at 5 steps right and 2 steps up. If I can get past the walls to the door, maybe the door can be opened with the key. But how do I get past the walls?

Looking at the active rules, since ""wall is stop"", I can't move into walls. So I have to find a path around them. The key is at 6 right, 1 up. The path down to there is blocked by a wall at 2 right, 1 up. Maybe I can move left around the walls?

Wait, the player's current position is rule `baba` at 3 steps left and 2 steps down. If I move right, I can approach the wall at 2 steps right and 3 step up. Wait, the walls are scattered. Maybe moving right step by step, avoiding the walls.

But how do I reach the key? Let's see:

Current position: assume the player is at the position of the `baba` rule, which is 3 steps left and 2 steps down. So if I move right, I can get closer to the key. But the walls are at various positions. For example, there's a wall at 2 steps right and 1 step up. So if I move right once, I'm at 1 step right. Then maybe move up, but there's a wall at 1 step left and 3 step up. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the solution is to use the text blocks to change the rules. For example, if I can move the ""key is win"" rule to make something else the win condition, or change ""wall is stop"" to allow moving through walls. But how?

The key is at 6 right, 1 up. If I can get there, then since key is win, touching it would make me win. But the path is blocked. Let's see:

From the player's position (3 left, 2 down), moving right would be towards the key. But there's a wall at 2 steps right and 1 step up. So to get to the key at 6 right, 1 up, I need to navigate through the grid avoiding walls.

Possible path:

1. Move right until I'm at 2 steps right (avoiding the wall at 2 right, 3 up? Not sure).
2. Then move down to avoid walls.
3. Find a route to the key's location.

But the exact coordinates are tricky. Alternatively, maybe there's a door at 5 right, 2 up. If I can reach that door and use the key, maybe that opens a path. But how to open the door? Perhaps the door's rule is ""door is ..."", but the active rules don't mention door. The current rules are key is win, wall is stop, baba is you. So maybe the door is just a passage that requires the key to unlock, which would mean moving the key next to the door?

Alternatively, maybe the door is a win condition if I can open it, but the active rule says key is win. So perhaps the key needs to be used on the door. In Baba Is You, sometimes you push objects onto each other. So maybe I need to push the key towards the door's rule?

But the key is an object, and the door is a rule. To interact, I might need to be adjacent to both. So if I can move the key next to the door rule, then maybe the door becomes passable. But how?

Alternatively, the rule `door` is a static object. Maybe the door is only passable when the key is in a certain position. But without more rules, it's hard to say.

Another angle: since ""baba is you"", I can move as Baba. The goal is to get the key because key is win. So the action plan is to reach the key. The challenge is avoiding walls.

Looking at the map again, the key is at 6 right, 1 up. The path down to there is blocked by a wall at 2 right, 1 up. So maybe moving right past the wall?

Wait, the walls are at various positions. Let's list them:

- Wall at 3 right, 4 up
- Rule key at 6 right, 4 up
- Rule is at 7 right, 4 up
- Rule win at 8 right, 4 up
- Rule wall at 2 left, 3 up
- Rule is at 1 left, 3 up
- Rule stop at 3 up
- Wall at 3 right, 3 up
- Ball at 4 right, 3 up
- Wall at 3 right, 2 up
- Rule door at 5 right, 2 up
- Wall at 3 right, 1 up
- Key at 6 right, 1 up
- Wall at 3 right
- Wall at 3 right, 1 down
- Rule baba at 2 left, 2 down
- Rule is at 1 left, 2 down
- Rule you at 2 down
- Wall at 3 right, 2 down

Assuming the player's position is at the rule `baba` which is 2 left and 2 down. So to move right, that's towards positive x-direction. The key is at 6 right, 1 up. So from the player's position (2 left, 2 down), moving right 4 steps to get to 2 right (since 2 left to 0 is center, then +4 right is 4 right). But along the way, there are walls.

For example, moving right from 2 left to 0 (center), then right to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. But at 3 right, 1 up there's a wall. So need to avoid that.

Alternatively, maybe move up first. From 2 down, moving up to 1, 2, 3, 4 steps up. But there's a wall at 3 up, and other walls.

This is getting complicated. Maybe the best approach is to move right towards the key, avoiding the walls. Let's see:

Current position: 2 left, 2 down (baba's rule).

Goal: 6 right, 1 up (key).

Possible path:

1. Move right to 1 left, 2 down.
2. Right to 0 (center), 2 down.
3. Right to 1 right, 2 down.
4. Check for walls. At 3 right, 2 down there's a wall, but that's further right. So moving to 1 right is safe.
5. Move up to 1 right, 1 down.
6. Then up to 1 right, 0 down (assuming down is negative).
7. Up to 1 right, 1 up.
8. Check for walls. At 3 right, 1 up there's a wall. So can't go straight up.
9. Maybe move right again to 2 right, 1 up. Is there a wall there? Looking at the objects, wall at 3 right, 1 up. So 2 right is clear.
10. Move to 2 right, 1 up.
11. Then move right to 3 right, 1 up (but there's a wall). Can't go there.
12. So instead, from 2 right, 1 up, move up to 2 right, 2 up.
13. Check if there's a wall. At 3 right, 2 up there's a wall. So maybe move left to 1 right, 2 up.
14. Then right again to 2 right, 2 up.
15. Continue up to 3 right, 2 up (wall). Hmm, this is not working.

Alternatively, maybe move down from the initial position. Let's try another path.

1. From 2 left, 2 down.
2. Move down to 2 left, 3 down. Is there a wall? The map shows walls at various positions, but not here.
3. Right to 1 left, 3 down.
4. Right to 0, 3 down.
5. Right to 1 right, 3 down.
6. Check for walls. At 3 right, 3 down there's a wall. So can't go past that.
7. Maybe move up from here to 1 right, 2 down.
8. Then up to 1 right, 1 down.
9. Up to 1 right, 0 down.
10. Up to 1 right, 1 up.
11. Now at 1 right, 1 up. Is there a wall? Yes, at 3 right, 1 up. So need to adjust.
12. Move left to 0 right, 1 up.
13. Then right to 1 right, 1 up (already there).
14. This isn't helping.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is reachable by moving around the blocks. Let's see:

The key is at 6 right, 1 up. To get there, maybe move right past the wall at 3 right, 1 up by going around it.

From the player's position, move right to 4 right, 2 down (assuming down is south). Wait, this is getting confusing with the coordinate system.

Alternatively, maybe the solution is to move the text blocks. For example, if I can change ""key is win"" to ""baba is win"", then touching Baba would make me win. But how to do that?

To move a text block, I need to be adjacent to it and not blocked by a stop property. The rule ""key is win"" is at 6 right, 4 up. The player is at 2 left, 2 down. The distance is quite far. Need to navigate there.

But there are walls in the way. For example, at 3 right, 3 up there's a wall. So moving up from the player's position would hit that wall.

Alternatively, find a path through the grid. Let's try to outline the map:

Starting from player's position (baba at 2 left, 2 down):

- To the right: 1 left, 2 down; 0, 2 down; 1 right, 2 down; 2 right, 2 down; 3 right, 2 down (wall).
- To the left: 3 left, 2 down; etc. But not helpful.

Looking up, from 2 left, 2 down:

- Up to 2 left, 1 down; 2 left, 0 down (center); 2 left, 1 up; 2 left, 2 up; 2 left, 3 up; 2 left, 4 up.

At 2 left, 4 up: there's a wall. So can't go further up that way.

Alternatively, move right and up. For example:

1. Move right to 1 left, 2 down.
2. Right to 0, 2 down.
3. Right to 1 right, 2 down.
4. Up to 1 right, 1 down.
5. Up to 1 right, 0 down.
6. Up to 1 right, 1 up.
7. Now at 1 right, 1 up. Is there a wall? Yes, at 3 right, 1 up. So can't go further right.
8. Move left to 0 right, 1 up.
9. Then right to 1 right, 1 up again. Not helpful.

This is frustrating. Maybe the solution is to move the ""key is win"" rule to make Baba the win condition. For example, if I can make ""baba is win"" by moving the ""you"" rule next to ""baba"".

The ""you"" rule is at 2 step to the left and 2 steps down from the player's position. Wait, the rule `you` is at 2 step to the left and 2 steps down from where? From the rule `baba` position, which is 2 left and 2 down. So the ""you"" rule is at (2 left - 2 step left) = 4 left and (2 down - 2 step down) = 4 down? Not sure. Maybe the coordinates are relative.

Alternatively, the ""you"" rule is at 2 step to the left and 2 steps down from the player's position. So if the player is at (0,0), then ""you"" is at (-2, -2). To move the ""you"" rule to be next to ""baba"", the player would need to move it there. But how?

The player needs to be adjacent to the ""you"" rule and then move it. Since ""baba is you"", the player can move text blocks that are not stop. The ""you"" rule is not stop, so it can be moved.

So the plan is:

1. Find the ""you"" rule's position. From the observation, rule `you` is at 2 step to the left and 2 steps down from rule `baba`. Rule `baba` is at 3 step to the left and 2 steps down from where? Maybe from the reference point, but assuming the player is at the `baba` rule's position, which is 3 step left and 2 step down from the starting point.

Alternatively, the exact positions are relative. The key is at 6 right, 4 up. The player needs to navigate there.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe the best immediate action is to move right towards the key, avoiding walls. The last valid action before failing was ""left"", but maybe now I should try moving right again.

Looking at the current observation, the player's position is rule `baba` at 3 step left and 2 step down. The key is at 6 right and 1 up. To get there, moving right and up.

But the wall at 3 right, 1 up is blocking the path. So maybe the solution is to move around that wall by going down first.

From the current position (3 left, 2 down), move right to 2 left, 2 down. Then right to 1 left, 2 down. Then right to 0, 2 down. Then up to 0, 1 down. Then up to 0, 0 down. Then up to 0, 1 up. Then right to 1 right, 1 up. Then right to 2 right, 1 up. Then up to 2 right, 2 up. Then right to 3 right, 2 up (wall). So stuck.

Alternatively, from 2 right, 1 up, move down to 2 right, 0 up. Then right to 3 right, 0 up. But there's a wall at 3 right, 0 up? Not sure. The map shows a wall at 3 right, 2 up and 1 step up, but not sure about 0 up.

This is really tricky. Maybe the intended solution is to move the ""key is win"" rule next to the key, but that seems redundant. Alternatively, make ""baba is win"" by moving the ""you"" rule to be next to ""baba"".

The ""you"" rule is at 1 step to the left and 2 steps down from the player's position (rule `you` is 1 step to the left and 2 steps down from rule `baba`). So if the player moves left twice and down once, they could reach the ""you"" rule.

For example:

1. From player's position (3 left, 2 down), move left to 4 left, 2 down.
2. Move left again to 5 left, 2 down.
3. Move down to 5 left, 3 down.
4. Now at the ""you"" rule's position (assuming it's there).
5. Move the ""you"" rule to be next to ""baba"".

But ""baba"" is at 3 left, 2 down. So moving the ""you"" rule to 2 left, 2 down (adjacent to ""baba"").

This would create the rule ""baba is you"", but since ""baba is you"" is already a rule, maybe it just reinforces it. Then, if the active rule is ""baba is you"" and another rule like ""baba is win"", but there's no such rule. The active rules are key is win, wall is stop, baba is you.

Wait, the active rules are still key is win. So changing ""baba is you"" won't make Baba the win condition unless there's a rule saying ""baba is win"". But there isn't. The current active rule is key is win, so touching the key wins.

So perhaps the correct approach is to reach the key. Given the grid, maybe the path requires moving around the walls by going up and then right.

Let's try to figure out what's going on here. The active rules are ""key is win"", ""wall is stop"", and ""baba is you"". So, the goal is to get the key because it's defined as win. But first, I need to see where the key is located.

Looking at the objects on the map, the key is 6 steps to the right and 1 step up from my current position. There's also a door at 5 steps to the right and 2 steps up. The walls are all around, marked as stop, so I can't move into them. 

The player (Baba) is at 3 steps to the left and 2 steps down from the top right corner, based on the rule `baba` being there. So, my current position is probably at the bottom left. 

To reach the key, I need to move right and up. But the path is blocked by walls. For example, 2 steps to the right and 1 step up is a wall. The door at 5 steps right and 2 steps up might be a way through if I can change its property. 

Wait, the key is win, so grabbing it should make me win. But how do I get past the walls? The only movable objects are those not marked as stop. The rules are ""key is win"", ""wall is stop"", and ""baba is you"". If I can change a rule, maybe I can turn a wall into something passable. 

Looking at the rules on the map, there's a ""stop"" rule at 1 step left and 3 steps up. If I can move that ""stop"" rule away, maybe the wall it's attached to becomes passable. But how? The ""stop"" rule is part of ""wall is stop"", so if I remove ""stop"" from ""wall is stop"", then walls wouldn't be stop anymore. 

But to do that, I need to move the text blocks. The ""stop"" rule is at 1 step left and 3 steps up. If I can move that ""stop"" rule elsewhere, perhaps I can delete it or reposition it. However, moving text blocks requires that they're not stopped. Since the walls are stop, but the text blocks themselves might not be. Wait, the rules are objects, so if a text block isn't part of a stop rule, I can move it. 

So, the plan is: move the ""stop"" rule away from the wall, then navigate through the wall. Alternatively, create a new rule that allows Baba to pass through walls. For example, ""baba is stop"" would make me unable to move, which is bad. But if I make ""wall is you"", then walls become passable. 

But to do that, I need to edit the existing rules. The current rules are ""key is win"", ""wall is stop"", and ""baba is you"". To change ""wall is stop"" to ""wall is you"", I need to move the ""stop"" part. The ""stop"" rule is at 1 step left and 3 steps up. If I move that ""stop"" block to replace ""you"" in ""baba is you"", but that might not work. 

Alternatively, create a new rule by combining existing text blocks. For example, if I can get ""wall"" and ""you"" together, I can make ""wall is you"". But where are the text blocks? The ""wall"" rule is at 4 step left and 3 step up, and ""you"" is at 2 step left and 2 steps down. Maybe I need to move the ""you"" text block near the ""wall is stop"" rule to rewrite it. 

This is getting complicated. Let's break it down step by step. 

First, current position: assuming I'm the Baba, based on ""baba is you"" rule. My location is 4 step to the left and 2 steps down from the ""rule `baba`"" object. So, if the ""rule `baba`"" is at (3 step left, 2 steps down), then my position is at (3 + 4, 2 + 2)? Wait, the observation says ""rule `baba` 3 step to the left and 2 steps down"". So, the rule is located 3 left and 2 down from my current position. That means I am at (3 right, 2 up) relative to the ""baba"" rule. 

This is a bit confusing. Maybe it's better to visualize the grid. Let's assume my position is the origin (0,0). Then, the ""rule `baba`"" is at (-3, -2). The ""key"" is at (5,1). The walls are scattered around. 

The active rules are key is win, wall is stop, baba is you. So, to win, I need to get the key at (5,1). But the path is blocked by walls. For example, at (2,1) there's a wall. 

If I can change the ""wall is stop"" rule, then walls become passable. To do that, I need to manipulate the text blocks. The ""wall is stop"" rule consists of ""wall"" at (-4,3), ""is"" at (-3,3), and ""stop"" at (-2,3). If I can move the ""stop"" text block away, then the ""wall is stop"" rule is broken. 

But how do I move the ""stop"" block? The rules say that only objects not defined as stop can be moved. Since walls are stop, but the text blocks themselves might not be. Wait, the ""stop"" property is applied to walls, not the text blocks. So, the text blocks (like ""stop"") can be moved as long as they're not part of a stop rule. 

So, the ""stop"" text block at (-2,3) is part of the ""wall is stop"" rule. If I can move that ""stop"" block to another part of the map, then the ""wall is stop"" rule is no longer active. Then, walls wouldn't be stop anymore, allowing me to pass through them. 

To move the ""stop"" block, I need to navigate to its location. The ""stop"" block is at 1 step left and 3 steps up from my current position (since the rule is ""wall is stop"" located at (-4,3), ""is"" at (-3,3), ""stop"" at (-2,3)). So, from my position (0,0), the ""stop"" block is at (-2,3), which is 2 steps left and 3 steps up. 

But moving there might be blocked. Let's see. From my current position (0,0), to get to (-2,3), I need to go left twice and up three times. Are there walls in the way? 

Looking at the objects: wall at (1,4), (4,4), etc. But the path left and up might be clear. For example, from (0,0) to (-2,3): moving left to (-1,0), then (-2,0), then up to (-2,1), (-2,2), (-2,3). Are there walls there? 

Checking the objects: walls at (2 right,4 up), (4 right,4 up), etc. On the left side, at (-1,3) is there a wall? The observation lists walls at various positions, but not specifically at (-2,3). The ""stop"" block is at (-2,3), but that's a text block, not a wall. So, moving left and up should be possible if there are no walls in the way. 

Assuming I can move to the ""stop"" block, then pick it up and move it elsewhere. Once the ""wall is stop"" rule is removed, walls become passable. Then I can go through the walls to reach the key. 

Alternatively, create a new rule like ""baba is not stop"" or ""baba is win"". But that would require combining text blocks. 

Another approach: the key is win, so if I can get the key, I win. The key is at (5,1). To get there, I need to move right and down. But there's a wall at (2,1). If I can make that wall passable by changing its rule, then I can go through. 

But how? The wall at (2,1) is part of the ""wall is stop"" rule. If I remove the ""stop"" association, then the wall isn't stop anymore. 

So, the plan is: move the ""stop"" text block away from the ""wall is stop"" rule. Once done, the walls are no longer stop, and I can pass through them. Then navigate to the key. 

Alternatively, create a ""baba is win"" rule. To do that, I need to find the ""win"" text block (at 6,4) and combine it with ""baba"". But the ""baba"" rule is at (-3,-2). So, moving ""baba"" and ""win"" together to create ""baba is win"". 

But that might be complicated. Let's focus first on removing the ""stop"" from walls. 

So, steps:

1. Move from current position (0,0) to the ""stop"" text block at (-2,3). 
2. Pick up the ""stop"" block and move it somewhere else, like near the bottom where there are no rules. 
3. This breaks the ""wall is stop"" rule, making walls passable. 
4. Then, navigate around the walls to reach the key at (5,1). 

But how to move the ""stop"" block? Each move can be in one direction. Let's see the path. 

From (0,0) to (-2,3):

- Left twice: ( -1, 0 ), ( -2, 0 )
- Up three times: ( -2, 1 ), ( -2, 2 ), ( -2, 3 )

Assuming no walls in between. Checking the objects, there's a wall at (2 right,4 up), but that's on the opposite side. The path left and up should be clear. 

So, moving left, left, up, up, up. 

After moving the ""stop"" block, say to ( -3, 4 ), then the ""wall is stop"" rule is destroyed. 

Then, walls are no longer stop, so I can walk through them. 

Next, head towards the key at (5,1). From (-2,3), move right five times and down two times. 

But there's a wall at (2,1). Since walls are now passable, I can go through them. So, the path would be right, right, right, right, right (to x=5), and down down (to y=1). 

However, there's also a door at (5,2). Not sure if that's relevant. The key is at (5,1), so maybe the door is a red herring. 

Alternatively, maybe the door needs to be opened, but since the key is win, perhaps just grabbing the key is enough. 

So, the sequence of actions would be:

1. Move left twice to reach the ""stop"" block.
2. Pick up ""stop"" and move it away.
3. Move right to the key's location, passing through walls. 

But how to execute this in the game? Each move is a single step. 

But given the previous failures, maybe the assistant is getting stuck in a loop. The user kept getting ""Failed to obtain a valid action"", possibly because the assistant isn't specifying the direction correctly. 

Looking at the previous actions, the assistant kept alternating between left and right, but maybe the correct path requires more precise movement. 

Alternatively, maybe the key is already accessible if the ""key is win"" rule is active. If I can pick up the key, but the key is an object on the map. Wait, in Baba Is You, you can move objects by pushing them if they're not stop. But the key is probably an object that can be picked up if the rule allows. 

Wait, the rules are key is win, which means that touching the key makes you win. So, maybe I just need to move to the key's position. 

But the key is at (5,1), which is blocked by a wall at (2,1). If walls are stop, I can't move into them. So, I need to change the wall's property. 

So, the correct approach is to manipulate the rules. 

To do that, I need to move the ""stop"" text block. Let's focus on that. 

Current position: let's assume I'm at the position of the Baba, which is where the ""rule `baba`"" is located. The ""rule `baba`"" is 3 steps to the left and 2 steps down from the active rule. So, if the active rule's position is (0,0), then the ""rule `baba`"" is at (-3,-2). Therefore, my position is at (-3 + 3, -2 + 2) = (0,0). 

The ""stop"" text block is at ( -2, 3 ), relative to my position. So, to reach it, I need to move left twice and up three times. 

Each move is one step. So:

1. left (to -1, 0)
2. left (to -2, 0)
3. up (to -2,1)
4. up (to -2,2)
5. up (to -2,3) – here's the ""stop"" block.

Now, I need to pick up the ""stop"" block and move it somewhere else. For example, move it down to ( -2,0 ), which is an empty spot. 

So, after picking up ""stop"", move down:

6. down (to -2,2)
7. down (to -2,1)
8. down (to -2,0) – place the ""stop"" block here.

Now, the ""wall is stop"" rule is broken because the ""stop"" text block is no longer connected to ""wall"" and ""is"". 

Now, walls are no longer stop, so I can pass through them. 

Next, move towards the key at (5,1). From my current position (-2,0), move right five times and down one time:

9. right (to -1,0)
10. right (0,0)
11. right (1,0)
12. right (2,0)
13. right (3,0)
14. right (4,0)
15. right (5,0)
16. down (5,-1) – but the key is at (5,1), so maybe down twice instead?

Wait, the key is at (5,1). From (5,0), moving down once gets to (5, -1), which is not correct. Maybe I made a mistake in coordinates. 

Alternatively, perhaps the coordinates are relative differently. This part is getting confusing without a visual grid. 

Assuming that after moving the ""stop"" block, I'm at (-2,0), then to get to the key at (5,1), I need to move right 7 times and up 1 time. But there's a wall at (2,1). Since walls are now passable, I can go through them. 

So, move right:

From (-2,0) to (5,0):

- Right seven times: (-2,0) → (-1,0) → (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (4,0) → (5,0)

Then move up once to (5,1), which is the key's location. 

Since walls are no longer stop, passing through (2,0) to (2,1) is allowed. 

Once at (5,1), the key is there, and since ""key is win"", touching it would make me win. 

So, the actions needed are:

1. Move left twice, up three times to reach the ""stop"" block.
2. Pick up ""stop"" and move it down to a different location.
3. Move right seven times and up once to reach the key. 

But how to translate this into the allowed actions (up, down, left, right, idle). The assistant needs to output a single action per step. 

However, the previous attempts by the assistant were just alternating left and right, which wasn't working. The user's feedback indicates that valid actions are needed. 

Given that, perhaps the immediate next step is to move left to reach the ""stop"" block. 

Current position: assuming (0,0). Next step: left to (-1,0). Then left again to (-2,0). Then up to (-2,1), etc. 

But the assistant needs to output one action at a time. 

In the latest observation, the assistant tried 'left' and 'right' but failed. Maybe the correct action now is to move up. 

Looking at the latest Observation, after moving right a few times, the position might have changed. But without knowing the exact current position, it's hard to say. 

Alternatively, maybe the key is already accessible by changing another rule. For example, if I can make ""baba is win"", then touching Baba would make me win. But that requires creating that rule. 

To create ""baba is win"", I need to bring the ""baba"" text block, ""is"", and ""win"" together. The ""baba"" rule is at (3 step left, 2 steps down), ""is"" is at various places, and ""win"" is at (6 steps right,4 steps up). 

But that might be too complex. 

Another angle: since the key is win, maybe I can push the key towards me if it's movable. But the key's property is win, not necessarily pushable. Unless ""key"" has a rule that allows it to be pushed. 

By default, objects that are not stop can be moved. Since walls are stop, but the key is win. If ""win"" is not a stop property, then the key can be moved. 

So, perhaps I can move the key towards me. 

The key is at (5,1). To move it, I need to be adjacent and push it. But the path is blocked by walls. 

If I can remove the wall's stop property, then I can move through them and push the key. 

So, circling back to the earlier plan: remove the ""stop"" rule. 

Therefore, the immediate action should be to move towards the ""stop"" block. 

Given that the previous actions were left and right, perhaps the correct path is to move up. 

In the latest Observation, after several left and right moves, the assistant is stuck. Maybe the correct next step is to move up towards the ""stop"" block. 

Alternatively, if the assistant is at the position near the ""stop"" block, the next action is to","

25,right,"<reasoning>
Let me try to figure out what the correct action is here. The active rules are ""key is win,"" ""wall is stop,"" and ""baba is you."" So, normally, the goal is to get the key because it's defined as win, and walls are stoppers. But I need to check the map layout.

Looking at the objects, there's a key at 6 steps to the right and 1 step up. There's also a door at 5 steps right and 2 steps up. The ball is at 3 steps right and 3 steps up. The walls are forming a path. The player (Baba) seems to be at 4 steps left and 2 steps down based on the rule `baba` position. 

Wait, the rule `baba` is at 3 steps to the left and 2 steps down from where? Maybe the player's current position is inferred from that. Let me visualize the grid. The key is down below, and the door is a bit to the left and up from the key. But walls are blocking some paths. The key is win, so grabbing it would make it possible to win. But how to get there?

The rule `key` is part of ""key is win,"" so moving the key text block might change the rule. If I can move ""key is win"" to make ""baba is win,"" that would let me win by touching Baba. Alternatively, moving the key to a different spot. But the key is currently at 6 steps right and 1 step up. To get there, maybe I need to navigate around the walls. 

The path from Baba's position (4 steps left and 2 steps down) to the key: looking at the walls, there's a wall at 2 steps right and 1 step up. Maybe moving down to avoid the walls. But the key is below. Alternatively, maybe moving the text blocks to change the rules. For example, if I can take the ""is"" and ""win"" from the top row and create a new rule like ""baba is win,"" then touching Baba would make me win. 

The ""win"" rule is at 7 steps right and 4 steps up. The ""is"" is at 6 steps right and 4 steps up. So if I can move those two to form ""baba is win,"" that would be ideal. But I need to check if those text blocks are movable. Since the rules are ""wall is stop"" and ""baba is you,"" I can move objects that aren't stop. The text blocks for ""key,"" ""is,"" ""win,"" etc., might not be stop unless specified. So perhaps I can move the ""is"" and ""win"" blocks down to where Baba is. 

But how to get there? The current position of the player (Baba) is based on the rule `baba` at 3 steps left and 2 steps down. So the player is at position (maybe center minus 3 left and 2 down?), but the exact coordinates might not matter. The key is to manipulate the text blocks. If I can create ""baba is win,"" then touching Baba would make the player win. 

So the plan would be to move the ""is"" and ""win"" text blocks next to the ""baba"" rule. The ""baba"" rule is at 3 steps left and 2 steps down. If I can move the ""is"" to adjacent and then ""win"" next to it, forming ""baba is win,"" that would work. To do that, I need to navigate to where those text blocks are. The ""win"" is at 7 steps right and 4 steps up, and ""is"" is at 6 steps right and 4 steps up. Moving down and left from there towards the ""baba"" rule. 

Alternatively, maybe the key is still the way to go. But the key is win, so picking it up would make it a win object. However, the door might be involved. If the door is a stop, but if I can change the rule to ""door is not stop,"" then I could go through it. But that requires manipulating the rules. 

Another angle: since ""key is win,"" picking up the key would make it so that wherever the key is, that's the win condition. So if I can take the key to a location, like next to Baba, then standing there would win. But the key is at 6 right, 1 up. The player is at 3 left, 2 down. So the distance is quite far, and there are walls in the way. 

Maybe the solution is to create ""baba is win"" by rearranging the text blocks. Let's see: the ""baba"" rule is at 3 left, 2 down. The ""is"" is at 6 right, 4 up. The ""win"" is at 7 right, 4 up. So to form ""baba is win,"" I need to move the ""is"" next to ""baba"" and then ""win"" next to ""is."" That would require moving the ""is"" from 6 right,4 up to adjacent to ""baba,"" which is 3 left,2 down. That's a significant move. Alternatively, maybe the text blocks can be moved step by step. 

But how to move them? Since the player is Baba, and ""baba is you,"" the player can move adjacent text blocks that are not stop. The walls are stop, so any text block on a wall can't be moved. Looking at the map, the ""key,"" ""is,"" ""win,"" ""wall,"" ""stop,"" ""door"" rules are on certain positions. The ""door"" is at 5 right, 2 up, which is a wall? No, the wall is at 4 right, 2 up. So the door is separate. 

Perhaps the best approach is to move the ""is"" and ""win"" down to where the player is. The player is at 3 left, 2 down. The ""is"" is at 6 right,4 up. So moving left and down from there. Each move can be one step. But this would take multiple steps. However, the assistant has been trying right and left actions, but maybe needs a different approach. 

Alternatively, since the key is win, maybe the solution is to grab the key. To do that, the player needs to move to the key's location. The key is at 6 right,1 up. The player's position is inferred from the ""baba"" rule at 3 left,2 down. So moving right and up. But there's a wall at 2 right,1 up. So the path might be blocked. 

Looking at the map: 

- Wall at 2 right,1 up.
- Key at 6 right,1 up.
- Door at 5 right,2 up.
- Wall at 4 right,2 up.

So the player needs to go from their position (3 left,2 down) to 6 right,1 up. The path might be blocked by walls. Maybe need to go around. For example, move up to avoid the wall at 2 right,1 up. But how? 

Alternatively, maybe the solution is to change the rule so that ""key is not stop,"" allowing the player to move over it. But the active rules are ""key is win"" and ""wall is stop."" So maybe creating a new rule like ""key is not stop"" by rearranging the text blocks. 

The text blocks for ""key,"" ""is,"" and ""not stop"" (but ""not stop"" isn't present). Wait, the available text blocks are ""key,"" ""is,"" ""win,"" ""wall,"" ""stop,"" ""door."" So to make ""key is not stop,"" you would need ""not"" which isn't present. So that's not possible. 

Another angle: since ""key is win,"" touching the key makes you win. So if the player can reach the key, they can win. But the path is blocked by walls. Let's see the player's position. If the player is at 3 left,2 down, moving right towards the key. But there's a wall at 2 right,1 up. So maybe moving down first, then right. 

But the key is at 1 up, so moving down would take the player away. Hmm. This is getting complicated. Maybe the correct action is to move right to get closer to the key, but previous attempts have failed. Or perhaps the solution is to rearrange the text blocks to make ""baba is win."" 

To do that, the player needs to move the ""is"" and ""win"" next to ""baba."" The ""is"" is at 6 right,4 up. The ""win"" is at 7 right,4 up. The ""baba"" rule is at 3 left,2 down. So moving the ""is"" from 6 right,4 up to adjacent to ""baba"" at 3 left,2 down. That's a distance of 9 steps right and 2 steps down. That's not feasible in one move. 

Alternatively, maybe the player can move the ""is"" and ""win"" blocks step by step towards the ""baba"" rule. But this would take multiple actions. However, the user is expecting a single action here. 

Given the previous attempts of left and right, maybe the correct action now is to move down to approach the key or to position towards the text blocks. Alternatively, move up to get closer to the text blocks on the upper part. 

Looking at the latest observation, after moving right a few times, the key is still out of reach. The active rules haven't changed, so the solution must be either to grab the key or change the rules. Since grabbing the key is blocked, changing the rules to ""baba is win"" seems better. 

To do that, the player needs to move the ""is"" and ""win"" blocks. The ""is"" is at 6 right,4 up. The player's position is inferred from the ""baba"" rule at 3 left,2 down. So the player is somewhere, and the text blocks are up higher. The player needs to move towards those text blocks. 

But how? Maybe the correct action is to move up to get closer to the text blocks. For example, moving up once. Or moving right to get closer to the ""is"" block. 

Alternatively, the player might need to move left to reach the ""baba"" rule's position and then rearrange the text blocks. 

This is tricky. Considering all this, the best action might be to move right towards the ""is"" and ""win"" blocks to start rearranging them. Or move up to get closer. 

Given the previous failures, maybe the correct action now is to move left to adjust position towards the ""baba"" rule. Alternatively, move down to avoid walls. 

But without knowing the exact grid layout, it's hard to be precise. However, based on the latest observation, the key is at 6 right,1 up, and the player needs to get there. But the walls are in the way. 

Another possibility: the door at 5 right,2 up. If the door's rule can be changed, maybe it becomes passable. But there's a rule ""door"" at 5 right,2 up, but no property attached. Maybe creating ""door is you"" to move through it. But that requires text blocks. 

Alternatively, since ""key is win,"" maybe the solution is to take the key and stand on it. But the key is at 6 right,1 up, and the player needs to path there. 

Given the time I've spent and the previous actions, perhaps the correct action now is to try moving right again to get closer to the key. Or move up to reach the text blocks higher up. 

But the assistant's previous attempts of left and right led to failures, maybe because the path is blocked. So perhaps the correct action is to move down to avoid the wall at 2 right,1 up and find another path. 

Alternatively, since the key is win, maybe the player can just move towards it, even if it's blocked, but the walls are stop, so they can't. 

Hmm. This is quite challenging. Given the latest observation, the active rules are the same, and the objects are in the same positions as before. The only difference is the player's position after moving right multiple times. 

In the last observation, after moving right, the player's position might have changed, but the key is still out of reach. The best bet might be to continue moving right to get closer to the key. Or move up to reach the text blocks and change the rules. 

Given that the assistant has been alternating between right and left, maybe the correct action now is to move down to adjust position. 

Alternatively, since the ""baba"" rule is at 3 left and 2 down, maybe moving left from there would get closer to the ""baba"" text block, allowing to rearrange it with ""is"" and ""win."" 

But without knowing the exact coordinates, it's hard. 

After considering all options, the most plausible action is to move right to get closer to the key and the text blocks, possibly to rearrange them into ""baba is win.""

Let's see. The active rules are key is win, wall is stop, and baba is you. I need to figure out how to get to the key because right now key is set as win, so grabbing the key should make me win, right?

Looking at the objects, the key is located at 5 steps to the right and 1 step up. But the path there might be blocked by walls. Let me check the map layout.

Starting from the current position, which seems to be near the bottom left since there are walls to the right and down. To reach the key, I need to move right and up. But there's a wall at 1 step right and 1 step up. Wait, the key is at 5 steps right and 1 step up. So between me and the key, there are walls at 1, 2, 3, 4 steps right on the same level (1 step up). But up there, there's also a rule door at 4 steps right and 2 steps up. Maybe I can rearrange the rules to bypass the walls?

The key is considered a win, so touching it should end the game. But how to get past the walls. Since wall is stop, I can't move into them. But maybe I can change the 'stop' property. If I can move the 'stop' text block, I could make walls not stop me. Let me see where the 'stop' rule is. The rule 'stop' is at 2 steps left and 3 steps up. So to move it, I need to be adjacent to that rule and not be stopped by walls.

But my current position isn't clear. Wait, the baba rule is at 4 steps left and 2 steps down. Maybe I'm near there. If I can move the 'baba' text block to make myself something else, like 'you' or 'win', but the active rules say baba is you. So maybe I can push the 'baba is you' rule somewhere else to free up movement.

Alternatively, since key is win, maybe I just need to reach the key. But the path is blocked by walls. Let me think. The key is at 5 steps right and 1 step up. The walls are at 1, 2, 3, 4 steps right on that level. So to get to the key, I need to go around. Maybe through the upper path? There's a door at 4 steps right and 2 steps up. If I can open the door, that might be a way through. But how?

The door's rule is 'rule door' at 5 steps right and 2 steps up. To open a door, sometimes you need to push it, but in Baba Is You, doors are usually opened by being next to them if the rule allows. Wait, but the current rules don't mention door being open or anything. Maybe I need to create a rule that says 'door is open' or remove the 'stop' property from door. But the 'stop' rule is at 2 left and 3 up, which is a different location.

Alternatively, since wall is stop, if I can remove the 'wall is stop' rule, then walls wouldn't block me. But how? To do that, I need to move the 'wall is stop' text block. Let's see where that is. The 'wall is stop' rule is at 1 step right and 3 step up. So if I can get to that position and move the 'wall' or 'stop' part, maybe I can change the rule. But moving that might require being able to move past the other walls.

This seems complicated. Maybe a simpler approach. Since key is win, I just need to reach the key. Let's check the path again. From my current position (assuming I'm at the bottom left near the baba rule), if I move right multiple times, but there are walls blocking. Alternatively, maybe I can push the walls if they're not stopped. Wait, walls are stop, so I can't push them. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the key is at 5 steps right and 1 step up. If I go up first to avoid the walls on the right. Let's see. If I move up once, I'm at 1 step right and 1 step up, which is a wall. Can't go there. So maybe move right first. But moving right once takes me to a wall. This is tricky.

Alternatively, maybe I can rearrange the rules to make walls not stop. For example, if I can move the 'wall is stop' rule, changing 'stop' to something else. Let me look at the objects again. There's a 'stop' rule at 2 left and 3 up. If I can move that 'stop' text block, maybe I can remove the 'stop' property from walls. But to do that, I need to be adjacent to the 'stop' rule and move it. But how do I get there?

The 'stop' rule is at 2 steps left and 3 steps up. From my current position (assuming near the baba rule at 4 left and 2 down), moving down to 2 steps down would reach the 'you' rule. But that's not helpful. Alternatively, moving up and left. But there are walls. This is getting confusing. Maybe another angle.

Since Baba is You, I can push objects that aren't stopped. But walls are stopped, so I can't push them. However, the key is a win, so if I can reach it by rearranging the rules. For example, if I can create a new rule like 'baba is win', then touching anything win (like the key) would make me win. But how to create that rule.

To create a new rule, I need to have the 'is' text block. Looking at the objects, there's an 'is' at 5 steps right and 4 up (as part of 'key is win'), and another 'is' at 3 steps left and 3 steps up. Maybe I can move those 'is' blocks to form a new rule. For example, take 'baba', 'is', and 'win' to make 'baba is win'. But where are the 'baba' and 'win' text blocks?

The 'baba' rule is at 4 steps left and 2 steps down. The 'win' rule is at 6 steps right and 4 steps up. So if I can move those pieces together. But moving them requires being able to move past walls. This seems complicated, but maybe possible.

Alternatively, since key is win, touching the key would make me win. So if I can reach the key by moving around. But the path is blocked. Let's see the layout again:

- Looking up, at 4 steps right and 4 up is the 'key is win' rule. Below that, at 5 and 4 is 'is', 6 and 4 is 'win'.

At 1 step right and 4 up is a wall. Then at 2 right and 4 up is another wall, etc. So the upper part has walls on the right, but the key is further right but lower down.

Wait, the key is at 5 steps right and 1 step up. So it's below the walls. Maybe I can move down to that area. But there's a wall at 1 step right and 1 step up. So how to get past that.

Alternatively, use the door at 4 steps right and 2 steps up. If I can open the door, then maybe go through it. To open the door, perhaps I need to create a 'door is open' rule. But there's no 'open' text block. The existing rules are key is win, wall is stop, baba is you.

Hmm. Maybe another approach: since Baba is You, and if I can push the 'key is win' rule to make it 'key is you', then the key would be you, and touching it would make me win. But how to do that.

Alternatively, move the 'win' part to 'baba'. For example, take 'baba', 'is', 'win' to make 'baba is win'. But the 'win' is at 6 right, 4 up. To get there, I need to move right past the walls. But the path is blocked.

This is tricky. Maybe the solution is to move the 'stop' rule out of the way so I can pass through walls. The 'stop' rule is at 2 left and 3 up. If I can move that 'stop' text block, then walls wouldn't be stop anymore. But how to reach it.

Assuming I'm near the baba rule at 4 left, 2 down. To get to the 'stop' rule at 2 left, 3 up, I need to move left twice and up once. But there's a wall at 1 step right and 3 step up. Wait, the 'wall is stop' rule is at 1 right, 3 up. So that's a wall. I can't pass through it. So maybe I need to move that 'wall is stop' rule to a different position.

To move the 'wall is stop' rule, I need to be adjacent to it and move it. The 'wall is stop' rule is at 1 right, 3 up. To get there, I need to move right once and up three times. But there's a wall at 1 right, 1 up. So can't get there. This seems impossible.

Alternative idea: since key is win, maybe I don't need to avoid walls. If I can change the 'stop' property. For example, create a rule 'wall is not stop' or 'stop is move'. But how to do that.

The 'stop' rule is a text block that can be moved. If I can move the 'stop' word from the 'wall is stop' rule, making it 'wall is ...' something else. But that requires rearranging the existing rules.

Alternatively, create a new rule that says 'stop is nothing', but there's no 'nothing' text block. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I can push the 'key is win' rule to make it 'key is you'. Then the key would be you, and touching it would make me win. To do that, I need to move the 'win' part of the 'key is win' rule to 'baba'. But the 'win' is at 6 right, 4 up. How to reach there.

Alternatively, use the 'is' blocks to form a new rule. There are multiple 'is' blocks. For example, take 'baba' from 4 left, 2 down, 'is' from 3 left, 2 down, and 'win' from 6 right, 4 up. But moving those would require moving past walls.

This is getting too complex. Let's think of the simplest path. The key is at 5 right, 1 up. The only way to get there is to move right and up, but blocked by walls. Maybe the solution is to rearrange the 'key is win' rule so that 'win' is attached to 'baba', making 'baba is win'. Then touching anything win (like the key) would make me win.

To do that, I need to take the 'win' from the 'key is win' rule and attach it to 'baba'. The 'win' is at 6 right, 4 up. The 'baba' is at 4 left, 2 down. So I need to move those pieces. But how?

Perhaps move the 'is' block from 5 right,4 up (part of 'key is win') between 'baba' and 'win'. So 'baba' + 'is' + 'win' = 'baba is win'. But to do that, I need to move the 'win' text block next to 'baba' and 'is'.

But moving the 'win' block would require moving it past the walls. Let's see. The 'win' is at 6 right,4 up. To get it to near 'baba', I need to move left and down. But there are walls along the way. For example, at 5 right,4 up is 'is', 4 right,4 up is 'key'. So moving left from 6 right,4 up to 5 right,4 up is possible if I can push the 'is' block. But 'is' is part of the 'key is win' rule, which is a text block. Can I push it?

Since the rule 'key is win' is a single text block, maybe I can move the entire block. But text blocks can be moved as units if they're not stopped. But 'key is win' is probably a single block. So if I can move that block, I could rearrange it.

Alternatively, move the 'win' part separately. But text blocks are made of subject, 'is', and property. So you can't separate them. You have to move the entire rule.

So if I can move the 'key is win' rule to become 'baba is win', that would solve it. To do that, I need to move the 'key' part to 'baba' and keep 'is win'. But how?

Maybe by pushing the 'key is win' block to the left, so that 'key' is replaced by 'baba'. But the 'baba' rule is at 4 left, 2 down. So moving the 'key is win' block to the left past the walls. Let's see:

The 'key is win' block is at 4 right,4 up. To move it left, each step would require moving left past the walls. But at 3 right,4 up there's a wall. So can't move left directly. Hmm.

This is really tricky. Maybe another approach: since the key is win, and I'm Baba (you), maybe I can just walk over the key even if it's blocked by walls. But no, walls are stop. Wait, but if I can change the 'stop' property, maybe walls aren't stop anymore. But how?

Alternatively, use the door. The door is at 5 right,2 up. If I can create a rule that says 'door is open', then I can go through it. To create that, I need 'door', 'is', 'open'. But there's no 'open' text block. The available text blocks are key, is, win, wall, stop, baba, you.

So maybe 'door is you'? If I make the door you, then I can walk through it. But to do that, I need to form the rule 'door is you'. The 'you' is at 2 left, 2 down. So if I can move 'you' next to 'door' and 'is'.

The 'door' is at 5 right,2 up. The 'is' blocks are at 6 right,4 up and 3 left,3 up. The 'you' is at 2 left,2 down. It's a long way, but maybe possible.

To move 'you' to the door, I need to move it right and up. But there are walls blocking. For example, at 1 right,1 up is a wall. So unless I can remove the 'stop' property, I can't move through walls.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe the intended solution is to realize that since key is win, you just need to touch the key. But the path is blocked. So perhaps the solution is to rearrange the rules to make the walls not stop.

For example, move the 'stop' rule to change what is stop. If I can make 'key' stop instead of 'wall', then maybe I can go around. But that doesn't help.

Alternatively, create a rule 'baba is stop' so that you are stopped, which would prevent you from moving. Not helpful.

Wait, another idea: if I can make 'win' a stop, then touching the key (which is win) would stop me, but that's bad. Not helpful.

Alternatively, make 'you' a win. Since baba is you, then baba is win. So touching anything win (like the key) would make you win. To do that, create the rule 'baba is win'. How?

Take the 'baba' text block at 4 left,2 down, 'is' from 3 left,2 down, and 'win' from 6 right,4 up. Arrange them as 'baba is win'. But moving those blocks requires navigating past walls.

Assuming I can move the 'is' block first. The 'is' is at 3 left,2 down. If I move it to the right and up, near 'baba' and 'win'. But there's a wall at 1 right,1 up. So maybe push the wall if possible, but walls are stop.

This is really challenging. Maybe the solution is to move the 'key is win' rule to the left, replacing 'key' with 'baba', resulting in 'baba is win'. To do that, I need to move the entire 'key is win' block to the left past the walls. But the block is at 4 right,4 up. Moving left one step would take it to 3 right,4 up, which is a wall. So that's blocked.

Alternatively, move the 'is' block from the 'key is win' rule to another position. For example, use one 'is' to create 'baba is win'. Take 'baba' from 4 left,2 down, 'is' from 5 right,4 up, and 'win' from 6 right,4 up. Arrange them to form 'baba is win'. But how to move them.

The 'is' is part of the 'key is win' rule, so moving it would break that rule. So if I move the 'is' block away, the 'key is win' becomes just 'key win', which is invalid. Then I can create the new rule.

But I need to move the 'is' block to near 'baba' and 'win'. The 'is' is at 5 right,4 up. To get to 'baba' at 4 left,2 down, that's a long distance. Moving left and down, but there are walls in the way.

This seems impossible. Maybe the intended solution is to move right multiple times, but the walls are in the way. Wait, perhaps there's a different path. Looking at the map again:

From the current position (assuming near the bottom left), moving right four times would get to the key, but each step is blocked by walls except the last one. Wait, no. The key is at 5 steps right and 1 step up. So if I move right five times and up once, but the path is blocked.

Alternatively, use the door at 5 right,2 up. If I can push the door, but doors are usually pushed if the rule allows. But there's no rule about door being pushable. Maybe if I make 'door' a you, then I can push it. But to do that, create","

27,right,"<reasoning>
Let me try to figure this out. The current active rules are key is win, wall is stop, and baba is you. So, the goal is to get the key because it's defined as win. But normally, the win might be something else, but here key takes its place.

Looking at the map, the objects are positioned in specific directions. The player is probably at the location of ""rule baba 4 step to the left and 2 steps down"". Wait, no, the player's position isn't directly stated, but since baba is you, the player is the baba object. Let me check where rule `baba` is located. It's 4 steps to the left and 2 steps down from some point. Maybe the starting position is somewhere else, but the exact coordinates might not be necessary. 

The key is to the right, at 5 steps to the right and 1 step up. But between me and the key there's a wall at 1 step to the right and 1 step up. Also, the wall at 1 step right and 1 step up is a stop, meaning I can't pass through it. So how do I get past the walls?

The tip says to move text blocks to create new rules. The key is win, so maybe I need to change the win condition to something else, like door, so I can go through a door without it being a stop. Alternatively, maybe make the wall not a stop. 

Looking at the rules, there's ""wall is stop"" and ""key is win"". The text blocks for these rules are located at different positions. If I can move the ""stop"" property from wall to something else, that might help. For example, if I can make ""stop"" apply to a different object, then the walls wouldn't block me. 

The text blocks for the rules are spread out. The ""key is win"" rule is at 4,5,6 steps right and 4 up. The ""wall is stop"" is at 4 left and 3 up. The ""stop"" rule is at 2 left and 3 up. To move these, I need to be next to a text block and then move it. 

The player (Baba) is at the rule `baba` position: 4 steps left and 2 steps down from somewhere. Let's assume the current position is such that moving right or left can reach the text blocks. 

If I can move the ""wall is stop"" rule, changing it to ""rock is stop"" or something else, then the walls wouldn't stop me. But where are the text blocks for ""wall is stop""? The rule `wall` is at 4 left and 3 up, `is` at 3 left and 3 up, and `stop` at 2 left and 3 up. So the full rule ""wall is stop"" is formed by those three blocks. To break this rule, I need to move one of them. 

Alternatively, create a new rule like ""baba is stop"" which would make the player stop, which is bad. But that's not helpful. Maybe create ""baba is win"" so that reaching Baba himself counts as winning, but I need to check the active rules. Currently, key is win. 

Another idea: the door is a rule at 4 steps right and 2 up. If I can make door not a stop, then I could walk through it. But door's property isn't defined yet. The active rules don't mention door, so it's probably passable unless it's a wall. Wait, the wall is stop, but door isn't mentioned. So maybe door can be walked through. But how to get to the door? There's a key there, but I need the key to be win. 

Wait, the key is already win, so picking up the key would achieve the win condition. But the key is behind a wall. So how to get past the wall? If I can remove the stop property from wall, then the wall isn't blocking. To do that, I need to move the ""stop"" part of the ""wall is stop"" rule. 

The ""stop"" rule is at 2 steps left and 3 steps up. If I move that text block somewhere else, the ""wall is stop"" rule would be broken. So the plan is: move the ""stop"" text block away. But to do that, the player (Baba) needs to be adjacent to the ""stop"" block. 

Looking at the map, the player is at rule `baba` which is 4 steps left and 2 steps down. The ""stop"" block is at 2 steps left and 3 steps up. The distance between the player and the ""stop"" block: from 4 left to 2 left is 2 steps left, and from 2 steps down to 3 up is 5 steps up. That's too far. So maybe the player needs to move closer. 

Alternatively, maybe there's another text block nearby that can be moved to create a new rule. For example, if I can make ""baba is stop"", that would block the player, which is bad. But if I can make ""baba is push"" or something else useful. 

Wait, the available actions are moving directions or idle. But to manipulate text blocks, the player needs to be adjacent to them and then move them. So the player needs to navigate to the text blocks. 

Current position of the player (Baba's rule) is 4 steps left and 2 steps down. Let's see the other objects. The key is 5 steps right and 1 step up. So the player is to the left and below the key. The walls are in various directions. 

To reach the ""stop"" text block at 2 left and 3 up, the player needs to move left and up. From current position (4 left, 2 down), moving left 2 steps and up 3 steps would get to the ""stop"" block. But that's a lot of steps. Alternatively, maybe there's a shorter path. 

Alternatively, look for other text blocks that can be rearranged. The ""door"" rule is at 5 steps right and 2 up. If I can make door not a stop, then perhaps walk through it. But how? 

Another approach: since the key is win, maybe just reach the key regardless of the walls. But the walls are stop, so can't pass. Unless I can move the walls. But walls are defined as stop, so moving them might be possible if they're not part of a rule. Wait, the wall objects are separate from the rules. The rule ""wall is stop"" defines that any wall object is stop. So to move a wall, you might need to make it not a stop, but the rule is still active. 

Hmm, this is tricky. Let me recap:

Active rules:
- key is win: picking up the key wins.
- wall is stop: can't pass through walls.
- baba is you: controlling Baba.

Objects:
- Many walls, key at 5 right, 1 up.
- door at 4 right, 2 up.
- Text blocks for the rules are scattered.

Possible solution: Move the ""stop"" part of the ""wall is stop"" rule to somewhere else, thereby removing the stop property from walls. For example, move the ""stop"" text block to another part of the map, breaking the rule. Then walls wouldn't block movement.

To do that, the player needs to be adjacent to the ""stop"" text block (at 2 left, 3 up). Current player position is 4 left, 2 down. So the distance is 2 steps left and 5 steps up. That's quite far. Maybe the player needs to move in that direction step by step.

But in the previous observations, the assistant kept moving right and left, but maybe that's not effective. Perhaps need to navigate towards the ""stop"" block.

Alternatively, maybe create a new rule like ""baba is stop"" which would block the player, but that's bad. Or ""baba is push"" to push objects.

Wait, the available actions are only movement and idle. To move text blocks, the player has to be adjacent to them and then move in a direction, which would move the text block. So the action would involve moving towards a text block, then moving in a direction to place it elsewhere.

But the problem is that the previous attempts just kept moving right and left, which might not be leading towards the necessary text blocks.

Looking at the latest observation, the player is at rule `baba` 4 step to the left and 2 steps down. The ""stop"" text block is at 2 step to the left and 3 step up. So from the player's position (assuming the player is at the position of the rule `baba`), moving left 2 steps and up 3 steps would reach the ""stop"" block. But that's a lot of moves. Maybe the player needs to move up first.

Wait, perhaps the player's current position is somewhere else. Let me try to visualize the map.

Assuming the player is at the position of the rule `baba`, which is 4 steps left and 2 steps down from some origin. The ""stop"" block is at 2 steps left and 3 steps up. So relative to the player's position, the ""stop"" block is 2 steps to the right (since player is at 4 left, moving right 2 gets to 2 left) and 5 steps up (player is at 2 down, moving up 5 gets to 3 up). So the direction to the ""stop"" block is right and up.

But each action can only move one step. So the player needs to move in a sequence of right and up steps to reach the ""stop"" block. 

In the previous steps, the assistant was moving right and left, but perhaps that's not the optimal path. Maybe the player needs to first move up to reduce the distance.

Alternatively, maybe there's a different text block that can be moved to create a useful rule. For example, if the player can move the ""win"" part of the ""key is win"" rule to another object, making that object the win condition. But the key is already win, and it's located at 5 right, 1 up. If the player can pick up the key (by moving onto it?), but the key's position is 5 right and 1 up, and the player is at 4 left and 2 down. That's quite far.

Wait, perhaps the player can move towards the key, but blocked by walls. Let's see the path from the player's position to the key. Player is at 4 left, 2 down. Key is at 5 right, 1 up. So need to go right 9 steps and up 3 steps. But there are walls along the way. For example, wall at 1 step right and 4 up, 1 step right and 3 up, etc. These walls are stop, so can't pass.

Therefore, the only way is to remove the stop property from walls or find a way around them.

Back to the ""stop"" text block. If the player can reach it and move it, that would break the ""wall is stop"" rule. So the plan is:

1. Navigate from player's position (4 left, 2 down) to the ""stop"" block at (2 left, 3 up).
   - Move right twice (from 4 left to 2 left).
   - Move up five times (from 2 down to 3 up).

But each move is one step. However, in the game, the player can only move one step per action. So the assistant needs to output a sequence of right and up actions.

But in the previous attempts, the assistant was moving right and left alternately, which isn't making progress towards the ""stop"" block. 

Alternatively, maybe the player is adjacent to a text block already. Let's check the objects nearby. The player is at rule `baba` 4 step to the left and 2 steps down. Are there any text blocks in the vicinity? The nearest text blocks are:

- rule `wall` at 4 left, 3 up.
- rule `is` at 3 left, 3 up.
- rule `stop` at 2 left, 3 up.

So the player is at 4 left, 2 down. The closest text block is rule `wall` at 4 left, 3 up. That's one step up from the player's position. So if the player moves up once, they can reach the ""wall"" text block. Then, maybe move it?

But the goal is to get to the ""stop"" block, which is two steps to the right and one step up from the ""wall"" block. So after moving up to the ""wall"" block, the player can move right twice and up once to reach the ""stop"" block. But that requires multiple actions.

However, the assistant's previous actions were just right and left, which isn't effective. Maybe the correct approach is to move up first, then right, then right, then up, etc., to reach the ""stop"" block.

In the current observation, the player is at rule `baba` 4 step to the left and 2 steps down. The ""stop"" block is at 2 left, 3 up. So relative to the player:

- To get to the ""stop"" block: move right 2 steps (from 4 left to 2 left) and up 5 steps (from 2 down to 3 up).

But each action is a single step. So the next logical move is to move right once, then up once, repeating until reaching the ""stop"" block.

Given that the previous attempts failed, perhaps the correct action now is to move up, since the player is at 4 left, 2 down, and the ""stop"" block is at 2 left, 3 up. So first move right, then up.

Wait, let's clarify the directions. The player's position is relative to some origin, but the descriptions are in terms of steps relative to that origin. For example, ""wall 1 step to the right and 4 step up"" means from the origin, the wall is 1 right and 4 up.

But the player's position is given by the rule `baba`'s location: 4 step to the left and 2 steps down from the origin. So the player is at (-4, -2) if we consider the origin as (0,0). The ""stop"" block is at (-2, 3). So the difference is (2 right, 5 up).

Therefore, the player needs to move right twice and up five times. But each action is one step. So the next step should be moving right to get closer.

But in the latest observation, after several right and left moves, the player's position might have changed. However, the observations show that after moving right, the player's position relative to the walls and rules changes, but it's unclear exactly where the player is.

Alternatively, maybe the player is adjacent to a text block they can move. For example, in the current observation, the player is at rule `baba` 4 step to the left and 2 steps down. Are there any text blocks near this position? The nearest text blocks are the ""wall"", ""is"", and ""stop"" rules at 4 left, 3 up; 3 left, 3 up; and 2 left, 3 up. So the player is two steps to the left and five steps up from the ""stop"" block.

Therefore, the next move should be to move right towards the ""stop"" block. So the action should be ""right"".

But the previous attempts kept doing right and left and failed. Maybe the assistant needs to consistently move right and up in the correct sequence.

Alternatively, maybe there's a different approach. Since the key is win, and it's located to the right and up, perhaps the player can push a wall out of the way. But walls are stop, so can't be pushed unless there's a ""push"" rule. But currently, the rules are key is win, wall is stop, baba is you. There's no push rule, so walls can't be moved.

Therefore, the only way is to remove the stop property from walls by moving the ""stop"" text block.

So the correct sequence of actions would be:

1. Move right twice to reach the ""stop"" block's x-coordinate.
2. Move up five times to reach the ""stop"" block's y-coordinate.
3. Once the ""stop"" block is moved, the wall rule is broken, and walls are no longer stop.

But how to move the ""stop"" block? The player needs to be adjacent to it and then move in a direction, which would move the text block there.

Assuming the player can reach the ""stop"" block, moving it to a different location would break the ""wall is stop"" rule.

In the current observation, the player is at 4 left, 2 down. To reach the ""stop"" block at 2 left, 3 up, they need to move right 2 steps and up 5 steps. Each step is one action.

Given that the previous actions were not leading in that direction, the next valid action to progress towards the ""stop"" block is to move right. So the chosen action should be ""right"".

Let's try to figure this out. The active rules are ""key is win"", ""wall is stop"", and ""baba is you"". So the goal is probably to get the key because ""key is win"", but usually in Baba Is You, the win condition is something else. Maybe I need to change the rules to make reaching the key count as winning.

Looking at the objects, there's a key located at 5 steps to the right and 1 step up. But there are walls blocking the path. The walls are defined as stop, so I can't pass through them. The door is at 4 steps right and 2 steps up, but I don't have a key to open it. Wait, the key is the win condition, so maybe if I move the key somewhere else or change the rules?

Also, there's a ""rule `door`"" at 5 steps right and 2 steps up. If I can make the door not a stop, I could maybe go through it. But how? Maybe I need to rearrange the rules. The ""rule `stop`"" is at 2 steps left and 3 steps up. If I can move that rule away or change it, maybe the door becomes passable.

Baba is you, so I can move the baba avatar. The rule `baba` is at 4 steps left and 2 steps down. If I can move that rule to make baba have a new property, like ""baba is push"" or something, maybe I can push walls. But right now, walls are stop, so pushing might not help unless I can remove the stop property.

Another thought: since ""key is win"", maybe just grabbing the key makes me win? But in the past, sometimes the win condition is a specific object. Maybe I need to create a new rule like ""baba is win"" or move the key to a different spot. But how?

The key is at 5 right, 1 up. If I can move the key rule (the ""key is win"" text) to make it ""baba is win"", then touching baba would win. But to do that, I need to move the ""win"" rule. The ""win"" rule is at 6 right, 4 up. So if I can push that ""win"" rule next to ""baba"", then changing it to ""baba is win"".

But how do I move the rules? The game allows moving text blocks if they're not defined as stop. The ""stop"" rule is at 2 left and 3 up. The walls are stop, but the text blocks that define stop might not be stop themselves. Wait, the rule ""stop"" is a text block, but since wall is stop, does that mean the text block ""stop"" is movable? Or is the text block fixed because it's defined as stop? Hmm, the tips say you can only move objects or text that are not defined as stop or similar. Since ""stop"" is a property, maybe the text block ""stop"" is movable.

So, if I can move the ""stop"" rule away, then maybe I can move other rules. Let's see. The key is win, so if I can make ""baba is win"" instead, then touching baba would win. To do that, I need to move the ""win"" rule (which is part of ""key is win"") and attach it to ""baba"". But to do that, I need to break the existing ""key is win"" rule into its components: ""key"", ""is"", ""win"". If I can move ""win"" away from ""key"" and place it next to ""baba"", then create a new rule ""baba is win"".

But how to do that step by step. First, maybe move the ""is"" rule from the key's position. The ""is"" is at 5 right, 4 up. If I can move that to somewhere else. But to move it, I need to be adjacent to it and not blocked by stop. The path might be blocked by walls. Maybe I need to push a wall out of the way by being a you (which I am, since baba is you). But walls are stop, so pushing them requires that the direction you push isn't blocked by another stop. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule first. The ""stop"" is at 2 left, 3 up. If I can move that, then other rules might be movable. But how? Since baba is you, I can move adjacent objects that aren't stop. The ""stop"" rule is a text block. Is the text block ""stop"" considered stop? Because the wall is stop, but the text block itself might be separate. The rule ""stop"" defines that wall has the stop property. So the text block ""stop"" itself might not be stop, unless it's attached to a wall. So maybe I can move the ""stop"" text block.

If I move the ""stop"" rule to another spot, then walls might no longer be stop. Wait, no. The rule ""wall is stop"" defines that walls have the stop property. So even if I move the ""stop"" rule, the walls would still be stop unless I change the ""wall is stop"" rule. But moving the ""stop"" rule away doesn't affect the wall's property. So that might not help.

Alternative approach: since the key is the win condition, maybe I just need to grab the key. But the key is at 5 right, 1 up, which is below the current position. The problem is the path is blocked by walls. The walls are at 1 right, 4 up down to 1 right, 1 up. So the path to the key is clear horizontally but vertically there are walls. Wait, the key is at 5 right, 1 up. The current position of baba is not specified in the latest observation, but assuming the player is at the starting point, maybe needing to navigate through the grid.

Wait, the latest observation shows the rule `baba` at 4 left, 2 down. So the baba avatar is there. To get to the key at 5 right, 1 up, the path might be blocked by walls. Let me visualize the map.

Looking at the objects:

- Wall 1 step right and 4 up
- rule `key` at 4 right, 4 up
- rule `is` at 5 right, 4 up
- rule `win` at 6 right, 4 up
- rule `wall` at 4 left, 3 up
- rule `is` at 3 left, 3 up
- rule `stop` at 2 left, 3 up
- wall 1 right, 3 up
- ball 2 right, 3 up
- wall 1 right, 2 up
- rule `door` at 5 right, 2 up
- wall 1 right, 1 up
- key at 5 right, 1 up
- wall 1 right
- wall 1 right, 1 down
- rule `baba` at 4 left, 2 down
- etc.

So the key is at 5 right, 1 up. To get there, the path is blocked by walls at 1 right, 1 up. The key is one step to the right of that wall. So if I can move the wall, but walls are stop, so I can't push them unless I'm pushing them in a direction where there's no stop. But the wall at 1 right, 1 up is adjacent to the key. If I can move that wall, maybe by creating a rule that makes it not stop. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the door at 5 right, 2 up can be used. But the door is likely a stop unless its rule is changed. The rule `door` is at 5 right, 2 up. If I can change the door's property, maybe make it passable. But I need to move the rules.

Another angle: the ""key is win"" rule means that having the key makes you win. So if I can pick up the key, does that automatically win? In some levels, grabbing the key wins, but maybe here it's different. If the active rule is ""key is win"", then maybe touching the key makes you win. But according to the tips, the goal is usually to reach an object defined as win. So maybe the key is the win object, so just being near it isn't enough; you have to make it so that touching the key (or baba) counts as winning.

Alternatively, maybe I need to create a rule like ""baba is win"" to make touching baba win. To do that, I need to move the ""win"" rule from the key to baba. The ""win"" rule is at 6 right, 4 up. So if I can move that ""win"" text block next to ""baba"" and combine it with ""baba is"", which is at 4 left, 2 down.

But moving the ""win"" text block would require it to be movable. Since ""win"" is part of the ""key is win"" rule, maybe breaking that rule by moving the ""is"" or ""win"" parts. For example, if I move the ""win"" from the key's rule to somewhere near baba, then create ""baba is win"".

So step by step:

1. Move the ""is"" rule from the key's position (5 right, 4 up) to a new location. Maybe near the baba's rule.

2. Move the ""win"" rule (6 right, 4 up) next to the ""baba"" rule (4 left, 2 down).

3. Then, create the new rule ""baba is win"" by placing the ""baba"", ""is"", and ""win"" text blocks together.

But how to do this in movement actions. The player (baba) is at 4 left, 2 down. To move the ""is"" rule from 5 right, 4 up to, say, 3 right, 4 up (moving left), but there might be walls blocking. The path from 5 right, 4 up to 4 right, 4 up would require moving left through open space? Let's see. The objects at 4 right, 4 up are the ""key"" rule. So ""is"" is at 5 right, 4 up. To move left, the next step is 4 right, 4 up, which has the ""key"" rule. Can I move past that? Since ""key"" is part of the ""key is win"" rule, but the key itself is an object. If the key is an object, can I move it? The rules say you can only move objects or text that are not stop. The key is an object; its property is win. Since win isn't stop, maybe the key can be moved. Wait, no. The objects' movability is determined by their properties. If an object is defined as stop, you can't move it. But the key's property is win, not stop. So the key can be moved.

So, if I move left from the ""is"" rule's position (5 right, 4 up) to 4 right, 4 up (where the key is), then I can move further left if possible. But the key is at 4 right, 4 up, and the ""is"" is at 5 right, 4 up. So to move the ""is"" rule left, I need to be adjacent to it and move it. But the player is at 4 left, 2 down, which is quite far. How to get near the ""is"" rule?

This seems complicated. Maybe there's a simpler way. Since the key is the win object, maybe I just need to reach it. But the path is blocked by walls. The walls at 1 right, 1 up are stop, so I can't pass through them. But if I can make the walls not stop, then I can go through. To do that, I need to change the ""wall is stop"" rule. The ""wall is stop"" rule is at 4 left, 3 up. If I can move that rule away, then walls would no longer be stop. But moving that rule would require accessing its position.

The ""wall is stop"" rule is at 4 left, 3 up. The player is at 4 left, 2 down. So to get to 4 left, 3 up, the player needs to move up two steps. But the path might be blocked. Let's see: from 4 left, 2 down, moving up one step to 4 left, 1 down. Then up to 4 left, 2 down (same position). Wait, maybe the coordinates are different. The observation shows various positions, but it's a bit confusing. Maybe it's easier to focus on the key and how to reach it.

Alternatively, maybe the ball at 2 right, 3 up is irrelevant. The main target is the key. Since the key is win, perhaps I can just move to it. But how? The path is blocked by walls. The walls are stop, so I can't push them. Unless I can change their property.

Another idea: use the door. The door is at 5 right, 2 up. If I can make the door not a stop, then I could go through it. The door's rule is at 5 right, 2 up. If I can change the door's property, like making it ""door is push"" or removing the stop property. But how?

Alternatively, maybe create a new rule that makes ""baba"" able to move through stop objects. Like ""baba is push"" or ""baba is move"". But to do that, I need to manipulate the existing rules.

The current rules are ""key is win"", ""wall is stop"", and ""baba is you"". If I can change ""baba is you"" to ""baba is push"", then I could push walls. But to do that, I need to break the existing ""baba is you"" rule into its components and replace it.

The ""baba"" rule is at 4 left, 2 down, with ""is"" at 3 left, 2 down, and ""you"" at 2 left, 2 down. So to change ""you"" to ""push"", I would need to move the ""you"" text block and replace it with ""push"". But ""you"" is part of the ""baba is you"" rule, so moving it would break that rule. Then I could create ""baba is push"".

But how to move the ""you"" text block. The ""you"" is at 2 left, 2 down. The player is at 4 left, 2 down. So the distance is 2 steps to the left. If the path is clear, the player can move left twice to reach the ""you"" text block. But there might be walls in the way. Looking at the objects, between 4 left, 2 down (player) and 2 left, 2 down, is there anything? The objects listed are walls at various positions, but not directly in that path. So maybe the player can move left twice to reach the ""you"" text block.

Once there, the player can pick up the ""you"" text block and move it to a new location, say next to ""baba"" and ""is"", replacing ""you"" with ""push"". Then the new rule would be ""baba is push"", allowing the player to push stop objects. Then, push the walls out of the way to reach the key.

This seems like a possible path. Let's outline the steps:

1. Move from the player's position (4 left, 2 down) to the ""you"" text block at 2 left, 2 down. Move left twice.

2. Pick up the ""you"" text block and move it to a new position, say next to ""push"" if available, or create the ""push"" text block elsewhere. But the problem is, the player might not have the ""push"" text block. So instead, move ""you"" away and place it next to ""baba"" and ""is"" with a new property. Wait, but the available text blocks are key, is, win, wall, stop, door. So maybe replace ""you"" with ""win"" to make ""baba is win"", but that's what we tried earlier.

Alternatively, move ""you"" to create a new rule like ""baba is push"". But since there's no ""push"" text block, maybe that's not possible. Unless the player can create new text blocks by combining others, but the game might not allow that. You can only move existing text blocks.

So perhaps the correct approach is to change ""baba is you"" to ""baba is win"", making touching baba win. To do that, move the ""win"" text block from the key's rule to the baba's rule.

Here's how:

1. Move the ""is"" text block from the key's rule (5 right, 4 up) to somewhere else to break the ""key is win"" rule. For example, move it left to 4 right, 4 up.

2. Move the ""win"" text block (6 right, 4 up) to the baba's rule area (4 left, 2 down). The path would require moving the ""win"" block down and left multiple steps, overcoming any obstacles.

But the ""win"" block is at 6 right, 4 up. The player is at 4 left, 2 down. That's a significant distance. The player would need to move right six steps and up two steps, but there are walls blocking the way. For example, at 1 right, 4 up there's a wall. So moving right from 4 left, 2 down to 1 right, 2 down (if possible), then up to 1 right, 3 up (wall there), then 1 right, 4 up (wall). This seems impractical.

Alternative idea: use the existing rules to create a path. If I can make certain objects passable, maybe the walls can be moved. For example, if I change ""wall is stop"" to ""wall is push"", then walls can be pushed. But to do that, I need to manipulate the ""wall is stop"" rule.

The ""wall is stop"" rule is at 4 left, 3 up. The player is at 4 left, 2 down. So moving up to 4 left, 3 up would require one step up. Is that possible? The path from 4 left, 2 down to 4 left, 3 up is clear? Looking at the objects, there's a rule `wall` at 4 left, 3 up, which is the ""wall is stop"" rule. The adjacent objects are rule `is` at 3 left, 3 up and rule `stop` at 2 left, 3 up. So the player can move up from 4 left, 2 down to 4 left, 3 up, which has the ""wall is stop"" rule. Then, the player can move","

Let's try to figure out how to solve this Baba Is You level. The active rules are key is win, wall is stop, and baba is you. My goal is to reach the key or whatever is defined as win.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key located at 5 steps to the right and 1 step up. The current rule says key is win, so grabbing that key should make me win. But the path to the key is blocked by walls. The wall is stop, so I can't move through it unless I change the rules.

Baba is you, which means I can move and manipulate text blocks. So I need to figure out how to rearrange the rules to bypass the walls. The door is at 4 steps right and 2 steps up, but I don't know if that's useful yet.

Looking at the text blocks, there's a rule `door` at 4,2. Maybe if I can create a rule that makes the door not a stop, I could use it. But to do that, I need to move the `door` text block and combine it with other properties. However, the door itself is an object, not a rule yet. Wait, the rule `door` is a text block that's part of a rule. So the current rule is door, but there's no property assigned to it. Maybe if I can change the rule to make door IS NOT stop, or make door IS YOU or something else.

But how to do that? I need to move the existing text blocks. The rule `key` is at 4,4 up. To create a new rule, I need to pick up a text block and place it with a subject and property. For example, if I take the `is` block next to `key` and combine it with `door` and a property like `stop`, maybe I can override the wall is stop rule.

Wait, the active rules are key is win, wall is stop, and baba is you. The rule `door` is just a text block; it's not part of any active rule yet. So if I can create a rule like door is not stop, that might remove the stop property from the door. But how?

Alternatively, maybe I can move the `stop` rule to somewhere else. The `stop` rule is at 2 steps left and 3 steps up. If I can move that rule away or break it apart, walls might no longer be stop. But walls are defined as stop by the rule wall is stop. If I can remove that rule, then walls wouldn't be stop anymore. But the rule wall is stop is at 4 steps left and 3 steps up. To move that, I need to pick up the `wall` text block and the `stop` text block and separate them.

But right now, the `wall` rule is part of the active rule ""wall is stop"". To break that, I need to move either the `wall` text block or the `stop` text block away. Let's see where they are. The `wall` text block is at 4 steps left and 3 steps up, and the `is` is at 3 steps left and 3 steps up, and `stop` is at 2 steps left and 3 steps up. So they are all in a horizontal line. To break the ""wall is stop"" rule, I need to separate them. Maybe move the `stop` block down or somewhere else.

But I have to be careful because some objects are stop. The walls are stop, so I can't move them unless I change the rule. Wait, the player is Baba, defined as you, so I can move any objects that aren't stop. So the text blocks that aren't part of a stop rule can be moved. Let's check which text blocks are stop. The `stop` rule is at 2 left, 3 up. So the `stop` text block itself is movable unless it's part of a rule that makes it stop. But the rule is ""wall is stop"", so the `stop` text block is just a normal object unless it's part of a rule. So I can pick it up and move it.

So the plan is: move the `stop` rule away from the `wall` and `is` to break the ""wall is stop"" rule. Once walls are no longer stop, I can walk through them. Then go grab the key. But the key is behind multiple walls. Alternatively, create a rule that makes the door not stop, so I can go through it.

Alternatively, maybe create a rule like ""baba is stop"", but that would make me stop, which is bad. So I need to avoid that.

Another approach: since key is win, maybe I can reach the key by moving around the walls. But the path is blocked by walls on the right. Let me visualize the map.

Looking at the objects:

- There's a wall 1 step right and 4 up, then the rule key at 4 right,4 up, followed by is, then win. So the top right has the key, is, win arranged horizontally.

- Below that, at 1 right,3 up is a wall, then ball at 2 right,3 up, then another wall at 1 right,2 up. Then rule door at 4 right,2 up. Then more walls descending to key at 5 right,1 up.

So the key is at the bottom right. The path to the key is blocked by walls on the right side. The door is at 4 right,2 up, which is between the key area and the ball area.

If I can turn the door into a passable object, maybe by creating a rule like ""door is you"" or ""door is win"", but I think the key is already win. Alternatively, make door not stop. But to do that, I need to create a new rule.

But first, I need to move the existing text blocks. Let's see where I am. The player is at the position of rule `baba` which is at 4 left, 2 down. So my current position is 4 steps left and 2 steps down from the reference point.

To move a text block, I need to be adjacent to it and then move in the direction of the text block. Wait, no, in Baba Is You, you can push objects (text blocks) by moving into them from the side. So if I'm next to a text block, I can move in the direction of the block to push it.

So, for example, if I'm next to the `is` block at 3 left,2 down, and I move left, I can push that `is` block further left.

But the goal is to rearrange the rules. Let's say I want to break the ""wall is stop"" rule. The `wall` text block is at 4 left,3 up, `is` at 3 left,3 up, and `stop` at 2 left,3 up. To break this rule, I need to separate them. Let's try to move the `stop` block down.

From the current position (4 left,2 down), I need to navigate to the `stop` block at 2 left,3 up. The path would involve moving left twice to get to 2 left, then up three steps. But there might be walls in the way. The walls are at various positions, but since walls are stop, I can't move through them. So I need to find a path around the walls to reach the `stop` block.

Alternatively, maybe there's a different approach. Since key is win, perhaps I can grab the key by moving around the walls. Let's check the key's location: 5 right,1 up. From my current position (4 left,2 down), moving right three steps and up two steps would get me to 1 right,0 down, but I'm not sure. Wait, the coordinates might be relative. Let me try to map this mentally.

Assuming the player starts at the position of the `baba` rule, which is 4 steps left and 2 steps down from the top-right corner (or whatever the reference point is). The key is at 5 steps right and 1 step up from the reference point. So to reach the key, I need to move right 5 steps and up 1 step, but there are walls blocking the way.

The walls are along the right side: 1 right,4 up; 1 right,3 up; 1 right,2 up; etc. So the right side is blocked by walls. The door is at 4 right,2 up, which might be a way through if I can make it passable.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule that makes the door not a stop. To do that, I need to move the `door` text block and combine it with a property like `not stop` or `win`. But I don't have a `not` text block. The available text blocks are key, is, win, wall, stop, door, baba, you.

Hmm. Another idea: since ""baba is you"", maybe I can create a rule that makes me able to move through stops. For example, ""baba is not stop"". But to create that, I need to have the `not` text block, which I don't see on the map. The available text blocks are key, is, win, wall, stop, door, baba, you. So no `not` or `push` or other properties.

Wait, the available text blocks are limited. Let's list them:

- rule `key` at 4 right,4 up

- rule `is` at 5 right,4 up

- rule `win` at 6 right,4 up

- rule `wall` at 4 left,3 up

- rule `is` at 3 left,3 up

- rule `stop` at 2 left,3 up

- wall at 1 right,3 up

- ball at 2 right,3 up

- wall at 1 right,2 up

- rule `door` at 4 right,2 up

- wall at 1 right,1 up

- key at 5 right,1 up

- wall at 1 right

- wall at 1 right,1 down

- rule `baba` at 4 left,2 down

- rule `is` at 3 left,2 down

- rule `you` at 2 left,2 down

- wall at 1 right,2 down

So the text blocks I can manipulate are the ones marked as ""rule"" or objects like key, door, etc. The `not` property isn't present, so I can't create negation rules.

Another approach: since the key is win, maybe I can reach it by pushing the walls aside. But walls are stop, so I can't move them. Unless I change their property. If I can break the ""wall is stop"" rule, then walls become normal and I can move through them.

To break ""wall is stop"", I need to separate the `wall`, `is`, and `stop` text blocks. The current setup is `wall` - `is` - `stop` at 4 left,3 up; 3 left,3 up; 2 left,3 up. So they're in a horizontal line. If I can move the `stop` block away from this line, the rule ""wall is stop"" would be broken.

How to move the `stop` block? The `stop` block is at 2 left,3 up. To move it, I need to be adjacent to it and push it. My current position is at rule `baba` which is 4 left,2 down. To get to the `stop` block at 2 left,3 up, I need to move left twice to get to 2 left, then up three steps. But along the way, are there walls blocking?

Looking at the map:

- From 4 left,2 down (my position), moving left to 3 left,2 down: there's a wall at 1 right,2 steps down? Wait, the walls are at various positions. Let me check:

Walls are at:

- 1 step right and 4 up

- 1 right,3 up

- 1 right,2 up

- 1 right,1 up

- 1 right

- 1 right,1 down

- 1 right,2 down

So the left side has few walls. The `stop` block is at 2 left,3 up. From my position (4 left,2 down), moving left to 3 left,2 down: is there a wall there? The only walls on the left are at 1 right, which is the opposite direction. So moving left from 4 left would be towards more left, which seems open.

Wait, the coordinates might be relative. Maybe the map is grid-based, and moving left decreases the x-coordinate, right increases, up increases y, down decreases y.

Assuming that, my position is at (4 left, 2 down), which would be coordinates (x=-4, y=-2) if left is negative x and down is negative y. The `stop` block is at 2 left,3 up, which is (x=-2, y=3).

To get there, I need to move from (x=-4, y=-2) to (x=-2, y=3). That means moving right (increasing x) by 2 steps, and up (increasing y) by 5 steps. But along the way, are there walls?

Looking at the walls listed:

- wall 1 step to the right and 4 step up: (x=1, y=4)

- wall 1 right,3 up: (1,3)

- wall 1 right,2 up: (1,2)

- wall 1 right,1 up: (1,1)

- wall 1 right: (1,0)

- wall 1 right,1 down: (1,-1)

- wall 1 right,2 down: (1,-2)

So the right side has walls from y=4 down to y=-2. The left side (x negative) has few walls except maybe the ones created by the rules. The `stop` block is at (-2,3), and there's a wall at (1,3). So the path from (-4,-2) to (-2,3) would be through open space since there are no walls in between on the left side.

So I can move right twice and up five times to reach the `stop` block. Once there, I can push it away. For example, move left to take the `stop` block away from the ""wall is stop"" rule.

But how to push the `stop` block? Since I'm a you (Baba), I can move objects that aren't stop. The `stop` block itself is part of the ""wall is stop"" rule, but once separated, it might just be a normal object. So if I move to the `stop` block's position and push it left, that would break the rule.

So step-by-step:

1. Move from (4 left, 2 down) to (2 left,3 up) by moving right twice and up five times.

2. Once at (2 left,3 up), which is the `stop` block, push it left. This would move it to (3 left,3 up), separating it from the `wall` and `is` blocks.

3. Now the ""wall is stop"" rule is broken, so walls are no longer stop. I can walk through them.

4. Then, go to the key at (5 right,1 up). Since walls are no longer stop, I can move around them.

But wait, the key is at 5 right,1 up. From my new position at (2 left,3 up), moving right 7 steps and down 2 steps would get me there. But there are walls on the right side (from x=1 to x=5, y varies). Since walls are no longer stop, I can walk through them. So I can move right past the walls.

Alternatively, take a path around. For example, move right past the walls at x=1, then go down to the key.

But maybe there's a more efficient way. Once the walls are not stop, I can just walk through them. So from the `stop` block's new position, move right towards the key.

Another option: create a new rule that makes the door passable. The door is at 4 right,2 up. If I can make door IS YOU or door IS WIN, then I can use it. But to do that, I need to create a new rule by moving text blocks.

For example, take the `door` block at 4 right,2 up, and move it to create a rule like ""door is you"". To do that, I need an `is` block and a `you` block.

The `you` block is at 2 left,2 down. So from my position at 2 left,3 up, I need to get to the `you` block at 2 left,2 down. Move down once to get there.

Once at 2 left,2 down (the `you` block), I can push it up to combine with the `door` block. For example, move up to the `door` block at 4 right,2 up. Wait, that's a distance of 2 steps right and 1 step up. From 2 left,2 down, moving right 6 steps and up 5 steps to reach 4 right,2 up. That's a long way, but possible.

Alternatively, find a closer `is` or `you` block. The `you` block is at 2 left,2 down. The `is` blocks are at 5 right,4 up; 3 left,3 up; 3 left,2 down.

This seems complicated. Maybe first break the ""wall is stop"" rule, then proceed to the key.

So back to the plan: break ""wall is stop"" by moving the `stop` block. Once that's done, walk through walls to the key.

Another thing: the ball is at 2 right,3 up. Maybe it's a distraction.

In summary, the steps would be:

1. Move to the `stop` block at 2 left,3 up.

2. Push it left to break the ""wall is stop"" rule.

3. Now walls are passable.

4. Move right through the walls to the key at 5 right,1 up.

But how to move to the `stop` block? Let's map the path:

Current position: 4 left,2 down (x=-4, y=-2)

Goal: 2 left,3 up (x=-2, y=3)

Move right twice: x becomes -2, y=-2.

Then move up five times: y becomes 3.

So the path is right, right, up, up, up, up, up.

But need to ensure there are no walls in the way. Looking at the walls, the only walls are on the right side (x=1 to 5","

Let's try to figure out what to do here. The active rules are key is win, wall is stop, and baba is you. My goal is usually to reach the win object, which is the key in this case. However, the key is currently at 5 steps to the right and 1 step up. But there are walls all around, and some are marked as stop, which means I can't move through them.

Looking at the objects, I see that Baba is me because of the rule ""baba is you"". So, I need to move Baba to the key. But the key is blocked by walls. Let's check the map layout. 

The key is at 5 right, 1 up. Above that, there's a wall at 1 right, 4 up, and then the rules key, is, win. To the left of the key is a wall at 1 right, 1 up. So maybe the path is blocked. But there's a door at 4 right, 2 up. If I can get to the door and maybe change the rules, perhaps I can remove the stop property from walls or make the door not a stop.

Wait, the rule ""door"" is there. If I can make door not a stop, then maybe I can go through it. But how? To change a rule, I need to rearrange text blocks. The current rules are key is win, wall is stop, and baba is you. The rules are formed by text blocks like ""key is win"", which is three objects: key, is, win. 

If I can move the ""is"" or ""win"" parts to create a new rule, like ""door is not stop"" or something. But first, I need to see where the text blocks are located. The rule ""door"" is at 5 steps right and 2 steps up. The ""is"" blocks are at various positions. For example, there's an ""is"" at 5 right, 4 up (part of ""key is win""), another at 3 left, 3 up (part of ""wall is stop""), and another at 4 left, 2 down (part of ""baba is you"").

To create a new rule, I need to combine a subject with a property. Suppose I move the ""is"" from 5 right, 4 up (next to win) to be next to door and stop. Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at 2 left, 3 up. If I can take the ""is"" from 3 left, 3 up (which is part of ""wall is stop"") and place it next to door and something else. But I need to make sure that the subject and property are correctly placed.

Alternatively, maybe I can take the ""is"" from 4 left, 2 down (near the baba rule) and move it to door and, say, ""not stop"". But I don't have a ""not stop"" text block. Hmm. The only properties here are win, stop, you, is, key, wall, door.

Wait, the rule ""key is win"" makes key into win. So if I can make door be win, then reaching the door would be the win condition. But how? To do that, I need to create a rule like ""door is win"". But where are the text blocks for that? The ""win"" is already used in the key is win rule. Maybe I can move the ""win"" from key's rule to door's rule.

So the current key is win rule is made of key, is, win at positions 4,5,6 right,4 up. If I can move the ""win"" from there to be next to door and is, that would create ""door is win"". Then, the active rule would be door is win, making the door the win condition. Then I can go to the door instead of the key.

But to do that, I need to physically move the ""win"" text block from its current position to be next to door and is. Let's see. The ""win"" is at 6 right,4 up. The door is at 5 right,2 up. There's a path? Let's check the map. Between 6 right,4 up (win) and 5 right,2 up (door), there's a wall at 1 right,3 up, then another at 2 right,3 up, etc. It might not be possible to move the win block directly there because of the walls. Unless I can push the blocks past the walls, but walls are stop, so I can't move through them.

Alternatively, maybe I can rearrange the existing rules. The ""wall is stop"" rule is at 4 left,3 up, 3 left,3 up, 2 left,3 up. If I can move the ""stop"" to somewhere else, but that might not help. Alternatively, create a rule that says ""door is not stop"", but again, I don't have a ""not stop"" block.

Another idea: since Baba is you, maybe I can push other objects. For example, push the key towards the door. But the key is at 5 right,1 up, and the door is at 5 right,2 up. So the key is one step below the door. If I can move the key up, but there's a wall at 1 right,2 up. Wait, the wall at 1 right,2 up is between the key and the door. So the key is blocked by that wall. Unless I can remove the wall's stop property.

To remove wall's stop property, I need to change the rule ""wall is stop"" to something else. For example, ""wall is you"", but then walls would be controllable. But how? The ""wall is stop"" rule is made of three blocks: wall, is, stop at 4 left,3 up; 3 left,3 up; 2 left,3 up. If I can move the ""stop"" block somewhere else, then the rule would be broken. But moving the ""stop"" block would require being able to move it past the stop walls. But the area around 2 left,3 up is probably blocked by walls.

Alternatively, create a new rule that overrides ""wall is stop"". For example, ""baba is stop"", making Baba a stop, which would block me from moving. Not helpful. Alternatively, ""baba is win"", which would make me the win condition, so I just need to touch myself. But how do I do that? The current rules are key is win, so maybe I need to deactivate that rule.

Wait, the active rules are key is win, wall is stop, baba is you. If I can break the ""key is win"" rule by moving its components. The key is at 4 right,4 up, is at 5 right,4 up, win at 6 right,4 up. If I can move the ""win"" block away, then the key is win rule would be deactivated. But again, moving the win block is blocked by walls.

This is getting complicated. Let's recap:

- Goal is to reach key (which is win) but it's blocked by walls.
- Alternatively, create a new rule where door is win, then go to door.
- To create door is win, need to place door, is, win in proximity.
- The win block is currently with key, so need to move it.
- The door is at 5 right,2 up. The win is at 6 right,4 up. There's a path? From 6 right,4 up to 5 right,4 up (is), then down to 5 right,2 up (door). But the way down might be blocked by walls. Let's check:

From win at 6 right,4 up, move left to 5 right,4 up (is). Then down to 5 right,3 up. But there's a wall at 2 right,3 up (no, the wall at 1 right,3 up). Wait, the walls are at various positions. Let me visualize the map:

Looking at the objects:

- Wall at 1 right,4 up
- Rule key at 4 right,4 up
- Rule is at 5 right,4 up
- Rule win at 6 right,4 up
- Rule wall at 4 left,3 up
- Rule is at 3 left,3 up
- Rule stop at 2 left,3 up
- Wall at 1 right,3 up
- Ball at 2 right,3 up
- Wall at 1 right,2 up
- Rule door at 4 right,2 up
- Wall at 1 right,1 up
- Key at 5 right,1 up
- Wall at 1 right
- Wall at 1 right,1 down
- Rule baba at 4 left,2 down
- Rule is at 3 left,2 down
- Rule you at 2 left,2 down
- Wall at 1 right,2 down

So the key is at 5 right,1 up. To get there, I need to move down from higher up, but there's a wall at 1 right,1 up blocking the path. The door is at 4 right,2 up. Maybe I can go to the door instead. To make door win, I need to create the rule door is win. The win block is at 6 right,4 up. If I can move the win block down to near the door.

But moving the win block from 6 right,4 up to, say, 4 right,2 up (door's position) would require moving through other objects. Let's see the path:

From 6 right,4 up (win), move left to 5 right,4 up (is), then left to 4 right,4 up (rule wall). But rule wall is at 4 left,3 up, which is 4 steps left from the starting point? Wait, maybe the coordinates are relative to the player's position. This is a bit confusing without a visual map.

Alternatively, perhaps the player is located somewhere on the map, and needs to move around. The key is win, so touching the key wins. But the key is blocked. The door is at 4 right,2 up. If I can make door win, then touching the door would win. To do that, I need to form the rule ""door is win"". The ""door"" is at 5 right,2 up, ""is"" is available somewhere, and ""win"" is at 6 right,4 up.

So the plan is: move the ""win"" block from 6 right,4 up to be next to ""door"" and ""is"". But how to move the ""win"" block? The player (Baba) is likely at the position of the ""baba"" rule, which is at 4 left,2 down. So the player is 4 steps left and 2 steps down from their current reference point. To move the ""win"" block, the player needs to navigate to where the ""win"" block is, then push it towards the door and ""is"" block.

But the way might be blocked by walls. For example, from the player's position at 4 left,2 down, moving right to reach the rules. Let's see:

Player is at 4 left,2 down. To get to the ""win"" block at 6 right,4 up, need to move right and up, but there are walls in the way. For example, at 1 right,4 up there's a wall. Wait, no, the wall at 1 right,4 up is one step to the right and four up from the player's position. The player is at 4 left,2 down, so relative positions might be different. This is getting too confusing without a clear map.

Alternative approach: Since the key is win, and it's blocked, maybe the intended solution is to push the key over the wall by rearranging the rules. For example, make the wall not a stop. If I can change the rule ""wall is stop"" to ""wall is you"", then walls would be controllable. But how?

The ""wall is stop"" rule is made of three blocks: wall, is, stop at positions 4 left,3 up; 3 left,3 up; 2 left,3 up. To change this, I need to move the ""stop"" block to another property, like ""you"". But I need to have a ""you"" block. The ""you"" block is part of the ""baba is you"" rule at 2 left,2 down. 

So if I can take the ""is"" from the ""wall is stop"" rule and replace it with ""you"", creating ""wall is you"". Then walls would be you, meaning I can push them. But to do that, I need to move the ""is"" block from the wall's rule to the baba's rule. For example, take the ""is"" at 3 left,3 up (part of wall is stop) and move it to be next to baba and you, making ""baba is you"" into ""baba is [something else]"", and creating ""wall is you"".

But this requires precise movement. Let's see:

Current ""baba is you"" rule is at 4 left,2 down (baba), 3 left,2 down (is), 2 left,2 down (you). If I move the ""is"" from 3 left,3 up (part of wall is stop) to 3 left,2 down, then the baba rule becomes ""baba is [nothing]"", and the wall rule becomes ""wall is stop"" with one less component. Then, placing the moved ""is"" next to wall and you would create ""wall is you"".

But this is quite complex. Alternatively, maybe the solution is simpler. Since the key is win, and it's at 5 right,1 up, and there's a door at 4 right,2 up. If I can make the door win by creating the rule ""door is win"", then going to the door would win. To do that, I need to move the ""win"" block from the key's rule to the door's position.

The ""win"" block is at 6 right,4 up. The door is at 5 right,2 up. So the path from win to door would involve moving left and down. But there's a wall at 1 right,3 up, which might block the way. Alternatively, maybe the player can push the ""win"" block by temporarily making walls not stop. But that requires changing rules.

This is really tricky. Maybe another angle: since the key is win, and it's stuck, perhaps the intended solution is to push the key by rearranging the text blocks to make the wall a you, allowing it to be pushed. For example, change ""wall is stop"" to ""wall is you"". Then, walls can be moved, and the key can be pushed over the wall.

To change ""wall is stop"" to ""wall is you"", you need to replace the ""stop"" with ""you"". The ""you"" block is at 2 left,2 down. So take the ""is"" from the wall's rule (at 3 left,3 up) and move it next to wall and you, creating ""wall is you"". Then, the wall's rule changes, and walls become you, so they can be pushed.

Once walls are you, the player can push the key. The key is at 5 right,1 up, blocked by a wall at 1 right,2 up. If the player can push that wall aside, then the key can be moved. But the player is at 4 left,2 down. How to reach the key? Maybe move right and up, pushing walls.

Alternatively, once walls are you, the player can move through them, but the rules say wall is you, meaning you can move through walls? Wait, no. The ""you"" property means that the subject can be moved. So if a wall is you, then you can move it, but you can't move through it unless the rule says stop is not a barrier. This is getting too complicated.

Perhaps the simplest solution is to move the ""win"" block from the key's rule to the door's rule. Since the key is win, making the door win would allow winning by reaching the door. To do that, the player needs to navigate to the win block at 6 right,4 up, move it down to near the door at 5 right,2 up, and place it with ""is"" and ""door"".

But moving the win block requires passing through other objects. From the player's position at 4 left,2 down, moving right and up to reach the win block. There's a wall at 1 right,4 up, but maybe the path is clear otherwise. Once the win block is next to door and is, the rule becomes door is win, and the player can go to the door.

However, the player might be blocked by other walls. For example, to get from the player's position to the win block, they need to move right four steps and up four steps, but there's a wall at 1 right,4 up. That would block the path. So perhaps the player needs to rearrange the rules first to remove that wall's stop property.

Alternatively, if the player can make the wall not a stop, then they can go around. But again, that requires changing the wall is stop rule.

This is really challenging. Given the time I've spent and the previous failed attempts, maybe the correct action here is to move towards the door and try to create the door is win rule by moving the win block. But how?

Alternatively, since the key is win and it's at 5 right,1 up, maybe the player needs to push the key by rearranging the text blocks. For example, move the ""win"" block next to the key and an ""is"" block to make ""key is win"" again, but that doesn't help. Wait, the key is already win. So the problem is accessing it.

Another thought: maybe the ball is irrelevant here. The key is the objective. Since the key is blocked by a wall at 1 right,2 up, and the wall is stop, maybe the solution is to push the wall aside by making it you. So change ""wall is stop"" to ""wall is you"". To do that, take the ""is"" from the wall's rule (at 3 left,3 up) and move it next to wall and you, creating ""wall is you"". Then, the wall can be pushed.

Once the wall is you, the player can push it, allowing the key to be moved. So the steps would be:

1. Move to the ""is"" block of the wall's rule (3 left,3 up).
2. Push it next to the wall and the ""you"" block (2 left,2 down), creating ""wall is you"".
3. Now, walls can be pushed.
4. Push the blocking wall at 1 right,2 up aside.
5. Then, push the key at 5 right,1 up towards the door or wherever.

But navigating to those positions requires avoiding stop walls. The player is at 4 left,2 down","

Let's try to figure out what to do here. The active rules are key is win, wall is stop, and baba is you. The goal is probably to get the key because key is win, but maybe I can change that. Looking at the objects, there's a key located at 5 steps right and 1 step up. The wall is stop, so I have to avoid those. Baba is you, so I can move around as Baba.

Looking at the map, there's a rule `baba` 4 steps left and 2 steps down. If I can get to that area, maybe I can manipulate the rules. The `is`, `you`, and `baba` text blocks are there. If I move those, I can create new rules. For example, if I make ""baba is win"" or something like that, then touching Baba would make me win. Alternatively, changing ""key is win"" to ""baba is win"" would let me win just by being near Baba.

But first, I need to move. The key is down below, but there's a wall directly to the right. Wait, the current position must be somewhere. Let me try to visualize the map. The key is at 5 right, 1 up. The walls areStopping movement in some directions. Maybe I need to move towards the key but navigate around the walls.

Alternatively, focusing on the rule manipulation. The rule section on the left has `baba`, `is`, and `you`. If I can combine those to create ""baba is win"", then I can win just by standing there. To do that, I need to move the `baba` text block next to `is` and `win`. But where is the `win` rule? It's at 6 right, 4 up. That's quite far. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to make the door the win condition by moving the `door` rule with `is` and `you`.

Wait, the door is at 4 right, 2 up. If I can say ""door is win"", then reaching the door would make it win. But how to do that? The current active rules are key is win. To change that, I need to move the `key is win` text blocks apart and create a new rule.

The `key` rule is at 4 right, 4 up. The `is` next to it is at 5 right, 4 up. The `win` is at 6 right, 4 up. So the current rule is ""key is win"". To break this, I could move the `is` or `win` away. But I need to do that while avoiding walls.

Looking at my current position, the wall is 1 step right and 4 up. So maybe I'm to the left of that. The `baba` rule is 4 steps left and 2 steps down from somewhere. Maybe I need to move towards that area to manipulate the rules.

Alternatively, focus on moving the key. The key is at 5 right, 1 up. The path there is blocked by walls at 1 step right and 1 up. Wait, the wall at 1 right and 1 up is a stop. So I can't go through that. Maybe I need to go around. If I move left from the current position, but the wall is 1 step right and 4 up. Hmm, maybe my current position is somewhere in the middle.

Alternatively, use the fact that I'm Baba and can push objects if they're not stop. But the walls are stop, so I can't push them. The key is a separate object. Maybe I can move towards the key, but the path is blocked. Let me check the objects again.

There's a wall at 2 right, 1 step up, and the key is at 5 right, 1 step up. So between me and the key, there are walls at 2, 3, 4 steps right in the 1 up position. That's a solid wall blocking the path. So maybe I can't get the key directly. Alternatively, create a new rule to change the win condition.

If I can make ""baba is win"", then standing where I am (as Baba) would make me win. To do that, I need to move the `baba`, `is`, and `win` text blocks together. The `baba` rule is at 4 left, 2 down. The `is` is at 3 left, 2 down. The `you` is at 2 left, 2 down. The `win` rule is at 6 right, 4 up. That's quite far. Alternatively, maybe use the `door` as the win condition.

The door is at 4 right, 2 up. If I can say ""door is win"", then going to the door would make it win. To do that, I need to move the `door`, `is`, and `win` together. The `is` is at 5 right, 4 up. The `win` is at 6 right, 4 up. The `door` is at 4 right, 2 up. So maybe move the `is` down to near the door. But how?

Alternatively, use the existing `is` at 5 right, 4 up. If I can move that down to where the door is, then combine it with `door` and `win`. But the `win` is far away. Maybe this is complicated.

Another approach: since ""baba is you"", maybe I can push the `baba`, `is`, and `you` blocks to form a new rule. For example, ""you is win"" or ""baba is win"". Let's see. The `you` is at 2 left, 2 down. The `is` is at 3 left, 2 down. The `baba` is at 4 left, 2 down. If I can arrange them as ""baba is win"", I need to move the `win` rule close. The `win` is at 6 right, 4 up. That's a long way. Maybe not feasible.

Alternatively, since the key is win, but it's blocked, maybe the solution is to change the rule to ""key is not stop"" or something. But how? The `stop` rule is at 2 left, 3 up. If I can move that, but walls are stop, so I can't push them. Hmm.

Wait, the `wall` rule is at 4 left, 3 up, defined as ""wall is stop"". Maybe if I can change ""wall is stop"" to something else, like ""wall is push"" or ""wall is nothing"". But to do that, I need to break the existing rule and create a new one. The existing rule is ""wall is stop"" made by the text blocks at 4 left, 3 up: rule `wall`, rule `is`, rule `stop`. To break this, I need to move one of these blocks away.

But moving those blocks would require navigating to their positions. The `wall` rule is at 4 left, 3 up. The `is` is at 3 left, 3 up. The `stop` is at 2 left, 3 up. If I can move the `stop` block away, then the ""wall is stop"" rule would be broken. But how to get there? The path might be blocked by other walls.

Alternatively, focus on the area where `baba`, `is`, and `you` are. If I can form ""baba is win"" there, then I win. The `win` rule is at 6 right, 4 up. That's pretty far. Maybe I can move the `win` block closer. But again, movement is restricted by walls.

Wait, the key is at 5 right, 1 up. If I can pick up the key (by moving next to it) and then use it to unlock something. But the key is a separate object; I'm not sure how interacting with it works. The active rule says ""key is win"", so maybe grabbing the key makes me win. But how do I interact with the key? In Baba Is You, usually, you have to touch the object. So if I move to the key's position, touching it would make me win because ""key is win"".

But the path is blocked by walls. Let's see: the key is at 5 right, 1 up. To get there, I need to move right from my current position. But there's a wall at 1 right, 1 up. Wait, the wall at 1 right, 1 up is a stop, so I can't move through it. Maybe I need to go around. If I move up from the current position, but there's a wall at 1 right, 4 up. Hmm.

Alternatively, is there a way to push a wall? No, because walls are stop. Maybe I can use the rule manipulation to make walls passable. For example, changing ""wall is stop"" to ""wall is you"". But that would require moving the `stop` block away.

Looking at the `wall is stop` rule: the `wall` text is at 4 left, 3 up. The `is` is at 3 left, 3 up. The `stop` is at 2 left, 3 up. If I can move the `stop` block to another location, the rule would be broken. Then I could create a new rule like ""wall is you"", making walls passable. But how to move the `stop` block?

To move the `stop` block, I need to be adjacent to it and move in a direction that's not blocked. The `stop` block is at 2 left, 3 up. Where am I currently? Not sure, but the observations show various walls and rules. Maybe my position is somewhere near the `baba` rule at 4 left, 2 down. If I'm there, I can move around.

Assuming I'm near the `baba` rule, I can try to move the `baba`, `is`, and `you` blocks to form a new rule. For example, move `is` next to `baba` and `win`. But the `win` is far away. Alternatively, use the existing `win` rule at 6 right, 4 up. Maybe there's a way to get there by moving through other areas.

Alternatively, focus on the door at 4 right, 2 up. If I can make ""door is win"", then reaching the door would work. The `door` rule is at 4 right, 2 up. The `is` is at 5 right, 4 up. The `win` is at 6 right, 4 up. So to create ""door is win"", I need to move `door`, `is`, and `win` together. But the `is` and `win` are up high, while the door is down low. This might be tricky.

Another idea: since ""baba is you"", maybe I can push the `you` block to create a new rule. For example, ""you is win"". The `you` block is at 2 left, 2 down. If I move it next to `is` and `win`, that could work. But again, the `win` is far away.

Perhaps the key is to realize that ""key is win"" means touching the key makes you win. Even if it's blocked, maybe there's a way to reach it by moving the walls or rules. Alternatively, the solution is to change the rule to ""baba is win"" by moving the relevant blocks.

Given the previous failed attempts, maybe the correct action is to move towards the area where the `baba`, `is`, and `you` blocks are, to form a new rule. For example, move right to get closer to those blocks. But the movement options are limited by walls.

Alternatively, the correct action is to move left towards the `baba` rule area. Let's see: the `baba` rule is at 4 left, 2 down. If I move left from my current position, but there might be walls blocking the way. The wall at 1 step right and 2 steps down is there, but if I'm to the left of that, moving left further might be possible.

Alternatively, the solution is to move the `is` block from 5 right, 4 up to be next to `baba` and `win`. But the distance is too big.

Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe the intended solution is to move the `win` rule to be next to `baba` and `is` by rearranging the text blocks. Since the `win` is at 6 right, 4 up, and the `baba` is at 4 left, 2 down, it's a significant distance. Perhaps the key is to move the `key` to the `win` position, but I don't see how that helps.

Wait, another angle: if I can make ""key is not stop"", then the wall blocking the path might be bypassable. But how? The `stop` property is defined by ""wall is stop"". If I can remove that rule, then walls aren't stop anymore. To do that, I need to move the `stop` block away. The `stop` block is at 2 left, 3 up. If I can move it to another location, say next to `baba`, then the ""wall is stop"" rule would be broken.

Assuming I can move the `stop` block, I would need to navigate to its position. The `stop` is at 2 left, 3 up. From my current position (assuming I'm near the `baba` rule at 4 left, 2 down), moving up and right might get me there. But there are walls at certain positions. For example, the wall at 1 right, 4 up is blocking the upper area.

This is getting complicated. Given the time I've spent and the previous failed actions, maybe the best course is to try moving towards the `baba` rule area to manipulate the rules. So the action would be to move left or up towards those blocks.

Let's try to figure out what to do here. The active rules are key is win, wall is stop, and baba is you. That means touching the key makes me win, walls are obstacles I can't pass through, and since I'm Baba, I can move around as per the rules.

Looking at the objects on the map. There's a key at 5 steps right and 1 step up. To get there, I need to navigate through the walls. But wait, the key is defined as win, so grabbing it should make me win. However, the path might be blocked by walls or other stop properties.

Looking at the position of the rules. There's a rule ""key is win"" up high, and other rules like ""wall is stop"" and ""baba is you"" scattered around. Maybe I can manipulate these rules to bypass obstacles. For example, if I can change ""wall is stop"" to something else, maybe walls become passable. But how?

The player is Baba, right? So if I can move the ""baba is you"" rule somewhere else, maybe I can become another object. Like, if I move ""baba"" to ""key"" and make ""key is you"", then I could turn into the key and walk over walls. But the key is already set as win. Hmm.

Alternatively, the door is at 5 steps right and 2 steps up. If I can open the door, that might be a path. But how? The door might require a key, which is what I'm trying to get. So maybe the key is blocking the door's interaction.

Looking at the current position of the player (Baba). The rules for Baba are at 4 steps left and 2 steps down. To move towards the key, I need to go right multiple times. But the path to the key at 5 steps right, 1 step up is blocked by walls. For instance, there's a wall at 1 step right, 1 step up, and another at 2 steps right, 1 step up. So moving straight right isn't possible.

Wait, the key is at 5 steps right and 1 step up. The player (Baba) is probably at the position where the ""baba is you"" rule is, which is 4 steps left and 2 steps down. So from there, moving right multiple times would be necessary. But the walls are in the way. Maybe I need to rearrange the rules to make the walls non-stop.

The ""wall is stop"" rule is at 4 steps left and 3 steps up. If I can move that rule elsewhere, walls might become passable. But to move a rule, I have to touch both the subject and the property text blocks. For example, to remove ""wall is stop"", I need to move the ""wall"" text and ""stop"" text apart. But how?

Alternatively, create a new rule that changes ""stop"" to something else. Like, ""wall is push"" or ""stop is nothing"". But I don't see a ""push"" or ""nothing"" rule here. The available text blocks are key, is, win, wall, door, stop, baba, you.

If I can combine ""wall"" with another property. For instance, if I make ""wall is you"", then walls would be controllable. But I need to have the text blocks for ""wall"" and ""you"" near each other. The ""you"" rule is at 2 steps left and 2 steps down. So perhaps moving the ""wall"" rule (which is at 4 steps left and 3 steps up) near the ""you"" rule.

But moving text blocks requires that they're not stopped. The ""stop"" rule is at 2 steps left and 3 steps up, which might affect movement. Wait, ""wall is stop"" means walls are stop, but the text blocks themselves might not be stopped unless they're part of a wall. The text blocks for rules are probably movable unless they're part of a STOP object.

So, to move the ""wall is stop"" rule, I need to go to the ""wall"" text (at 4 left, 3 up) and the ""is"" and ""stop"" texts. If I can separate them, the rule would change. For example, moving the ""stop"" text away from ""wall is"".

But the player is Baba, which is at 4 left, 2 down. So from there, moving up to the rule texts at 4 left, 3 up (wall), 3 left, 3 up (is), 2 left, 3 up (stop). If I can swap the ""stop"" with another property, maybe make ""wall is you"" instead.

Alternatively, create a new rule ""baba is stop"", but that would make me a stop, which I can't pass through. Not helpful.

Wait, the key is win. If I can reach the key, then according to the rule, I win. So the main goal is to get to the key. The key is at 5 right, 1 up. But the path is blocked by walls. Let's see the map layout:

From Baba's position (4 left, 2 down), moving right:

- 1 step right: wall
- 2 steps right: wall
- 3 steps right: ball and wall
- 4 steps right: rule 'key' at 4 right,4 up, but also a wall at 1 right,1 up, etc.

Maybe there's a way to go around using the door. The door is at 5 right,2 up. If I can open the door, perhaps by having the key nearby. But how does the door work? Usually, in Baba Is You, a door requires a key to unlock. So if I bring the key to the door, it should open.

But the key is at 5 right,1 up, and the door is at 5 right,2 up. So if I move the key next to the door, then I can walk through. But the key is currently 4 steps right and 4 up? Wait, no, the key's position is 5 steps right and 4 step up according to the observation. Wait, looking back:

In the current observation, the key is at 5 steps to the right and 4 step up. Wait, no, let me check:

The objects list says:

key 5 steps to the right and 1 step up

Ah, right. So key is at 5 right,1 up. Door is at 5 right,2 up. So the key is directly below the door. If I can move the key next to the door, then I can open it. But to move the key, I need to touch it, but the key is an object. Since the rule is ""key is win"", touching the key makes me win. But maybe I can push the key? Wait, can I push objects? The rules don't mention push, but ""wall is stop"" means walls can't be pushed. If there's no rule about pushing, maybe I can move the key by stepping on it?

But the key is at 5 right,1 up. From my current position (Baba at 4 left, 2 down), I need to move right multiple times. Let's count the steps:

1. Move right to 1 right,2 down (but there's a wall there).
2. Then right again to 2 right,2 down (wall again).
3. Then to 3 right,2 down (ball and wall).
4. Then to 4 right,2 down (rule 'door' at 4 right,2 up, so maybe above that is the door? Not sure.)

Alternatively, maybe go up first. From 4 left,2 down, move up to 4 left,1 down, then right to 3 left,1 down, etc. But this is getting complicated.

Another approach: Since ""baba is you"", I can move around. The problem is the walls. If I can change the ""wall is stop"" rule, then walls become passable. How? By moving the 'stop' part of the rule. The ""wall is stop"" rule is composed of 'wall' at 4 left,3 up, 'is' at 3 left,3 up, 'stop' at 2 left,3 up. To break this rule, I need to separate them. For example, move the 'stop' text block away from 'wall is'.

So, if I can move the 'stop' text from 2 left,3 up to another position, then the rule 'wall is stop' would be broken, making walls not stop. That would allow me to pass through walls.

To do that, I need to touch the 'stop' text block. Since I'm Baba, and 'baba is you', I can move. Let's see where the 'stop' text is: 2 steps left and 3 steps up. From my current position at 4 left,2 down, moving up and left.

Path to 'stop' text:

From 4 left,2 down:

- Move up once to 4 left,1 down.

- Move left once to 3 left,1 down.

- Move up once to 3 left,0 down.

- Move left once to 2 left,0 down.

- Then up to 2 left,1 down.

- Then up again to 2 left,2 down.

- Then up to 2 left,3 down (which is 2 left,3 up relative to the starting point? Wait, the coordinate system might be a bit confusing. The observations mention directions like 'step to the left', 'step up', etc. Assuming that the player's position is a reference point.

Alternatively, maybe the 'stop' text is at 2 left,3 up from the player's current position. So from Baba's position (4 left,2 down), moving left 2 steps and up 3 steps would reach the 'stop' text. But there might be walls in the way.

Looking at the objects:

- At 4 left,3 up: rule 'wall'

- 3 left,3 up: rule 'is'

- 2 left,3 up: rule 'stop'

So the 'stop' text is adjacent to the 'is' and 'wall' texts, forming the 'wall is stop' rule. To break this, I need to separate them. For example, move the 'stop' text away.

So the plan is: move to the 'stop' text block at 2 left,3 up, then move it somewhere else. But how? Each text block can be moved one step at a time, and I can only move them if they're not part of a STOP object. Since the 'stop' text is part of the 'wall is stop' rule, but the rule itself is active. However, text blocks that are part of an active rule can still be moved, unless the rule makes them stop. Since 'wall is stop' makes walls stop, but the text blocks themselves are not walls unless they're placed as such.

Wait, the text blocks are separate objects. For example, a 'wall' text block is an object that can be moved unless there's a 'stop' rule applied to it. But in this case, the 'stop' rule is applied to walls, not to the text blocks. So the 'stop' text block is just a movable object, unless it's part of a rule that makes it stop. But the rule is 'wall is stop', which affects wall objects, not the text blocks.

Therefore, I can move the 'stop' text block. So from Baba's position at 4 left,2 down, I need to navigate to 2 left,3 up (the 'stop' text). Let's see the path:

1. From 4L,2D move left to 3L,2D.

2. Move left to 2L,2D.

3. Move up to 2L,1D.

4. Move up to 2L,0D.

5. Move up to 2L,3U (which is 2 left,3 up from the original position).

Once there, I can move the 'stop' text block. If I move it one step to the left, say to 1L,3U, that would break the 'wall is stop' rule. Then walls would no longer be stop, allowing me to pass through them.

Alternatively, move it down or another direction. The goal is to separate 'wall' from 'stop' in the rule.

So the action sequence would be:

- Move left twice to reach 2L,2D.

- Move up twice to reach 2L,3U (the 'stop' text).

- Then move the 'stop' text left or right to break the rule.

Assuming each move is valid (not into a STOP object or blocked), this could work.

Once 'wall is stop' is broken, walls become passable. Then I can walk through the walls to reach the key.

Alternatively, if I can make 'baba' a 'win' by rearranging rules. For example, if I can make 'baba is win', then touching any baba (myself) would make me win. But that might be more complex.

Another approach: Since the key is win, maybe I don't need to move it, just touch it. But the key is at 5R,1U, and there are walls blocking the path. If walls are stop, I can't pass. So changing the wall rule is essential.

Therefore, the best action is to move the 'stop' text block to break the 'wall is stop' rule, making walls passable, then navigate to the key.

The active rules are key is win, wall is stop, and baba is you. So, normally, I need to get the key because it's defined as win. But there's a door, I think, which might be the exit. However, if the key is win, maybe picking up the key makes me the win object. The problem is that the key is all the way to the right, but there's a wall blocking the path. The walls are stop, so I can't move through them.

Looking at the objects, I'm BABA, and since ""baba is you,"" I can move around unless there's a stop rule. The key is at 5 steps to the right and 1 step up. But to get there, I need to navigate past walls. The walls are positioned at various steps, both up and down. The rule blocks might be movable since they're not labeled as stop. Wait, the active rules include ""wall is stop,"" so any object labeled wall is immovable. But the text blocks like ""key is win"" can be moved if they're not stop. 

So, maybe I need to move the ""key is win"" rule to a different position so that the key isn't the win object anymore. Or perhaps change the win rule to something else. Alternatively, move the door rule so I can go through it. But the door is at 5 steps to the right and 2 steps up, and there's a wall there as well. 

Alternatively, since I'm BABA and ""baba is you,"" maybe I can push objects that aren't stop. Wait, but the walls are stop, so I can't push them. The key is at 5 steps right and 1 up. If I can move the key to a different spot, but the key itself is an object, not a rule. Hmm. 

Wait, the rules are text blocks that define properties. The key is an object that's considered win because of the ""key is win"" rule. If I can remove that rule or change it, maybe the key's win property is revoked. But how? The rules are on the map, so I need to move the ""key is win"" text block. Let me check the objects again. 

Looking at the current objects, there's a rule `key` at 6 steps right and 4 up, rule `is` at 7 right and 4 up, rule `win` at 8 right and 4 up. So the ""key is win"" rule is a combination of those three text blocks. To break this rule, I need to move one of those components. Since I'm BABA, and assuming I can move text blocks that aren't stop, I should move one of those three text blocks (key, is, win) to elsewhere. 

For example, moving the ""win"" text block away from the ""key is"" part would break the rule. Let's say I move the ""win"" rule to the left. If I move it 1 step to the left, then the ""key is win"" rule would no longer be connected, effectively removing that rule. Then, the key wouldn't be win anymore. But what's the new win condition? The original active rules are still there unless changed. Wait, the active rules are key is win, wall is stop, and baba is you. So if I break the ""key is win"" rule, the remaining rules are wall is stop and baba is you. Then, perhaps the actual win condition is elsewhere, like a different object. 

But in the current setup, there's no other win object mentioned. The ball is at 4 steps right and 3 up. Maybe if I make the ball the win object by creating a ""ball is win"" rule. To do that, I need to have the necessary text blocks (ball, is, win) in the correct positions. However, the ""win"" text block is currently part of the ""key is win"" rule. If I move it, maybe I can place it with the ball. 

Alternatively, focus on reaching the key first. Since the key is at 7 steps right and 1 up, but there's a wall at 3 steps right and 1 up. Wait, the key is 5 steps to the right and 1 step up from my current position? Let me clarify the positions. The observation says the objects are relative to my position. For example, ""wall 1 step to the right and 4 step up"" means there's a wall in that direction. 

Assuming I'm at the starting position, perhaps the layout is such that to get to the key, I need to move right past some walls. But the walls are stop, so I can't. Therefore, I need to rearrange the rules. Let's focus on breaking the ""key is win"" rule. The three text blocks for that rule are at 6,7,8 steps right along the upper part. If I can move the ""win"" block (at 8 steps right) leftwards, say to 5 steps right, then the rule would be broken. 

To move the ""win"" block, I need to be adjacent to it and move it in a direction. Since the ""win"" block is at 6 steps right and 4 up (the rule `win` is at 6 steps right and 4 up), I would need to move left from there. But how do I get to that position? My current position might be at the origin, and the objects are spread out. 

Alternatively, move the ""is"" block between key and win. If I move the ""is"" block, that would break the connection between key and win. For example, moving the ""is"" from 7 steps right to 6 steps right, so the key is at 6, is at 6, and win at 8. That might not disconnect them, but if the blocks need to be adjacent to form the rule, moving one apart could break it. 

Another approach: create a new rule that changes the win condition. For instance, make ""baba is win"" so that touching the key (which is now just a key) allows me to win. But to do that, I need the ""baba"", ""is"", and ""win"" text blocks in the right positions. The existing ""win"" block is part of the ""key is win"" rule, but if I can move it, say to be near ""baba"" and ""is"", then I can form a new rule. 

Looking at the current objects, there's a rule `baba` at 2 steps left and 2 steps down, rule `is` at 1 step left and 2 steps down, and rule `you` at 2 steps down. The ""win"" block is at 6 steps right and 4 up. So to create ""baba is win"", I need to move the ""win"" block to be adjacent to ""baba"" and ""is"". That might involve moving the ""win"" block leftwards across the map. 

But moving the ""win"" block would require navigating past other objects. The path from 6 steps right and 4 up to, say, 2 steps left (where the baba rule is) would involve moving left multiple times, but there are walls in the way. For example, at 3 steps right and 3 up there's a wall, and other walls block the path. So maybe it's not feasible to move the ""win"" block directly to the baba area. 

Alternatively, maybe push the key to a different location. Since the key is an object, not a rule, and the rules don't state that keys are stop, perhaps I can move the key. If I can move the key to be under the door, then maybe the door opens when I have the key. But the door's rule is ""door"", and it's at 6 steps right and 2 up. There's a wall at 3 steps right and 2 up, so the path to the door might be blocked. 

Wait, the door is at 6 steps right and 2 up. The key is at 7 steps right and 1 up. So if I can move the key to 6 right and 2 up, which is where the door is, maybe that allows me to win by standing on the door with the key. But I'm not sure how the game mechanics work here. 

Another angle: since the key is defined as win, maybe picking it up makes me win. So if I can reach the key, then touching it would make me the win object. But the problem is the path is blocked by walls. The walls are stop, so I can't move through them. Therefore, I need to remove the walls or move them. But the walls are objects with the stop property, so unless I can change the stop rule, I can't move them. 

The active rules include ""wall is stop"", so any object named wall is stop. If I can change that rule to something else, like ""wall is nothing"", then walls would be movable. To do that, I need to break the ""wall is stop"" rule. The rule is formed by the text blocks ""wall"", ""is"", and ""stop"". Their positions are: rule `wall` at 4 steps left and 3 step up, rule `is` at 3 steps left and 3 step up, rule `stop` at 2 steps left and 3 step up. So these three are connected to form ""wall is stop"". If I can move one of these blocks, the rule is broken. 

For example, moving the ""stop"" block away from the ""wall is"" part. If I move the ""stop"" block one step to the left, then the rule is no longer connected, so ""wall is stop"" is removed. Then, walls wouldn't be stop anymore, and I could potentially push them out of the way. 

But how to move the ""stop"" block? The ""stop"" rule is at 2 steps left and 3 step up. To move it, I need to be adjacent to it and move it in a direction. Assuming I'm BABA (you), I can move left, right, up, or down. If I move left from the ""stop"" block's position, but there's a wall at 1 step left and 3 step up. Wait, the objects include rule `stop` at 2 step left and 3 step up, and rule `is` at 3 step left and 3 step up, and rule `wall` at 4 step left and 3 step up. So these three form the ""wall is stop"" rule. 

If I move the ""stop"" block to the left, say to 1 step left and 3 step up, then the connection between ""wall is stop"" would be broken. That would remove the ""wall is stop"" rule, making walls no longer stop. Then, I could move through walls or push them. 

But to move the ""stop"" block, I need to be next to it. Let's say I'm at the position of the ""baba"" rule, which is 4 step left and 2 steps down. From there, moving up two steps would get me to the area of the ""wall is stop"" rule. But there's a wall at 4 step left and 3 step up, which is part of the wall object. Since walls are stop, I can't move through them. So this path is blocked. 

Alternative approach: Use the existing rules to your advantage. Since ""baba is you"", maybe you can manipulate other rules. For example, create a ""baba is win"" rule. The necessary text blocks are ""baba"", ""is"", and ""win"". The ""baba"" rule is at 4 step left and 2 steps down, ""is"" is at 3 step left and 2 steps down, and ""win"" is part of the ""key is win"" rule at 6,7,8 steps right and 4 up. 

To create ""baba is win"", you need to move the ""win"" block near the ""baba"" and ""is"" blocks. The ""win"" block is currently 6 steps right and 4 up, which is quite far from the left side where ""baba"" and ""is"" are. Moving the ""win"" block all the way to the left would require navigating past walls and other objects. 

The path from 6 right,4 up to 4 left,2 down is blocked by walls. For example, at 3 steps right and 3 up there's a wall, and other walls in between. So moving the ""win"" block leftwards seems difficult. 

Another idea: Since the key is win, maybe gaining the key makes you win. So focus on moving the key to a position where you can pick it up. But the key is at 7 steps right and 1 step up. To get there, you'd have to move right past walls. But walls are stop, so you can't. Unless you can move the walls by changing the ""wall is stop"" rule. 

If I break the ""wall is stop"" rule, then walls become movable. Then, I can push the walls out of the way to access the key. So the plan would be: 

1. Break the ""wall is stop"" rule by moving one of its components (e.g., ""stop"" block).
2. With walls no longer stop, push them aside to reach the key.
3. Pick up the key, which makes you win because ""key is win"".

Let's try to execute step 1. The ""stop"" block is at 2 step left and 3 step up. To move it, I need to be adjacent to it. The nearby objects are the ""is"" block at 3 step left and 3 step up, and the wall at 4 step left and 3 step up. If I can move left from the ""stop"" block's position, but there's a wall at 1 step left and 3 step up. Wait, no, the wall is at 4 step left and 3 step up. So from the ""stop"" block's position (2 left, 3 up), moving left would take me to 1 left, 3 up, which is empty? Or is there an object there? 

Looking at the objects: rule `stop` is at 2 left,3 up; rule `is` at 3 left,3 up; rule `wall` at 4 left,3 up. So to the left of ""stop"" is open. So if I can move the ""stop"" block left to 1 left,3 up, that would break the ""wall is stop"" rule. 

To move the ""stop"" block, I need to be adjacent to it. The ""stop"" block is at 2 left,3 up. Where is the player (BABA) located? The player is at the position of the ""baba"" rule, which is 4 step left and 2 steps down. From there, to reach the ""stop"" block at 2 left,3 up, the path would be: move up one step to 4 left,3 up (there's a wall there), so can't. Move left to 3 left,2 down (which is the ""is"" block), then up to 3 left,3 up (which is the ""is"" block), then left to 2 left,3 up (the ""stop"" block). So possible. 

So the steps would be: 

1. From baba's position (4 left,2 down), move up to 4 left,3 up (wall, can't).
Alternative path: move left to 3 left,2 down (is block), then up to 3 left,3 up (is block), then left to 2 left,3 up (stop block). 

But moving left from 3 left,3 up (is block) to 2 left,3 up (stop block) is possible if the is block is movable. Since ""is"" is part of a rule but not labeled as stop, it can be moved. So yes, I can move the is block out of the way. 

So the sequence would be: 

- Move from baba's position (4 left,2 down) to 3 left,2 down (is block) by moving left.
- Then move up to 3 left,3 up (still is block).
- Then move left to 2 left,3 up (stop block).

Once at the stop block, move it left to 1 left,3 up. This breaks the ""wall is stop"" rule. 

Once walls are no longer stop, I can push them. Then, navigate to the key by pushing walls out of the way. 

After breaking the ""wall is stop"" rule, the active rules are key is win and baba is you. Then, moving to the key at 7 right,1 up. But the path is clear now since walls can be pushed. 

So the chosen action would be to move left towards the ""stop"" block to break the rule. 

But the question is, what's the next immediate action? The observation shows that the ""stop"" block is at 2 step left and 3 step up. The player is at 4 step left and 2 steps down. To get to the ""stop"" block, the first move should be left from the player's position to 3 left,2 down (the ""is"" block), then up to 3 left,3 up (still ""is""), then left to 2 left,3 up (stop). Then move left again to move the stop block. 

But the action must be a single move. So the first action should be to move left from the player's position to reach the ""is"" block. 

Wait, the player's position is at the rule `baba` which is at 4 step left and 2 steps down. So the player is located there. To move left, the action would be ""left"". 

So the initial action is to move left, which would take the player from 4 left,2 down to 3 left,2 down, which is the ""is"" block. 

But the ""is"" block is part of a rule, but since it's not labeled as stop, it can be moved. So moving left is valid. 

After moving left, the next action would be to move up, then left again to reach the ""stop"" block. But since we can only choose one action, the first move is to move left. 

Therefore, the chosen action is ""left"".

Let's try to figure out what the next move should be here. The active rules are still ""key is win"", ""wall is stop"", and ""baba is you"". The goal is usually to reach the win object, which in this case is the key. But the key is set as the win condition, so grabbing it should solve the level.

Looking at the map layout, the player (Baba) is positioned at ""rule `baba` 1 step to the left and 2 steps down"". So I need to figure out where exactly Baba is located relative to the key. Let's break down the objects:

- The key is at 8 steps to the right and 1 step up from Baba's position.
- There are walls (marked as stop) around, so movement might be blocked unless those walls have their properties changed.

The current rules mean that walls are stop, so I can't move through them. But maybe I can rearrange the rules to make walls passable. For example, if I can change ""wall is stop"" to something else, like ""wall is push"" or ""wall is nothing"", then I could move around them.

Looking at the text blocks on the map, there are rules like ""wall is stop"" at 1 step to the left and 3 step up, and ""is"" and ""stop"" blocks nearby. If I can move the ""stop"" property away from ""wall"", then walls might no longer block movement. Alternatively, creating a new rule like ""baba is stop"" would be bad, but maybe ""baba is push"" or another property could help.

But the immediate goal is to get to the key. The key is directly to the right and up from Baba's current position. Let's check the path:

- Right 4 steps to get to the wall at 4 steps right. But wait, the key is at 8 steps right and 1 step up. So moving right multiple times, but there are walls in the way. For example, at 4 steps right, there's a wall, and similarly at 1 step up, there's another wall.

Alternatively, maybe moving up first. From Baba's position (1 left, 2 down), moving up would take him to 1 left, 1 down. But looking at the objects, there's a wall at 4 steps right and 1 step up. Not sure if that's in the way.

Wait, perhaps the key is blocked by walls, but if I can move the ""wall is stop"" rule, then those walls become passable. Let's see where the ""wall is stop"" rule is located. It's at 1 step to the left and 3 step up. So if I can move that text block, perhaps I can change the property of walls.

But to move a text block, I need to be adjacent to it and not be stopped by any ""stop"" properties. The player (Baba) is at 4 left and 2 steps down. Wait, the rule `baba` is at 4 step to the left and 2 steps down. So the player's position is 4 steps left and 2 steps down from the reference point? Or is the reference point the center?

This is a bit confusing. Maybe it's better to focus on moving towards the key while avoiding walls. But given the walls are everywhere, perhaps the solution is to manipulate the rules.

The key is set as win, so grabbing it should work. But to reach it, I need to move past the walls. If I can change the ""wall is stop"" rule to something else, like ""wall is push"" or remove it, then I can navigate around.

Looking at the objects, there's a ""rule `wall` 1 step to the left and 3 step up"" which defines wall as stop. If I can move that ""wall"" text block and the ""stop"" text block apart, then the rule ""wall is stop"" would be broken. For example, moving the ""stop"" to a different position so that it's not paired with ""wall"".

The player (Baba) is at 4 step to the left and 2 steps down. The ""rule `baba`"" is there. To reach the ""stop"" rule at 1 step to the left and 3 step up, I need to move left and up. But moving left from Baba's position would take him to 3 steps left, 2 steps down. Is there a path there?

Alternatively, moving the ""is"" block that's with the ""stop"" rule. The ""rule `is` 1 step to the left and 3 step up"" is next to ""stop"". If I can swap the ""stop"" with another ""is"", but I don't see another ""is"" nearby except the ones related to ""baba is you"".

This is getting complicated. Maybe the key is too far, and the real solution is to make Baba into the key or win. For example, changing ""baba is you"" to ""baba is win"", but that might not help. Alternatively, ""key is you"" so that stepping on the key makes you win.

Wait, the current rule is ""key is win"", so touching the key should make you win. So the problem must be reaching the key without being stopped by walls. The walls are at 4 steps right and various positions. So perhaps the path to the key is blocked by these walls, which are stop.

To move through walls, we need to change their property. The ""wall is stop"" rule is at 1 left, 3 up. If I can move that ""stop"" to another part of the rule, like making ""wall is push"" or removing ""stop"".

But to do that, I need to move the ""stop"" text block. The player is at 4 left, 2 down. The ""stop"" is at 1 left, 3 up. The distance is 3 steps left and 1 step up. But the player can't move through walls. Are there any passable paths?

From Baba's position (4 left, 2 down), moving left would reach 3 left, 2 down. Is there a wall there? Looking at the objects, there's a wall at 1 step to the right and 2 steps down, but that's in the opposite direction. Wait, the walls are positioned as per the observations. For example, ""wall 1 step to the right and 4 step up"" — maybe the coordinates are relative to the player's position.

This is getting too confusing. Maybe the best approach is to move towards the key while trying to rearrange the rules. Alternatively, since the key is the win object, maybe the solution is to push the key towards Baba by rearranging the ""door"" or other blocks, but I don't see a door in the current path.

Another idea: The ""door"" rule is at 7 steps right and 2 step up. Maybe using the door to exit, but the door's rule is present, so perhaps it's a locked door unless the key is used. But the key is the win condition, so maybe just grabbing the key is enough.

Wait, the active rules are ""key is win"", so if Baba touches the key, he wins. Therefore, the problem is getting to the key without being blocked by walls. The walls are stop, so movement into them is impossible. Therefore, the solution must involve moving the ""wall is stop"" rule out of place so that walls are no longer stop.

To do that, the player needs to move the ""stop"" text block away from the ""wall"" text block. The ""wall"" rule is at 1 step left and 3 step up, paired with ""is"" and ""stop"" at 1 step left and 3 step up. So the rule is ""wall IS stop"". To break this, we need to move either ""wall"", ""is"", or ""stop"" away.

The player is at 4 step left and 2 steps down. The ""stop"" is at 1 left, 3 up. The distance is 3 steps left and 1 step up from the player. To reach there, the player needs to move left and up, but there might be walls in between.

Looking at the objects:

- At 1 step right and 3 step up, there's a wall.
- At 4 step right and 3 step up, another wall.
- The path to the ""stop"" rule is blocked by these walls. So the player can't physically move there to move the ""stop"" block.

Alternative approach: Use other text blocks to create a new rule that allows passing through walls. For example, creating ""baba is push"" so that when pushing blocks, walls can be moved out of the way. But to create that rule, the player needs to have the necessary text blocks (baba, is, push) adjacent.

Looking at the current objects, there's a ""rule `baba` 4 step to the left and 2 steps down"" (the player's position), ""rule `is` 3 step to the left and 2 steps down"", and ""rule `you` 2 step to the left and 2 steps down"". So those are the ""baba"", ""is"", and ""you"" text blocks. Additionally, there are ""key"", ""win"", ""door"", and ""wall"" rules up higher.

If the player can move the ""baba"", ""is"", and another property like ""push"" together, they could create ""baba is push"". But where is the ""push"" text block? It doesn't seem to be present in the current objects. The available text blocks are key, win, door, wall, is, stop, you.

So maybe the solution is to reassign the ""stop"" property from walls to something else. For example, making ""stop is wall"" instead of ""wall is stop"", but that might not help. Or changing ""wall is stop"" to ""wall is key"", but that would make walls act like keys, which might not be useful.

Alternatively, create a new rule that makes Baba able to move through walls. For example, ""baba is not stop"". But without the ""not"" text block, that's not possible.

This is tricky. Maybe the intended solution is to realize that the key is the win condition, and by moving the ""key is win"" rule to make Baba the win. For example, moving ""baba"" next to ""win"" and ""is"" to create ""baba is win"". That way, Baba himself becomes the win condition, so touching any part of him would win the level.

To do that, the player needs to move the ""baba"" text block next to the ""win"" text block and the ""is"" text block. The ""baba"" rule is currently at 4 step left and 2 steps down. The ""win"" rule is at 9 steps right and 4 step up. That's quite far. Alternatively, the ""win"" rule is far to the right, but maybe there's a closer ""win"" instance? Wait, in the current observation, the ""win"" rule is at 6 steps right and 4 step up in an earlier observation, but now it's at 9 steps right. So it's moving each time the player moves, perhaps because the level is shifting.

Alternatively, maybe the key is being pushed towards Baba by rearranging other blocks. For example, using the ""door"" rule, but I'm not sure.

Another angle: The key is at 8 steps right and 1 step up from Baba's position. To get there, moving right 4 times and up 1 time. But there's a wall at 4 steps right and 3 step up, which is in the way. If walls are stop, the player can't pass through. So need to eliminate the wall's stop property.

The ""wall is stop"" rule is at 1 step left and 3 step up. To break this, the player needs to move either the ""wall"" or ""stop"" part away. But how?

If the player can move the ""stop"" block to another part of the rule. For example, moving ""stop"" to be part of a different rule, like ""door is stop"", but that's already the case if there's a ""door is stop"" rule. Looking at the objects, there's a ""rule `door` 5 steps to the right and 2 step up"", but no ""stop"" associated with it.

Alternatively, creating a new rule ""wall is key"" by moving ""wall"", ""is"", and ""key"" together. That way, walls become keys, which might be passable or lead to another solution.

But the player needs to have the ""key"" text block nearby. The key is at 8 steps right and 1 step up, which is quite far. The player is at 4 left, 2 down. Moving right 12 steps and up 3 steps seems impossible given the level's layout.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe the solution is to move towards the key and use the existing rules to bypass walls. For example, if the player can push a wall out of the way, but since walls are stop, they can't be pushed unless ""wall is push"".

Wait, if the player creates ""wall is push"", then they could move walls. But to do that, they need the ""push"" text block. Since there's no ""push"" in the current objects, that's not possible.

Alternative idea: The ""key is win"" rule means that if the player can make the key touch Baba, then Baba becomes win. But the key is separate. Alternatively, the player can move the ""key is win"" rule to make ""baba is win"". For example, moving the ""win"" part to Baba.

The ""key is win"" rule is at 6 steps right and 4 step up. The player is at 4 left, 2 down. To move the ""win"" block from the key to Baba, the player would need to navigate to that rule and rearrange the blocks. But the distance is significant, and there are walls in the way.

Perhaps the intended solution is to move left to reach the ""stop"" rule and rearrange it. The player is at 4 left, 2 down. The ""stop"" rule is at 1 left, 3 up. Moving left 3 steps and up 1 step would get there, but there might be walls blocking the path.

Looking at the objects again:

- At 1 step right and 3 step up: wall
- At 4 step right and 3 step up: wall
- The path to the ""stop"" rule (1 left, 3 up) is blocked by walls on the right side. So moving left and up from the player's position would require going through those walls, which are stop, hence impossible.

This suggests that the only way is to change the ""wall is stop"" rule. But how?

Wait, maybe the ""is"" block that's with the ""wall"" and ""stop"" can be moved. The ""rule `is` 1 step to the left and 3 step up"" is part of the ""wall is stop"" rule. If the player can move the ""is"" to connect another property, like making ""wall is key"" instead.

For example, moving the ""is"" block from between ""wall"" and ""stop"" to between ""wall"" and ""key"". That would create ""wall is key"", making walls act like keys. If keys are win, then walking through walls would be equivalent to walking through keys, which might be passable or trigger the win condition.

But to do that, the player needs to have the ""key"" text block nearby. The key is at 8 steps right and 1 step up, which is far away. The player can't reach it in one move.

Alternatively, use the existing ""key is win"" rule. If walls become keys, then touching a wall would be like touching a key, which is win. So the player could walk through walls.

But again, the player needs to rearrange the ""wall is stop"" rule into ""wall is key"". To do that, they need to move the ""is"" block from ""wall is stop"" to ""wall is key"".

The steps would be:

1. Move to the ""wall is stop"" rule location (1 left, 3 up).
2. Swap the ""stop"" with ""key"" by moving the ""is"" block.

But the player can't reach that location due to walls. So this seems impossible.

Another approach: Since the key is the win object, maybe the solution is to push the key towards Baba using other blocks. For example, if the player can push the key by moving adjacent blocks, but since the player is ""you"", and if ""baba is you"", then moving the key requires it to be pushable. But unless ""key is push"", which it's not, the key can't be pushed.

The key's rule is ""key is win"", so it's static unless moved by the player. But the player can move the key if it's not stop. Since the key isn't defined as stop (only walls are), the player can move the key.

Ah! Here's the key insight: The key is not a stop, so the player can move it. The active rules are ""wall is stop"" and ""key is win"". So the key can be picked up and carried.

So the plan is:

1. Move towards the key at 8 steps right and 1 step up.
2. Since the key isn't stop, the player can move it.
3. Carry the key to Baba's position, but the goal is just to touch the key, so maybe just move next to it.

But how to reach the key? The path is blocked by walls, but since the player can move the key, maybe they can move around the walls by carrying the key.

Wait, the player is ""you"", and if ""baba is you"", then moving the key requires the key to be movable. The key's rule is ""key is win"", so it's a static object unless moved. But in Baba Is You, you can move any object that isn't stopped by a ""stop"" rule. Since the key isn't stop, the player can move it.

So the steps could be:

- Move right towards the key, avoiding walls by moving around them, possibly using the key itself as a tool.
- Once the key is within reach, move it towards the player's position, but since touching the key is enough, maybe just move next to it.

But the player's current position is 4 left, 2 down. The key is at 8 right, 1 up. The distance is quite large, and there are walls in between. However, since the player can move the key, maybe they can use it to push walls out of the way.

For example, if a wall is in the path, the player can push the key towards the wall, and if the key can move through the wall (since walls are stop, but the key isn't), then the wall remains, but the key moves around it. Wait, no. The player can move the key, but the wall is stop, so moving the key into a wall would be blocked.

This is getting too complex. Maybe the intended solution is to realize that the key is the win condition, and by moving the ""key is win""","

Let's try to figure out what to do here. The active rules are ""key is win"", ""wall is stop"", and ""baba is you"". My goal is usually to reach the win condition, which right now is the key because of the ""key is win"" rule.

Looking at the objects on the map, the key is located at 8 steps to the right and 1 step up. But there's a wall at 4 steps to the right (same as my current position) blocking the path to the key. The wall is a stop, so I can't move through it. The ball is at 5 steps to the right and 3 steps up, but I'm not sure if that's useful yet.

The rules are scattered around. There's a ""rule `baba` 1 step to the left and 2 steps down"" which probably means I can move that text block. If I can rearrange the rules, maybe I can change what ""you"" refers to or make a new rule that allows me to pass walls. 

For example, if I can move the ""you"" rule to attach to baba, then I would become the you, but I'm already ""baba is you"", so maybe that's not necessary. Alternatively, if I can make a rule like ""baba is not stop"", then I could pass through walls. But how?

The door is at 7 steps to the right and 2 steps up, but it's labeled as a rule ""door"". Maybe the door is an object that can be opened if I have the key. Since the key is the win condition, grabbing it would probably open the door or make me win. But getting to the key is blocked by walls.

Looking at the text blocks, there's a ""rule `is`"" at various positions. If I can combine ""baba"", ""is"", and another property, maybe I can create a new rule. For instance, moving ""baba"" to the left two steps down next to ""is"" and ""not stop"" or something. Wait, but where is ""not stop""?

Looking at the current rules, there's ""stop"" at 1 step to the right and 3 step up. Maybe if I can create a rule like ""baba is not stop"", that would let me pass through walls. To do that, I need to move the ""baba"" rule, the ""is"" rule, and the ""not stop"" property. But ""not stop"" isn't a current rule. Hmm, maybe I need to rearrange existing rules.

Alternatively, the ""key is win"" rule makes the key the objective. If I can pick up the key, then according to the rule, that would make me win. But the key is behind walls. How to get past them?

Wait, the walls are stop, but if I can change the property of the wall, maybe to ""push"" or something, then I could move them. But there's no ""push"" rule here. Alternatively, if I can make myself ""push"", but I'm already ""baba is you"". Maybe combining rules?

Another angle: the ball is present. Sometimes in Baba games, objects like balls can be moved. But I don't see any rules about balls being movable or interactable here. The active rules only mention key, wall, and baba.

So, the immediate problem is reaching the key. To do that, I need to move the walls blocking the path. Since walls are stop, I can't push them unless there's a rule allowing it. But there's no such rule. Therefore, perhaps the solution is to rearrange the rules to create a new rule that allows me to pass walls.

Looking at the text blocks available:

- rule `baba` at 1 step to the left and 2 steps down
- rule `is` at 2 steps down
- rule `you` at 1 step to the right and 2 steps down

If I can move these together to form a new rule, like ""baba is not stop"", that would solve the problem. To do that, I need to bring the ""baba"" rule next to ""is"" and then next to ""not stop"". But ""not stop"" isn't a separate text block here. The existing rules are ""stop"" at 2 step to the left and 3 step up. Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at 2 step to the left and 3 step up. Maybe I can move that ""stop"" rule and negate it?

Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to use the existing ""key is win"" rule to your advantage. Since the key is the win, maybe picking it up automatically makes you win, but you can't reach it because of the walls. So the solution must involve changing the rules to bypass the walls.

Another thought: the ""door"" is a rule at 7 steps to the right and 2 steps up. Maybe the door needs to be opened with the key. If I can get the key, then the door would be accessible, leading to the win. But again, the path is blocked by walls.

So, the key steps are:

1. Move the walls blocking the path to the key.
2. Create a rule that allows passing through walls or makes the player non-stop.

To create such a rule, I need to manipulate the existing text blocks. Let's look at the positions:

- rule `baba` is 1 step to the left and 2 steps down from the player's current position (assuming player is at 4 steps right, based on the latest observation).
- rule `is` is 2 steps down.
- rule `you` is 1 step to the right and 2 steps down.

If I move the ""baba"" rule to the left, combine it with ""is"" and then with ""not stop"", but ""not stop"" isn't present. Alternatively, use the existing ""stop"" rule and negate it.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at 2 step to the left and 3 step up. If I can move that ""stop"" rule and pair it with ""is not"", but there's no ""is not"" rule. Alternatively, rearrange ""baba is you"" to ""baba is not stop"".

To do that, I need to move the ""baba"" rule, the ""is"" rule, and the ""not stop"" property. But ""not stop"" isn't a separate block. Maybe ""stop"" is a property, so ""not stop"" would be creating a negation.

Alternatively, since the ""key is win"" rule is present, maybe picking up the key is enough. But the path is blocked. So perhaps the solution is to remove the wall rule. If I can move the ""wall is stop"" rule apart and replace it with something else.

The ""wall is stop"" rule is at 1 step to the left and 3 step up. If I can move the ""wall"" text block away, and then apply a different property to it, like ""wall is push"" or ""wall is nothing"", that would help. But how?

Alternatively, create a rule like ""baba can move through walls"" by combining the existing rules. For example, moving ""baba"" next to ""is"" and then next to ""move through walls"", but that text isn't present.

This is tricky. Let's think step by step.

Current player position: Assuming the player is at the position of ""baba"", which in the latest observation is at 4 steps to the right and 2 steps down (since rule `baba` is 4 step to the left and 2 steps down from somewhere? Wait, the observation says ""rule `baba` 4 step to the left and 2 steps down"". So the player is at 4 steps left and 2 steps up from the rule `baba` position. Hmm, maybe the coordinate system is relative. This is getting confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the player is at the starting position, and the objects are listed relative to the player. For example, ""wall 2 steps to the right"" means two steps to the right of the player.

In the latest observation, the player (Baba) is at a position where rule `baba` is 4 steps to the left and 2 steps down. So the player's position is 4 steps right and 2 steps up from where the `baba` rule text block is.

The key is at 8 steps to the right and 1 step up from the player's position. But there's a wall at 4 steps to the right (player's position) and 1 step up, which is the wall blocking the direct path.

To reach the key, the player needs to move right past the wall. But since the wall is a stop, movement is blocked. So the player must either move the wall, which requires a rule allowing it, or change the player's property to not be stop.

Given the available text blocks, the player can try to create a new rule like ""baba is not stop"". To do this, they need to move the `baba` rule, `is`, and `not stop` together. However, `not stop` isn't an existing rule. The closest is the `stop` rule at 2 steps left and 3 steps up. Maybe negating that?

Alternatively, use the existing `stop` rule and move it somewhere else, then create a new rule. For example, moving `wall is stop` apart and then creating `baba is not stop`.

But how to form the new rule? The player needs to place `baba`, `is`, and `not stop` in sequence. Since `not stop` isn't present, perhaps combining `stop` with a negation. But the game doesn't have a negation text block by default. So this might not be possible.

Another approach: The key is the win condition. If the player can pick up the key, then according to the rule `key is win`, that would make the player win. But the key is behind walls. So the player must move the walls or make themselves able to pass through them.

Perhaps the solution is to push the wall. But walls are stop, so you can't push them unless there's a rule allowing it. Since there's no such rule, this isn't possible.

Wait, maybe the door at 7 steps right and 2 steps up is relevant. If the player can reach the door with the key, then the door opens. But again, blocked by walls.

Alternatively, the ball at 5 steps right and 3 steps up. Maybe pushing the ball? But there's no rule allowing baba to push objects.

This is quite challenging. Let's recap the possible actions:

1. Move towards the key, but blocked by walls.
2. Rearrange rules to create a new rule that allows passing walls or changes the player's property.
3. Use existing rules creatively.

The most promising is rearranging rules. The player has the `baba`, `is`, and `you` rules nearby. If they can create `baba is not stop`, they can pass through walls.

To do that, they need to move the `baba` rule, the `is` rule, and then a `not stop` property. Since `not stop` isn't present, maybe using the existing `stop` rule and moving it to form `is not stop`?

Alternatively, since the `stop` rule is at 2 steps left and 3 steps up, the player could move that `stop` rule next to `baba` and `is` to create `baba is not stop`. But how?

Wait, maybe the player can move the `stop` rule to a different position and then form a new rule. For example, move the `stop` rule to be after `baba is`, making `baba is stop` into `baba is not stop` by rearranging. But I'm not sure if the game allows negation like that.

Alternatively, if the player can create a rule `not stop is key` or something, but that doesn't make sense.

Another idea: The `key is win` rule makes the key the target. If the player can make themselves the key, then they would automatically win. To do that, create `baba is key`. But the key is at 8 steps right and 1 step up. How to create that rule?

The player needs to move the `baba` rule, `is`, and `key` together. The `key` rule is at 7 steps right and 4 steps up. So the player would need to move those text blocks adjacent to each other.

But the player's current position is such that moving up to reach the `key` rule might be possible. Let's check the positions:

In the latest observation, the player (Baba) is at a position where the `baba` rule is 4 steps to the left and 2 steps down. So the player is at:

- x: 4 steps right (since `baba` is 4 left)
- y: 2 steps up (since `baba` is 2 down)

The `key` rule is at 7 steps right and 4 steps up from the player's position. So to reach the `key` rule, the player would need to move right 7 steps and up 4, but there are walls blocking the path.

Alternatively, move the `key` rule to the player's position by pushing it, but the player can't push unless there's a rule allowing it.

This seems stuck. Maybe the solution is to move the `wall is stop` rule away and replace it with a different rule. For example, move the `wall` text block, the `is` text block, and then a different property like `nothing` or `push`.

But the available text blocks don't include `nothing` or `push`. The closest is `door` and `ball`, but those aren't properties.

Wait, the `door` is a rule at 7 steps right and 2 steps up. Maybe creating a rule like `door is win`? But the active rule is `key is win`, so that might not help unless the door can be opened with the key.

Alternatively, create `baba is door` to become the door, but that doesn't make sense.

Hmm. Maybe the key is not necessary if the player can change the win condition. For example, change `key is win` to `baba is win`. But to do that, the player needs to move the `win` rule and attach it to `baba`.

The `win` rule is at 9 steps right and 4 steps up. The player would need to move that down to their position. But again, movement is blocked by walls.

This is really challenging. Let's think of the possible moves the player can make based on the current observation.

The player's current position is such that they can move in directions, but movement is blocked by walls. The nearby text blocks are:

- `baba` rule: 4 left, 2 down
- `is` rule: 2 down
- `you` rule: 1 right, 2 down

If the player moves left twice, they can reach the `baba` rule. Then, they can pick it up and move it to combine with `is` and another property. For example, moving `baba` to the left, then `is` to the left, and then `not stop` (but where is `not stop`?).

Alternatively, since there's a `stop` rule at 2 left and 3 up, maybe the player can move `stop` to create a negation.

Wait, the `stop` rule is at 2 steps left and 3 steps up from the player's position. If the player moves down to that area, they could rearrange the `stop` rule with `baba` and `is` to form `baba is not stop`.

Here's a possible path:

1. Move left to reach the `baba` rule (4 left, 2 down from player's position? Need to clarify coordinates).
2. Pick up `baba` rule and move it next to `is` and `stop`.
3. Rearrange them to form `baba is not stop`.

But the exact movement steps need to be calculated. Assuming the player can move left, up, etc., to reach the necessary text blocks.

Alternatively, the player can move the `stop` rule to a new position and then create the desired rule.

This is quite complex. Given the time I've spent and the previous failures, perhaps the correct action now is to move right towards the key, hoping that the walls have moved or that there's a different configuration. But based on the observations, the walls are consistently blocking the path.

Another possibility: The player can push the wall if there's a rule allowing it. Since there's no such rule, this isn't possible. So the only way is to change the player's property to not be stop.

Given that, the correct action is to move the `baba`, `is`, and `not stop` (or equivalent) text blocks together. Since `not stop` isn't present, perhaps using the existing `stop` rule and moving it to form a negation.

In the latest observation, the `stop` rule is at 2 step to the left and 3 step up. If the player moves down to that area, they can pick up the `stop` rule and move it next to `baba` and `is` to form `baba is not stop`.

So the steps would be:

1. Move left to reach the `stop` rule.
2. Pick up `stop` and move it next to `baba` and `is`.
3. Combine them to create `baba is not stop`.

But how to translate this into a single action? The player needs to move in the direction of the `stop` rule.

In the current observation, the `stop` rule is 2 steps left and 3 steps up from the player's position. So the player needs to move left 2 times and up 3 times. However, each move is one step at a time.

But the player can't move diagonally, only up, down, left, right. So the path would be left, left, up, up, up.

However, the player's movement might be blocked by walls. For example, moving left from the player's current position (assuming they are at the position relative to the `baba` rule), there might be walls in the way.

Alternatively, the player can move towards the `is` rule, which is 2 steps down, and then combine it with `baba` and `stop`.

This is getting too vague. Given the time constraints, perhaps the best action now is to move right towards the key, hoping that the walls have changed, but based on previous observations, they haven't. So maybe the correct action is to move left to access the text blocks needed to create the new rule.

Alternatively, since the `key is win` rule is present, and the key is at 8 steps right and 1 step up, the player needs to get there. But the only way is to move through the walls, which requires changing the rule.

Given all this, the chosen action is to move left to reach the text blocks needed to create the desired rule. However, without knowing the exact coordinates, it's","

Let's try to figure out how to solve this Baba Is You level. The active rules right now are key is win, wall is stop, and baba is you. My goal is usually to reach the win object, which in this case is the key because of the rule ""key is win"". But the key is located at 5 steps to the right and 1 step up from my current position. The problem is that there are walls blocking the path. Let me look at the map again.

Looking at the objects, there's a wall 4 steps to the right and 4 steps up. Then there are rules for key, is, win all lined up to the right. The ball is at 5 steps right and 3 up, which might be a distraction. The door is at 7 steps right and 2 up, but I'm not sure if that's relevant yet. The key is at 8 steps right and 1 step up, so pretty far down.

The walls are all defined as stop, so I can't move through them. Since I'm Baba, and the rule is ""baba is you"", I can move around but can't go through walls. The key is to the right and below me, but there's a wall directly below at 4 steps right and 1 step up. Then the key is one more step right and down. Wait, the key is at 8 steps right and 1 step up, which is four steps to the right and one step up from the wall at 4 steps right and 1 step up. So maybe I need to move around the walls.

But how? The only way to manipulate the rules is to move the text blocks. The rule ""key is win"" is at 7,8,9 steps right and 4 up. If I can move that, maybe I can change what's win. But to do that, I need to pick up the ""key"" text block, which is at 7 steps right and 4 up. But to get there, I have to navigate through the walls. The path to the key's rule is blocked by walls. Let me see.

My current position isn't specified in the observation, but assuming I'm starting at Baba's position, which is at 4 steps left and 2 steps down according to the rule blocks. Wait, the rule `baba` is at 1 step to the left and 2 steps down from the wall. So if the wall is at 4 steps right and 4 up, then rule `baba` is at 4-1=3 steps right and 4 -2=2 up? Wait, the observation says ""rule `baba` 4 step to the left and 2 steps down"". So if the reference point is the wall at 4 steps right and 4 up, then rule `baba` is 4 steps left from that wall's x-coordinate and 2 steps down from its y-coordinate. So the wall is at (4,4), rule `baba` is at (4-4=0, 4-2=2). So Baba's position is at (0,2). 

Now, the key is at (8,1). The path from (0,2) to (8,1) is to the right and down, but there are walls blocking. Let's check the walls:

- At (4,4): wall
- At (4,3): wall
- At (4,2): wall
- At (4,1): wall
- At (4,0): wall
- Then at (4,-1): wall
- Also, there's a rule `door` at (7,2), which might be movable.

So moving right from Baba's position (0,2), the first obstacle is at (4,2), which is a wall. To get past that, I need to either move around it or change the rules. But moving around would require going up or down, but the walls are also at (4,3), (4,1), etc. So maybe the only way is to manipulate the rules to make the walls not stop me.

The active rules are wall is stop. If I can change that rule, maybe to wall is not stop, then I could pass through walls. To do that, I need to move the ""wall"" text block. The rule ""wall is stop"" is at (3,3) relative to some point? Wait, the observation says rule `wall` is at 4 step to the left and 3 step up from somewhere. Wait, the exact positions are:

- rule `wall` 4 step to the left and 3 step up: assuming this is relative to another object. Looking at the objects, the first rule mentioned is ""key is win"" at 4 steps right and 4 up. Maybe the rule `wall` is 4 steps left from that position? So the key's rule is at (4,4), then rule `wall` is at (4-4=0,4+3=7)? That doesn't make sense. Maybe the positions are absolute. Wait, the observation lists objects with their positions relative to the player? Or is it a grid?

This is a bit confusing. Let me try to parse the objects' positions again. The observation says:

Objects on the map:
wall 1 step to the right and 4 step up
rule `key` 4 steps to the right and 4 step up
rule `is` 5 steps to the right and 4 step up
rule `win` 6 steps to the right and 4 step up
rule `wall` 4 step to the left and 3 step up
rule `is` 3 step to the left and 3 step up
rule `stop` 2 step to the left and 3 step up
... and so on.

Assuming that each object's position is relative to the player's current position. So if the player is at (0,0), then:

- wall is at (1,4)
- rule `key` is at (4,4)
- rule `is` at (5,4)
- rule `win` at (6,4)
- rule `wall` at (-4,3) (4 steps left)
- rule `is` at (-3,3)
- rule `stop` at (-2,3)
- wall at (1,3)
- ball at (2,3)
- etc.

So the grid is from, say, x=-4 to x=9 (since the farthest right is rule `win` at 6 steps right, which is x=6) and y from 0 to 4 (since the highest is 4 steps up at y=4).

Baba's position is at the rule `baba` which is at 4 step to the left and 2 steps down from somewhere. Looking at the objects, rule `baba` is listed as:

rule `baba` 4 step to the left and 2 steps down

Assuming this is relative to another object. The previous rule is rule `you` at 2 step to the left and 2 steps down. So perhaps rule `baba` is 4 steps left and 2 down from rule `you`? That would place rule `baba` at (2-4= -2, 2-2=0). But this is getting complicated. Alternatively, maybe all positions are absolute. For example, if the player is at (0,0), then:

- rule `baba` is at (-4, -2)
- rule `is` at (-3, -2)
- rule `you` at (-2, -2)

But this is unclear. Maybe the positions are all relative to the starting point. This is a bit confusing without a visual map. 

Alternatively, perhaps the key is to move the text blocks to change the rules. For example, if I can move the ""stop"" property from ""wall"" to something else, then walls wouldn't block. But to do that, I need to grab the ""stop"" text block which is at (-2,3) (if the positions are relative to Baba). Then move it to another object, like making ""rule `wall` IS notstop"" or something. But how?

The active rules are key is win, wall is stop, baba is you. So to reach the key (which is win), I need to get past the walls. The walls are at x=1,4,5,6,7,8 on y=1,2,3,4. Wait, no, looking at the objects:

- wall at (1,4)
- wall at (1,3)
- wall at (1,2)
- wall at (1,1)
- wall at (1,0)
- wall at (1,-1)
- Also, wall at (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (4,0), (4,-1), and others.

So the walls form a structure to the right and above. The key is at (8,1). To get there, I need to move right past x=4, but all those x=4 positions are blocked by walls except y=2. Wait, at x=4, y=2 there's a wall, but maybe I can go around it by moving up or down. But looking at the map:

At x=4, y=4: wall
y=3: wall
y=2: wall
y=1: wall
y=0: wall
y=-1: wall

So the entire vertical line x=4 from y=-1 to y=4 is blocked. The only way through is to go around to the left or right, but x=4 is a solid wall. Therefore, the only way is to manipulate the rules to remove the stop property from walls.

The rule ""wall is stop"" is present. If I can change this rule to something else, like ""wall is push"" or ""wall is you"", then walls wouldn't stop me. To do that, I need to move the ""stop"" text block. The ""stop"" rule is at (-2,3) (assuming positions relative to Baba at (0,0)). To move it, I have to be adjacent to it and move in a direction that carries it with me, since only non-stop objects can be moved.

Baba is you, so I can move. The ""stop"" object is at (-2,3), which is two steps to the left and three steps up from Baba's position (0,0). To get there, I need to move left and up. But the path might be blocked. Let's see:

From (0,0), moving left to (-1,0), then (-2,0), which is the position of the ""stop"" rule? Wait, no. The ""stop"" rule is at 2 steps to the left and 3 steps up from somewhere. If it's relative to another object, like the ""rule `is`"" at (-3,3), then ""stop"" is 2 steps left and 3 up from that. So (-3-2=-5, 3+3=6)? That doesn't make sense. This is getting too confusing without a visual.

Alternatively, maybe the ""stop"" rule is at (-2,3) relative to Baba. So to reach it, I need to move left twice and up three times. But can I pass through other objects? The walls at x=1,4, etc., but I'm at x=0,y=0. Moving left to x=-1,y=0: is there a wall there? According to the objects listed, the walls are at x=1,4,5,6,7,8 on various y's. So x=-1,y=0 is probably empty. So I can move left and up.

So the plan is: move to the ""stop"" rule, then move it to change the wall's property. For example, change ""wall is stop"" to ""wall is you"", making walls into you, so I can walk through them. Then go around the walls to the key.

Alternatively, change ""key is win"" to something else, but the key is the win object. Wait, the rule is ""key is win"", so the win condition is the key. So I need to reach the key. But the key is behind walls. So changing the rules to make walls not stop me seems better.

To do that, I need to move the ""stop"" text block. The ""stop"" rule is part of ""wall is stop"". So if I can rearrange that rule to ""wall is [something else]"", then walls won't block. For example, ""wall is push"" or ""wall is you"".

To move the ""stop"" text block, I need to be adjacent to it and move in a direction that carries it. Since I'm Baba (you), and the ""stop"" block is a property, I can pick it up if it's not attached to a rule. Wait, the ""stop"" is part of the rule ""wall is stop"". So the rule is made of three text blocks: ""wall"", ""is"", ""stop"". To change the rule, I need to move one of these blocks. 

For example, to change ""wall is stop"" to ""wall is push"", I can move the ""stop"" block to ""push"". But where is ""push"" located? The observation doesn't mention a ""push"" rule, so it's probably not on the map. Therefore, I need to create a new rule by combining existing text blocks. 

Looking at the available text blocks:

From the objects listed:
- rule `key` at (4,4)
- rule `is` at (5,4), (3,3), (2,-2), etc.
- rule `win` at (6,4)
- rule `wall` at (-4,3)
- rule `stop` at (-2,3)
- rule `door` at (7,2)
- rule `baba` at (-4, -2)
- rule `you` at (-2, -2)

So the available text blocks are ""key"", ""is"", ""win"", ""wall"", ""stop"", ""door"", ""baba"", ""you"". 

To create a new rule like ""wall is push"", I need the ""wall"", ""is"", and ""push"" blocks. But ""push"" isn't present. Alternatively, change ""stop"" to something else. For example, ""wall is you"" would make walls into you, so I can walk through them. To do that, I need to move the ""stop"" block to ""you"". 

The ""you"" block is at (-2, -2). So if I can move the ""stop"" block from (-2,3) to (-2,-2), combining with ""is"" and ""wall"" to form ""wall is you"". 

To move the ""stop"" block, I need to be adjacent to it. From Baba's position at (0,0), the ""stop"" block is at (-2,3), which is two steps left and three steps up. So I need to move left twice and up three times. But the path might be blocked. Let's see:

From (0,0) → left to (-1,0) → left to (-2,0) → up to (-2,1) → up to (-2,2) → up to (-2,3). Is there any wall along this path? The walls are at x=1,4, etc., so the path to x=-2 is clear. So yes, I can move there.

Once at (-2,3) (the ""stop"" block), I can move it. Since ""stop"" is a property, moving it would require picking it up. But how? In Baba Is You, you can move text blocks that are not part of an active rule or are part of a rule you can break. Since ""stop"" is part of the active rule ""wall is stop"", moving it would require breaking that rule. To break the rule, you can push the ""is"" or ""wall"" or ""stop"" blocks apart.

Alternatively, to create a new rule, I can move the ""stop"" block next to ""wall"" and ""is"" to form a new rule. For example, moving ""stop"" to after ""wall is"", making ""wall is stop"" into ""wall is you"" by replacing ""stop"" with ""you"".

But this requires precise movement. Let's think step by step:

1. Move from Baba's position (0,0) to the ""stop"" block at (-2,3).
   - Move left twice: left, left.
   - Move up three times: up, up, up.

2. Once at (-2,3), the ""stop"" block is here. Now, I need to move it next to ""wall"" and ""is"" to form ""wall is you"".

The ""wall"" block is at (-4,3), and the ""is"" block is at (-3,3). So the current rule ""wall is stop"" is formed by ""wall"" (-4,3), ""is"" (-3,3), ""stop"" (-2,3).

To change this to ""wall is you"", I need to replace ""stop"" with ""you"". The ""you"" block is at (-2,-2).

So the plan is:

- Move the ""stop"" block from (-2,3) to where the ""you"" block is at (-2,-2). But that's a distance of five steps down. Alternatively, move the ""you"" block up to (-2,3), but the ""you"" block is at (-2,-2), so moving it up five steps would require a path.

Alternatively, rearrange the existing blocks. The ""is"" block is at (-3,3). If I can move the ""stop"" block to after the ""is"", and bring the ""you"" block next to it.

But this is getting complicated. Maybe a better approach is to first reach the ""stop"" block, then move it to adjacent ""wall"" and ""is"" to form the new rule.

Alternatively, since the ""you"" block is at (-2,-2), which is two steps down and two steps left from Baba's position. Maybe I can first go to the ""you"" block, then combine it with ""wall"" and ""is"" to make ""wall is you"".

So steps:

1. Move from (0,0) to ""you"" at (-2,-2):
   - Left twice: left, left.
   - Down twice: down, down.

2. Now at (-2,-2) with the ""you"" block. Need to bring ""wall"" and ""is"" here.

The ""wall"" block is at (-4,3), and ""is"" is at (-3,3). To get them to (-2,-2), that's a long way. Maybe this isn't efficient.

Alternatively, focus on changing the ""stop"" block to ""you"" in the existing rule.

Another idea: The key is at (8,1), and the door is at (7,2). If I can push the door open, but the rule for the door isn't specified. The door might","

Let's see. The active rules are key is win, wall is stop, and baba is you. So right now, touching a key makes you the win, walls are things I can't pass through, and since Baba is You, I am Baba and can move around like Baba.

Looking at the objects, there's a ball at position 5 steps right and 3 steps up. The key is even further right at 8 steps right and 1 step up. The door is at 7 steps right and 2 steps up. The walls are all aligned to the right and some upwards. 

The goal seems to be getting to the key because key is win. But how? The path to the key is blocked by walls. Let me check the map again. From my current position, which I assume is the starting point, I need to move towards the key. But all the way to the right there are walls. Maybe there's a way to break the wall rules or move them.

The rules for wall are at 1 step left and 3 step up. If I can move that wall rule, maybe I can remove the stop property from walls. But wait, to move a rule, I need to be able to move objects that aren't stopped. Right now, walls are stop, so I can't move them. But maybe I can move other text blocks.

Looking at the rules: key is win, wall is stop, baba is you. If I can create a new rule that changes wall to not stop, I could pass through walls. For example, if I can make ""wall is not stop"" by rearranging the existing text blocks. The rule ""wall is stop"" is present at 1 step left and 3 step up. If I can move that rule and change it, but how?

Alternatively, maybe I can use the ""baba is you"" to become something else. If I can make Baba into the key, then stepping on the key would make me win. But how to create that rule? The key is at 8 steps right and 1 step up, and there's a rule ""key is win"" at 7 steps right and 4 step up. Maybe I can move the ""key is win"" rule and change it to ""baba is key"" or something.

Wait, but to move the rules, I need to be able to move the text blocks. Since I'm Baba (because baba is you), and walls are stop, I can't move walls, but maybe I can move other objects. The ball is there; can I move the ball? It's not defined as stop, so maybe. But how does moving the ball help? Maybe not directly.

Alternatively, if I can reach the ""wall is stop"" rule and change it. Let's see where that rule is. It's at 1 step left and 3 step up. My current position isn't specified, but assuming I'm starting somewhere, maybe I need to navigate to that rule. But moving left from where I am? If I'm to the left of the wall rule, moving left would take me towards it, but walls are stop. Wait, if I'm Baba and walls are stop, I can't move into walls. So maybe I need to find a path around.

Alternatively, perhaps I can move the ""is"" or ""stop"" text blocks to form a new rule. For example, if I take the ""stop"" rule and combine it with ""wall"" to make ""wall is not stop"". But how to do that? I need to be able to pick up the ""stop"" text block and place it somewhere else.

Looking at the objects, there's a rule `stop` at 1 step to the left and 3 step up. If I can move that, maybe I can create a new rule. But to move it, I have to be able to move it without hitting a wall. If I'm near that rule, I could move left to get to it. But again, walls are stop, so moving left might be blocked.

Wait, the current active rules are key is win, wall is stop, and baba is you. So as Baba, I can move, but can't pass through walls. The key is to the far right, blocked by walls. The door is at 7 steps right and 2 steps up, which might be a way through if I can open it. But how?

The door's rule is ""door is ..."", but looking at the objects, the rule `door` is at 7 steps right and 2 step up. There's no active rule defining door's property, so maybe it's passable by default. If I can reach the door, maybe I can go through it. But the path to the door is blocked by walls at 4 steps right and 3 step up, etc.

Alternatively, maybe I can turn myself into the door. If I can create a rule ""baba is door"", then stepping on the door would make me win. But how to do that? I need to find the ""door"" rule and combine it with ""baba"" and ""is"".

The rule `door` is at 7 steps right and 2 step up. The `is` rule is at various positions. If I can move the `door` rule, `is` rule, and `baba` rule together to form ""baba is door"", that could work. But moving all those requires navigating through the map without hitting walls.

This is getting complicated. Let's try to outline steps:

1. Move towards the key at 8 right, 1 up. But path is blocked by walls. Need to remove wall stop property.

2. To remove wall stop, need to alter the ""wall is stop"" rule. To do that, find the ""wall is stop"" rule at 1 left, 3 up. Move the ""wall"" part, ""is"", and ""stop"" parts to form a new rule like ""wall is not stop"".

3. To move these text blocks, need to be able to move them. Since I'm Baba (you), and walls are stop, I can't move walls, but maybe I can move other text blocks if they're not stopped. The ""key"", ""is"", ""win"", ""wall"", ""stop"", ""door"" rules are all text blocks. Are they stop? The ""stop"" rule defines walls as stop, but other objects like text blocks might not be stop unless specified. So maybe I can move the text blocks.

So, if I can reach the ""wall is stop"" rule and rearrange it, I can change the rules. Let's say I move the ""stop"" text block to another position, creating a new rule. For example, moving ""wall"" to ""not stop"" by combining with ""is"".

Alternatively, create ""wall is lose"" or something else. But the goal is to make walls passable.

Alternatively, make ""baba is stop"" which would make me a wall, but that's counterproductive.

Alternatively, make ""you is win"" so that just being you makes you win. Since ""baba is you"", that would mean Baba is win. But the active rule is ""key is win"", so maybe not.

Wait, the current active rules are ""key is win"", so you have to be the key to win. But if I can change the rule to ""baba is win"", then just being Baba (you) would make me win. How to do that?

To do that, I need to create a new rule ""baba is win"" by moving the existing ""win"" text block. The ""win"" rule is at 9 steps right and 4 step up. The ""baba"" rule is at 1 step left and 2 steps down. The ""is"" rule is at various places.

So, if I can move the ""baba"" rule, ""is"", and ""win"" rule together to form ""baba is win"", that would work. Let's see where those are located.

Rule `baba` is at 1 step left and 2 steps down. Rule `is` is at 3 step left and 2 steps down. Rule `win` is at 9 steps right and 4 step up. That's quite far apart. Need to move these pieces.

But to move them, I have to navigate through the map. Starting from wherever I am, maybe I need to go left to get to the ""baba"" and ""is"" rules, then right to get to the ""win"" rule. But the path might be blocked by walls.

Alternatively, maybe there's a shorter path. Let me visualize the map.

Assuming the player is initially at position (0,0), let's consider positions relative to that.

- Wall at 1 right,4 up: (1,4)
- rule `key` at (4,4)
- rule `is` at (5,4)
- rule `win` at (6,4)
- rule `wall` at (-1,3)
- rule `is` at (-2,3)
- rule `stop` at (-1,3)
- wall at (1,3)
- ball at (2,3)
- etc.

This is getting too abstract. Maybe the key is to reach the ""key is win"" rule and change it to ""baba is win"". But how?

Alternatively, pick up the ""win"" text block and attach it to ""baba"" using an ""is"" rule. For example, move the ""baba"" rule, ""is"", and ""win"" to form ""baba is win"".

But the problem is moving through the map. The walls are blocking the path. Maybe I need to first remove the wall stop property by altering the ""wall is stop"" rule.

To do that, I need to get to the ""wall is stop"" rule at (-1,3). If I can move left from my current position, but there's a wall at (1,3) which is a stop. So moving left from (0,0) to (-1,3) would require passing through (1,3) which is a wall. Can't do that.

Alternative approach: Use the ball. The ball is at (2,3). If I can move the ball, maybe it can push a wall? But the ball isn't defined as any special property, so maybe I can move it. But how does moving the ball help?

Alternatively, create a new rule that makes the ball a stop, so pushing it into a wall would block the path. Not sure.

Alternatively, make the door passable by creating a rule like ""door is you"", but the door's rule is already there. Not sure.

This is tricky. Maybe the solution is to move towards the key and find a way to pass the walls by changing the rules. Since the key is win, maybe just reaching the key is enough once the rule is changed. But how to change the rule?

Wait, the active rules are key is win, wall is stop, baba is you. If I can create a new rule that says ""baba is key"", then since I'm Baba, I would be the key, making me win. To do that, I need to combine the ""baba"" rule, ""is"", and ""key"" rule into ""baba is key"".

The ""baba"" rule is at (-1,2), ""is"" is at (-2,3), and ""key"" is at (4,4). That's a bit far, but maybe possible.

Alternatively, maybe there's a closer ""is"" rule. Looking at the objects, there's an ""is"" at (5,4) near the key. So if I can get the ""baba"" rule, ""is"" from (5,4), and ""key"" from (4,4), rearrange them to make ""baba is key"".

To do that, I need to move these three text blocks. Let's see their positions:

- rule `baba`: (-1,2)
- rule `is`: (5,4)
- rule `key`: (4,4)

So from my current position (assuming I'm starting at, say, (0,0)), moving left to (-1,2) to get the baba rule, then right to (5,4) to get the is rule, then right to (4,4) to get the key rule. But the path might be blocked by walls.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the is rule from (5,4) to between baba and key. For example, move left from (5,4) to (4,4) to get the key, then to (3,4), etc., but walls are present.

This is getting too complicated. Perhaps the optimal action is to move right towards the key, hoping that eventually, by altering the rules, the path clears. But the previous attempts resulted in failures, so maybe a different approach is needed.

Another idea: Since key is win, maybe I can pick up the key and move it next to me. But how? The key is at (8,1). To get there, I need to move right multiple times, but walls are blocking. For example, at (4,4) there's a wall, so moving right from (4,4) would hit a wall.

Wait, the walls are at various positions. Let me list them:

- (1,4): wall
- (4,3): wall
- (2,3): wall
- (4,2): wall
- (4,1): wall
- (4,0): wall
- (4,-1): wall
- (4,-2): wall

So the path to the right is blocked by walls starting at (4,4) down to (4,-2). The key is at (8,1), which is far to the right beyond these walls. So unless I can remove the wall stop property, I can't get past them.

Therefore, the solution must involve altering the ""wall is stop"" rule. To do that, I need to move the ""wall"", ""is"", and ""stop"" text blocks to form a new rule.

The ""wall is stop"" rule is at (-1,3) with ""wall"" at (-1,3), ""is"" at (-2,3), and ""stop"" at (-1,3). Wait, no, looking back:

The rule `wall` is at 4 step to the left and 3 step up: so (-4,3)? Wait, the observation says:

""rule `wall` 4 step to the left and 3 step up""

Assuming each ""step"" is a grid movement, so if I'm at position (0,0), then:

rule `wall` is at (-4,3)

rule `is` is at (-5,3)

rule `stop` is at (-3,3)

Then the wall objects are at various positions like (1,4), (4,3), etc.

So the ""wall is stop"" rule is composed of three text blocks: ""wall"" at (-4,3), ""is"" at (-5,3), and ""stop"" at (-3,3). To change this to ""wall is not stop"", I need to replace ""stop"" with ""not stop"". But how?

Alternatively, create a new rule ""wall is [something else]"". For example, ""wall is push"" or ""wall is you"". But to do that, I need to rearrange the text blocks.

The ""not"" text block isn't present, so maybe I can't negate it directly. Alternatively, use ""no"" or another word, but I don't see that in the objects.

Alternatively, make ""wall is door"", so walls act like doors. If doors are passable, then I can go through walls. But there's no rule defining door's property, so maybe they are passable.

But how to create ""wall is door""? Need to move the ""wall"", ""is"", and ""door"" text blocks together. The ""door"" rule is at (7,2). So from (-4,3) for ""wall"", (-5,3) for ""is"", and (7,2) for ""door"", need to move them to form ""wall is door"".

This would require moving the ""door"" text block up to the ""is"" position. But the path might be blocked by walls.

This is getting very complex. Maybe the intended solution is to move the ""key is win"" rule and change it to ""baba is win"". The ""key is win"" rule is at (4,4), ""is"" at (5,4), ""win"" at (6,4). So forming ""baba is win"" would require moving ""baba"" from (-1,2), ""is"" from (5,4), and ""win"" from (6,4) together.

To do that, I need to navigate to these positions. Let's say I start moving left to (-1,2) to get the ""baba"" rule, then move right to (5,4) for ""is"", then right to (6,4) for ""win"". But the path from (-1,2) to (5,4) is possible if there are no walls in between. Looking at the map:

From (-1,2) to (0,0): possible.

From (0,0) to (5,4): need to move right and up, but there are walls at (1,4), (4,3), etc. So maybe blocked.

Alternative path: Move up from (-1,2) to (-1,3), then right to (0,3), but there's a wall at (1,3), so can't go right. Hmm.

This is really challenging. Maybe the correct action is to move right towards the key, hoping that eventually, by rearranging rules, the path becomes clear. But previous attempts failed, so perhaps a different approach is needed.

Another angle: The ball is at (2,3). If I can move the ball, maybe it can push a wall. But the ball isn't defined as pushable unless there's a rule allowing it. Since walls are stop, and the ball isn't a stop, maybe I can move it. But how does that help?

Alternatively, use the ball to create a new rule. For example, move the ball next to a rule to form a new text block. Not sure.

Wait, the active rules are key is win, wall is stop, baba is you. The goal is to make Baba win, which can be done by either picking up the key (if key is win) or changing the rule to make Baba win directly.

If I can create a new rule ""baba is win"", then just being Baba would make me win. To do that, I need to combine the ""baba"" rule, ""is"", and ""win"" rule into one sentence.

The ""baba"" rule is at (-1,2), ""is"" is at (5,4), and ""win"" is at (6,4). So the steps would be:

1. Move to (-1,2) to get the ""baba"" rule.
2. Move to (5,4) to get the ""is"" rule.
3. Move to (6,4) to get the ""win"" rule.
4. Rearrange them to form ""","

38,up,"<reasoning>
Let's try to figure this out. The active rules are ""key is win"", ""wall is stop"", and ""baba is you"". So, normally, I need to get the key because it's set as the win condition. But the key is 8 steps to the right and 1 step up. However, there are walls all around that area. The walls are defined as stop, so I can't push them. But since I'm Baba and ""baba is you"", I can move unless stopped by a wall.

Looking at the objects, the key is directly below the ""key is win"" rule. The door is at 7 steps right and 2 steps up, but I don't know if that's relevant. The ball is next to the key on the 3 steps right, 3 steps up wall. The rule `door` is located there, but since door isn't a stop, maybe I can move through it? Not sure. 

The problem is getting past the walls. The walls are 4 steps right and up to 4 steps up. To reach the key, I need to go right and down. But the wall at 4 steps right and 1 step up is blocking the direct path. Maybe I can move the ""key is win"" rule to change the win condition? If I can make Baba the win, then reaching Baba would be the goal. 

To do that, I need to move the `you` rule. The `you` rule is at 1 step to the right and 2 steps down. If I can move that next to ""baba"", then ""baba is you"" would become ""baba is you"" (which it already is), but maybe moving the `is` or `you` text blocks. Wait, the `you` rule is part of ""baba is you"". If I can separate them or rearrange, maybe I can make ""baba is win"" instead. 

But how do I move the text blocks? The key is down at 8 steps right and 1 step up. I need to get there, but the walls are in the way. Alternatively, maybe I can move the `win` rule from 9 steps right to somewhere else. For example, move the `win` text next to the key. So if I can push the `win` rule to be adjacent to the key, then ""key is win"" would still be active, but the key's position would be the win condition. Wait, the rule is ""key is win"", so the win condition is the key's location. But the key is at 8 steps right and 1 step up. So maybe I just need to reach that spot. 

But the wall at 4 steps right and 1 step up is blocking the path. Maybe I need to move that wall's rule. The `wall` rule is at 1 step left and 3 step up. If I can move that rule away, maybe I can remove the wall's stop property. But to move a rule, I need to be next to it and not be stopped. So first, I need to get to the `wall` rule at 1 step left and 3 step up. But how? The path is blocked by walls. 

Alternatively, maybe I can make the wall not a stop by changing its rule. For example, if I can make ""wall is stop"" into something else. But to do that, I need to move the `stop` rule. The `stop` rule is at 1 step right and 3 step up. If I can move that to a different position, maybe the wall isn't a stop anymore. 

This seems complicated. Let's recap. The goal is to get the key, which is at 8 right, 1 up. But there's a wall there. The walls are made stop by the ""wall is stop"" rule. If I can remove that rule or change it, the wall wouldn't block me. Alternatively, make myself able to move through walls by changing a rule. 

Wait, ""baba is you"" means I can move unless stopped by stop. So if I can change ""wall is stop"" to something else, like ""wall is push"" or remove it, then walls wouldn't stop me. But how to do that? 

The `wall is stop` rule is at 1 step left and 3 step up. If I can move that rule away, maybe the wall's property changes. But to move it, I need to be adjacent to it. My current position isn't clear from the observations, but maybe I'm next to some of these rules. 

Alternatively, if I can create a new rule that overrides ""wall is stop"". For example, ""baba is push"", but I don't have the `push` text block. Hmm. 

Another approach: The `key is win` rule is at 7 right, 4 up. If I can move that rule next to the key, but the key is already at 8 right, 1 up. Maybe not. 

Wait, the ball is at 5 right, 3 up. Maybe there's a way to use the ball to push walls? But the ball isn't a push property unless there's a rule saying so. 

This is tricky. Let me think step by step. 

1. Current active rules: key is win (so touching key wins), wall is stop (cannot pass walls), baba is you (I am movable unless stopped).
2. Key location: 8 right, 1 up. Blocked by a wall at 4 right, 1 up.
3. The wall at 4 right, 1 up is part of the ""wall is stop"" rule located at 1 left, 3 up. So the wall's stop property comes from that rule.
4. To remove the wall's stop property, I need to move or delete the ""wall is stop"" rule. But how?
5. To move a rule, I need to be adjacent to it and not blocked. Let's see where the ""wall is stop"" rule is: 1 step left and 3 step up from where? From the observation, the rule `wall` is at 4 left and 3 up, then `is` at 3 left and 3 up, then `stop` at 2 left and 3 up. Wait, the objects list has ""rule `stop` 1 step to the right and 3 step up"". Wait, the exact positions might matter. 

Wait, the objects are listed as:

- rule `wall` 4 step to the left and 3 step up
- rule `is` 3 step to the left and 3 step up
- rule `stop` 1 step to the right and 3 step up

So the ""wall is stop"" rule is formed by these three text blocks. The ""wall"" is at 4 left, 3 up; ""is"" at 3 left, 3 up; ""stop"" at 2 left, 3 up (since it's 1 step right from 3 left). Wait, no. The positions are relative to the player's position? Or relative to each other? This is unclear. 

Assuming that the rules are formed by adjacent text blocks. So ""wall is stop"" is made by the three blocks: wall, is, stop placed next to each other. To break this rule, I need to separate them. For example, move the ""stop"" block away from the ""is"" and ""wall"" blocks. 

If I can move the ""stop"" rule (the text block) to a different location, then the ""wall is stop"" rule would be broken. The ""stop"" block is at 1 step right and 3 step up. If I can move that block further away, then the rule would no longer be intact. 

So the plan is: move the ""stop"" text block away from the ""is"" and ""wall"" blocks. To do that, I need to be adjacent to the ""stop"" block. Let's see its position. The ""stop"" rule is 1 step right and 3 step up from the player's current position? Or from where? The observation doesn't specify the player's position, only the positions of the objects relative to the player. 

Assuming the player is at a certain point, but since the observations don't mention the player's position directly, it's hard to tell. Maybe the player is near the ""baba"" rule at 3 left and 2 steps down. The ""baba"" rule is at 3 step left and 2 steps down. If the player is adjacent to that, they could move the ""baba"" text blocks to change the ""baba is you"" rule. 

Alternatively, focus on moving the ""stop"" block. If I can move it to the right, for example, then the ""wall is stop"" rule would be broken. So the action would be to move right towards the ""stop"" block. 

Looking at the objects, the ""stop"" rule is 1 step right and 3 step up. So from the player's position, moving up 3 steps and right 1 step would reach the ""stop"" block. But there are walls in the way. The wall at 4 right and 1 up is blocking the path. 

Wait, perhaps the player is near the lower part. The ""baba"" rule is at 3 left and 2 steps down. Maybe the player is to the right of that. If I move left to reach the ""baba"" rule, then I can rearrange those to change ""baba is you"". For example, if I can make ""baba is win"", then touching Baba would win. But how? 

To make ""baba is win"", I need to have the text blocks ""baba"", ""is"", ""win"" adjacent. The existing ""baba is you"" rule is at 3 left and 2 steps down. The ""win"" rule is at 9 right and 4 up. That's far away. Maybe not feasible. 

Alternatively, move the ""you"" rule from 1 right and 2 steps down to be next to ""baba"". The ""you"" rule is at 1 right and 2 steps down. If I can move it left, then ""baba is you"" could become ""baba is [something else]"". But I need to be adjacent to the ""you"" block. 

This is getting too complicated. Maybe a simpler approach: since the key is the win condition, and it's behind walls, perhaps I need to push the walls. But I don't know if I can push them. The rules don't mention push. Unless ""baba is you"" allows pushing by default, but usually, in Baba Is You, you can push objects unless they have a ""stop"" rule. 

Wait, ""wall is stop"" means walls are stop, so you can't push them. But other objects like the key or ball might be pushable. The key is at 8 right, 1 up, behind a wall at 4 right, 1 up. If the wall is stop, I can't push it. So maybe I need to move the wall's rule. 

The ""wall is stop"" rule is made of three text blocks: wall, is, stop. If I can separate them, the rule is broken. The ""stop"" block is at 1 right and 3 up. If I move that block away, say to the right, then the ""wall is stop"" rule would be destroyed. 

So the action would be to move towards the ""stop"" block at 1 right, 3 up. To get there, the player might need to navigate through the map. But given the previous attempts where the action was ""left"" and failed, maybe the player is moving in the wrong direction. 

Alternatively, maybe the correct action is to move ""up"" to reach the ""stop"" block. But without knowing the exact layout, it's hard. 

Another possibility: the ""key is win"" rule is at 7 right, 4 up. If I can move that rule to the key's location (8 right, 1 up), then touching the key would satisfy the ""key is win"" rule. But how to move the rule? The player would need to be adjacent to the ""win"" block in the ""key is win"" rule and move it. 

The ""win"" block is at 9 right, 4 up. So moving left from there to the key's location. But again, walls are in the way. 

This is really challenging. Given the time I've spent and the previous failures, maybe the correct action now is to try moving in a different direction, perhaps ""up"" or ""down"" to reach the relevant rules. 

Alternatively, since the last action was ""left"" and it failed, maybe trying ""up"" to get closer to the ""stop"" rule. 

But I'm not sure. The best guess is to try to move towards the ""stop"" rule to break the ""wall is stop"" rule, allowing movement through the wall. So the action should be to move in the direction of the ""stop"" block, which is 1 step right and 3 steps up. But the player's current position isn't specified, so the exact action (up, down, left, right) can't be determined. 

Given the previous pattern where moving ""left"" was tried but failed, maybe the correct action now is to move ""up"" to reach higher ground where the rules are located. 

So, I'll go with ""up"" as the action.

Let's dive into this Baba Is You level. First, I need to understand the current state based on the observation. The active rules are ""key is win,"" ""wall is stop,"" and ""baba is you."" That's important because it tells me what's influencing the objects.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key located at 8 steps to the right. The rule ""key is win"" means that picking up the key will make it the win condition. But the key is in a position that might be blocked by walls. Let me visualize the layout.

To the right, there's a series of walls and a door at 7 steps to the right and 1 step up. The key is at 8 steps to the right, which is right next to the door. However, there's a wall at 4 steps to the right, so I need to navigate around it. The door might be open or closed, but since it's a rule, maybe I can interact with it somehow. Wait, the door is a rule as well: ""rule `door` 7 steps to the right and 2 step up."" Not sure if that's a static object or part of the rules.

The player (Baba) is currently at 1 step to the left and 2 steps down relative to the rule `baba` block. To move, I can check if I can push any text blocks to change the rules. The goal is to reach the key and then the win condition, which is now the key itself.

Since ""baba is you,"" I can move freely unless I hit a ""stop"" which is defined by ""wall is stop."" The walls are pretty spread out, but there's a wall at 4 steps right and 3 steps up. The key is at 8 steps right, so I need to get past the walls blocking the path.

Looking at the objects, the ball is at 5 steps right and 3 steps up. Not sure if that's relevant. The door rule is at 7 steps right and 2 steps up. Maybe manipulating that door rule could help, but I don't know how.

The key is at 8 steps right, but getting there might require moving the rule `win` which is at 9 steps right. If I can move the `win` rule to be under the key, then picking up the key would trigger the win. But how do I move the `win` rule? The `win` rule is part of the active rules, so I need to move the text blocks ""win,"" ""is,"" and ""key"" to form a new rule.

Wait, the current rule is ""key is win."" If I can break that rule and create a new one, maybe ""key is you"" or something else. But to do that, I need to move the text blocks. Let's see the positions:

- The `key` rule is at 7 steps right, 4 step up.
- `is` is at 8 steps right, 4 step up.
- `win` is at 9 steps right, 4 step up.

So these three form the ""key is win"" rule. If I can move these blocks to a different position, say next to Baba, I could create a new rule. For example, moving ""baba is you"" to make ""baba is win,"" which would make Baba the win condition. But I need to check if that's possible.

Baba's rule is at 4 step left and 2 steps down. The `is` and `you` blocks are there. If I can move the `you` block next to Baba, maybe I can create ""baba is win."" But how do I move the blocks? I can only move objects that aren't ""stop,"" which are walls. So I need to find a way to push the text blocks past the walls.

Looking at the current setup, there's a wall at 4 steps right and 3 steps up. But the text blocks for the key rule are at 7,8,9 steps right, 4 step up. Maybe I can move those by pushing them left or right, but there's a wall at 4 steps right, so perhaps not. Alternatively, if I can create a path by moving other blocks.

Wait, the door rule is at 7 steps right and 2 steps up. Maybe that's a movable block. If I can move the door rule out of the way, maybe I can access the key area. But the door is a rule, not a static object. Not sure if it's movable.

Alternatively, since the key is the win condition, maybe the goal is just to grab the key. But to get to the key at 8 steps right, I need to pass through the door at 7 steps right and 1 step up. But the door is a rule, so maybe I can manipulate it. If I can change the door's rule to not be a stop, then I can go through. But how?

Another angle: The ""wall is stop"" rule. If I can change that to ""wall is not stop,"" then walls wouldn't block me. To do that, I need to move the ""stop"" block from its current position. The ""stop"" rule is at 1 step right and 3 step up. If I can move that ""stop"" block away, then walls become passable. But to move it, I'd need to push it using other objects, but everything else seems to be walls or rules that are stop.

Wait, the ""baba is you"" rule means I can move, but I'm stuck because of the walls. Maybe I need to first remove the ""stop"" property from walls. Let's think: The ""wall is stop"" rule is at 3 step left and 3 step up (from previous observations). If I can move that ""wall is stop"" rule to a different position, like next to a wall, maybe making it ""wall is [something else]."" But how?

Alternatively, create a new rule that overrides ""wall is stop."" For example, ""wall is push"" or ""stop is nothing."" But to create that, I need to have the text blocks for ""wall,"" ""is,"" and the new property. Let me check the available text blocks on the map.

From the current observation, the text blocks present are:

- key, is, win (forming the key is win rule)
- wall, is, stop (forming wall is stop)
- door (as a rule)
- baba, is, you (forming baba is you)

So, the available text blocks are: key, is, win, wall, stop, door, baba, you.

If I can move these blocks to create a new rule that changes wall's property. For example, moving ""wall is stop"" to ""wall is you,"" but that would make walls controllable, which might not help. Or ""stop is key,"" which would remove the stop property from walls. But how to do that?

Alternatively, if I can create a rule that says ""stop is you,"" then the stop blocks (walls) would become you, meaning I can push them. But I need to have the ""stop is you"" rule. To do that, I need to move the existing ""stop"" block to be part of a new rule.

The current ""stop"" block is at 1 step right and 3 step up. If I can move it next to ""is"" and ""you,"" then create ""stop is you."" Let's see:

- The ""you"" block is at 1 step right and 2 steps down (from the rule `you` block).
- The ""is"" block is at 2 steps down.
- The ""stop"" block is at 1 step right and 3 step up.

To form ""stop is you,"" I need to arrange them as [stop] [is] [you]. The current positions are:

stop is at (x=1r, y=3u)
is at (x=2d, y=2d) – wait, no, looking back, the rule `is` at 2 steps down is probably a different position. Wait, in the current observation, the rule `is` is at 2 steps down relative to Baba? Let me check the exact positions.

In the latest observation, the objects are:

- rule `baba` 1 step to the left and 2 steps down
- rule `is` 2 steps down
- rule `you` 1 step to the right and 2 steps down

So, the `is` block is 2 steps down from Baba, and `you` is 1 step right and 2 steps down. The `stop` block is at 1 step right and 3 step up.

To create ""stop is you,"" I need to move the `stop` block to be adjacent to `is` and `you`. But the `stop` block is currently at 1r, 3u, which is upper right relative to Baba. The `is` and `you` are lower down. It might be challenging to move the `stop` block down there, especially if walls are in the way.

Alternatively, create a new rule that makes Baba the win. The current rule is ""key is win,"" but if I can make ""baba is win,"" then reaching Baba (which I am) would trigger the win. To do that, I need to move the `win` block from its current position (9r, 3u) to be next to Baba and `is`.

Baba's rule is at 1 step left and 2 steps down. The `is` block is 2 steps down, and `you` is 1 step right and 2 steps down. So, if I can move the `win` block to be adjacent to `baba` and `is`, forming ""baba is win,"" then that would work.

The `win` block is currently at 9 steps right and 3 steps up. To get it to Baba's location (1 step left, 2 steps down), I need to move it left and down. But there's a wall at 4 steps right, which might block the path. Unless I can remove the ""wall is stop"" rule first.

This seems complex. Maybe a simpler approach: since the key is the win condition, just get to the key. But how?

The key is at 8 steps right. To get there, I need to move right past the door at 7r, 1u. The door is a rule, so maybe it's a door that can be opened by the key. If I have the key, then the door can be opened. But to get the key, I need to reach it first.

Alternatively, maybe pushing the key. But the key is an object; can I push it? In Baba Is You, you can push objects if they're not defined as stop. Currently, walls are stop, but other objects might be pushable. If the key is not stop, I can push it. But the key's property is ""win,"" which doesn't make it stop. So maybe I can push the key towards me.

Wait, but the key is at 8r, and I'm at 4r. The distance is quite far. Maybe there's a way to manipulate the rules to allow movement through walls.

Another idea: Change the ""wall is stop"" rule to ""wall is push,"" so I can push walls out of the way. To do that, I need to move the ""stop"" block from ""wall is stop"" to create ""wall is push."" Let's see:

Current ""wall is stop"" rule is formed by:
- wall at 1 step left, 3 step up
- is at 3 step up
- stop at 1 step right, 3 step up

If I can move the ""stop"" block to replace ""push"" with ""stop,"" but I don't have a ""push"" block. Wait, the available text blocks are key, is, win, wall, stop, door, baba, you. There's no ""push"" block, so I can't create that rule directly.

Alternatively, create ""wall is key,"" which would make walls act like keys. Not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, make ""stop is key,"" which would remove the stop property from walls by replacing it with key. But how?

This is getting a bit tangled. Let's recap:

- Goal: Make the key the win by either grabbing it or changing the rules.
- To grab the key, need to get past the walls and door.
- To change rules, need to rearrange text blocks.

Perhaps the quickest way is to try to move the key towards me. If the key is not stop, I can push it. But how do I move the key? I would need to be adjacent to it and push it. However, the key is at 8r, and I'm at 1 step left and 2 steps down. The distance is quite large, and there are walls in between.

Alternatively, create a new rule that makes ""baba is win,"" so touching Baba (myself) wins. To do that, I need to move the ""win"" block to be next to ""baba"" and ""is.""

The ""win"" block is at 9r, 3u. I need to move it left and down to be near Baba's rule (1 step left, 2 steps down). But moving it there would require pushing past other objects. The path is blocked by walls at 4r, so unless I can remove the walls or make them passable.

Wait, if I can change ""wall is stop"" to something else, like ""wall is you,"" then walls become movable. Let's try that.

The current ""wall is stop"" rule is at:
- wall: 1 step left, 3 step up
- is: 3 step up (position not clear, but assuming adjacent)
- stop: 1 step right, 3 step up

To change this to ""wall is you,"" I need to replace ""stop"" with ""you."" So move the ""stop"" block to where ""you"" is. The ""you"" block is at 1 step right and 2 steps down. That's quite far from the current ""stop"" position at 1r, 3u. Moving the ""stop"" block down there would require overcoming the distance and possible obstacles.

It's a long move, but maybe possible. Alternatively, create a new rule ""wall is you"" by placing the blocks next to each other. For that, I need a ""wall"" block, an ""is"" block, and a ""you"" block. The ""wall"" block is already part of the existing ""wall is stop"" rule. The ""is"" block is near there, and the ""you"" block is at 1r, 2d.

So, if I can move the ""wall"" and ""is"" blocks from the ""wall is stop"" rule to be next to the ""you"" block, forming ""wall is you."" Let's see:

The current ""wall is stop"" rule components are:
- wall at 1l, 3u
- is at 3u (assuming adjacent)
- stop at 1r, 3u

To create ""wall is you,"" I need to rearrange these blocks so that after ""wall"" and ""is,"" we have ""you."" So, move the ""stop"" block out of the way and replace it with ""you.""

But the ""you"" block is at 1r, 2d, which is below the current ""stop"" position. Moving the ""stop"" block down there would require pushing it past other objects. There's a wall at 4r, which might block the path. Unless I can move the wall, but walls are stop.

This seems difficult. Maybe another approach: instead of changing the wall's property, create a new rule that allows movement. For example, ""push is you,"" which would let me push objects. But I don't have a ""push"" block.

Alternatively, ""rule is win,"" but that doesn't make sense.

Hmm. Let's think differently. The key is at 8r, and the rule ""key is win"" is active. If I can reach the key and pick it up, then the level is won. To do that, I need to navigate past the walls and door. The door is at 7r, 2u, and the key is at 8r. The door's rule is ""rule `door` 7 steps to the right and 2 step up."" Not sure if that affects anything.

If the door is a normal door, usually in Baba Is You you need a key to open it. Since the key is the win condition, maybe having the key allows opening the door. But how do I interact with the door? If I'm next to the door and have the key, maybe I can push the door or something. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the door is just a visual element, and the real obstacle is the walls. The walls at 4r and 3u, 2u, etc., are blocking the path to the key. If I can remove the ""wall is stop"" rule, then I can move through walls. So, changing ""wall is stop"" to ""wall is push"" or another property.

To do that, I need to rearrange the text blocks of the ""wall is stop"" rule. The current blocks are:

- wall at 1l, 3u
- is at 3u (adjacent)
- stop at 1r, 3u

To change it to ""wall is [something else]"", say ""wall is key,"" I need to replace ""stop"" with ""key."" But where is the ""key"" block? The ""key"" block is part of the ""key is win"" rule at 7r,4u. To get it to the ""wall is stop"" rule's position, I would need to move it left, which is possible if there's a path.

But moving the ""key"" block from 7r,4u to 1r,3u is a long distance. There are walls in between, like at 4r. Unless I can push the walls aside by changing their property first.

This is quite complex. Maybe the intended solution is to move the ""win"" rule to the key's location. The current ""key is win"" rule is at 7r,4u (key), 8r,4u (is), 9r,4u (win). If I can move the ""win"" block to be next to the key, forming ""key is win"" which it already is, that doesn't help. Wait, no—the key is already the win. So maybe picking up the key is sufficient. But how to reach it.

Alternatively, create a new rule that says ""baba is win,"" so touching Baba (myself) wins. To do that, I need to move the ""win"" block to be next to ""baba"" and ""is.""

The ""win"" block is at 9r,3u. ""Baba"" is at 1l,2d. The ""is"" block is at 2d. So, need to move the ""win"" block to 1l,2d and arrange ""baba is win.""

This would","

Let me try to figure out what I need to do here. The active rules are key is win, wall is stop, and baba is you. So, the goal is probably to get the key, which is acting as the win condition. But normally, the key would be something you pick up, but since key is win, maybe just reaching the key makes you win? Or maybe there's a door involved.

Looking at the objects, there's a key located at 8 steps to the right. But there's a wall at 4 steps to the right, which is a stop. So I can't go straight right past the wall. Wait, but the player is presumably Baba, since ""baba is you"". So I need to navigate around the walls to reach the key.

Looking at the map layout:

- The key is at 8 steps right, same horizontal level as the current position (since the wall is at 4 steps right and 1 step up, but the key is at 8 steps right and 1 step up? Wait, the observation shows the key is at 8 steps to the right, no step up or down. Same with the door at 7 steps right and 1 step up.

Wait, the player's position isn't explicitly stated, but the objects are relative. Let's assume the player is at the position of ""rule `baba` 1 step to the left and 3 steps down"". So the baba rule is at 1 left, 3 down from somewhere. Maybe the player is at that position?

But maybe it's better to visualize the grid. Let's try to sketch it out based on the objects:

Current active rules: key is win, wall is stop, baba is you.

Objects:

1. wall at 4 right, 3 up
2. rule `key` at 7 right, 3 up
3. rule `is` at 8 right, 3 up
4. rule `win` at 9 right, 3 up
5. rule `wall` at 1 left, 2 up
6. rule `is` at 2 up
7. rule `stop` at 1 right, 2 up
8. wall at 4 right, 2 up
9. ball at 5 right, 2 up
10. wall at 4 right, 1 up
11. rule `door` at 7 right, 1 up
12. wall at 4 right
13. key at 8 right
14. wall at 4 right, 1 down
15. wall at 4 right, 2 down
16. rule `baba` at 1 left, 3 down
17. rule `is` at 3 down
18. rule `you` at 1 right, 3 down
19. wall at 4 right, 3 down

Assuming the player is at the position of rule `baba`, which is 1 left and 3 down from where? Maybe the player's position is inferred from the rules. Alternatively, the player is at the same position as the ""baba"" text block. Wait, in Baba Is You, the player is usually the Baba character, and the text ""BABA IS YOU"" makes that character controllable. So the player's position is where the ""BABA"" text block is located. Looking at the objects, there's a rule `baba` at 1 step to the left and 2 steps down from the current position? Wait, the observation says ""rule `baba` 4 step to the left and 2 steps down"" — no, wait, in the last observation, the rule `baba` is at 1 step to the left and 3 steps down. Let me check the latest observation:

In the current observation, the objects include:

rule `baba` 1 step to the left and 3 steps down

So the player (Baba) is at that position. So the player's position is 1 left, 3 down from wherever the reference point is. But maybe the reference point is the top-left corner, but it's hard to tell. Alternatively, all positions are relative to the player's starting position. This is getting a bit confusing, but let's try to map it out.

Assuming the player is at position (0,0), then:

- The rule `baba` is at (-1, -3)
- The wall at 4 steps right would be at (4,0)
- The wall at 4 right, 3 up is at (4,3)
- The key is at (8,0)
- The door is at (7,1)
- The rule `win` is at (9,3)

But the active rules say key is win, so reaching the key would make us win. However, the path to the key is blocked by walls. Let's see:

From the player's position (-1,-3), moving right towards the key at (8,0). The path to the right is blocked by walls at (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), etc. So to get to the key at (8,0), we need to go around the walls. But how?

Looking at the objects:

- There's a rule `door` at (7,1). Maybe we need to interact with the door? But the rules are key is win, so perhaps picking up the key makes us win. Alternatively, the door could be a way out if we have the key, but the current rules don't specify door's property.

Another approach: Since ""key is win"", maybe we just need to touch the key. But the key is at (8,0), and the player is at (-1,-3). The direct path is blocked by walls. So perhaps we need to move right past the walls. But the wall at (4,0) is a stop, meaning we can't move through it. Unless we can push it or remove the rule.

Wait, in Baba Is You, you can move text blocks that are not STOP. So if a rule says ""wall is stop"", then any wall is immovable. But the player is Baba, who is ""you"", so we can move unless blocked by STOP.

So to get from (-1,-3) to (8,0), we need to navigate around the walls. Let's see:

Current position: (-1,-3)

Looking at the walls:

- At (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3) are walls. So moving right past x=4 is blocked.

But there's a rule `door` at (7,1). Maybe we need to get to the door? But how?

Alternatively, perhaps we can manipulate the rules. For example, if we can change ""wall is stop"" to something else, like ""wall is you"", then walls become movable. But to do that, we need to move the text blocks ""wall"", ""is"", and ""stop"" to form a new rule.

Looking at the current rules:

- ""key is win"" is at (7,3)
- ""is"" at (8,3)
- ""win"" at (9,3)

- ""wall is stop"" is formed by the rule `wall` at (1,-1) (since rule `wall` is 1 step left and 2 step up from where? Wait, in the current observation, the rule `wall` is 1 step to the left and 2 steps up. So if the player is at (-1,-3), then rule `wall` is at (-2,-1). Then ""is"" is at (-1,-1), and ""stop"" is at (0,-1). So the rule ""wall is stop"" is at positions (-2,-1) → (-1,-1) → (0,-1).

To change this rule, we need to move these text blocks. For example, change ""stop"" to ""you"", making ""wall is you"", which would make walls movable. But to do that, we need to push the ""stop"" text block.

But ""stop"" is a property, and the text blocks that are STOP cannot be moved. Wait, the rules say ""wall is stop"", meaning walls have the STOP property. So any text block that is STOP cannot be moved. But in the current observation, the rule `stop` is at (0,-1), which is part of the ""wall is stop"" rule. Since ""stop"" is a STOP property, can we move it?

No, because if a text block is defined as STOP, you can't move it. So in this case, the ""stop"" text block is part of the ""wall is stop"" rule and is therefore STOP, making it immovable. That complicates things.

Alternative approach: Since ""key is win"", maybe we can pick up the key by moving next to it. But how to reach it.

Looking at the key's position: (8,0). The path from the player's position (-1,-3) to (8,0) is blocked by walls at x=4. So we need to find a way around.

Looking at other objects: There's a ball at (5,2). Not sure if that's relevant.

Alternatively, maybe we can create a new rule that allows us to pass through walls. For example, change ""wall is stop"" to ""wall is die"" or something else. But to do that, we need to move the relevant text blocks.

The original ""wall is stop"" rule is composed of the text blocks ""wall"" at (-2,-1), ""is"" at (-1,-1), and ""stop"" at (0,-1). If we can move these blocks to form a new rule, like ""wall is you"", then walls would become controllable. But since ""stop"" is a STOP property, we can't move it. So this might be impossible.

Another idea: Maybe the door at (7,1) is a way out. If we can reach the door, perhaps it opens when we have the key. But the current rule for door isn't specified. Maybe ""door is open"" or something, but there's no such rule here.

Alternatively, since the key is the win condition, maybe we just need to move to the key's position. Let's see if there's a path.

From the player's position (-1,-3):

Possible moves:

1. Move right towards (0,-3). But is there a wall there? Checking the objects:

Looking for walls at (0,-3). Not listed, so probably free.

2. Move up to (-1,-2). Is there a wall? The walls listed are at (4,0), (4,1), etc., which are far to the right.

So maybe the player can move generally towards the right and up.

But the main obstacle is the wall starting at (4,0) and extending upwards.

Wait, the wall at (4,0) is a stop, so can't pass through. To go around it, maybe go above or below.

Looking at the wall positions:

At (4,0): wall

(4,1): wall

(4,2): wall

(4,3): wall

So a vertical wall from y=0 to y=3 at x=4.

To go around it, perhaps move left to x=3, but x=3 at various y levels:

At x=3, y=3: wall

y=2: ball

y=1: wall

y=0: wall

So moving left to x=3 is also blocked by walls below and above, except at y=2 there's a ball.

Alternatively, go above the wall at x=4. For example, move from (4,3) up to (4,4), but there's no information about objects beyond that.

Alternatively, go to the right of the wall. The key is at x=8, so after x=4, there's a gap? The next walls are at x=4, but beyond that, what's at x=5,6,7,8?

From the objects listed:

- At x=5, y=2: ball

- x=7, y=1: door

- x=8, y=0: key

So from x=4 onwards, there are objects at x=5 (ball), x=7 (door), x=8 (key). But the path from x=4 to x=8 is clear except for the walls at x=4 itself.

Wait, but to get from x=4 to x=5, you have to move right from x=4, but the wall at x=4, y=0 is a stop. So you can't move into x=4, y=0. But maybe you can move around it by going up or down.

For example, from the player's position (-1,-3), move right to (0,-3), then (1,-3), etc., until reaching x=3. At x=3, y=2 there's a ball. Maybe push the ball? But ball isn't a stop, so maybe it can be moved. But how does that help?

Alternatively, move to x=3, y=2 (ball), then move right to x=4, but the wall at x=4, y=2 is present. So can't go there. Hmm.

Another approach: Since the key is at (8,0), and it's a win condition, maybe we can create a new rule that allows us to win by touching the ball instead. For example, change ""key is win"" to ""ball is win"". To do that, we need to move the text blocks ""key"", ""is"", and ""win"" to form ""ball is win"".

The current ""key is win"" rule is at x=7,8,9 y=3. So the text blocks are at:

- key: (7,3)

- is: (8,3)

- win: (9,3)

To change this to ""ball is win"", we need to replace ""key"" with ""ball"". So move the ""key"" block to where ""ball"" is, but ""key"" is at (7,3), and ""ball"" is at (5,2). That would require moving the ""key"" block down to (5,2), which might be possible if the path is clear.

But moving the ""key"" block would require pushing it if there's no STOP property blocking. Since ""key"" is part of the ""key is win"" rule, but the rule itself doesn't impose any movement restrictions. So maybe we can move the ""key"" block to (5,2), then place ""is"" and ""win"" next to it to form ""ball is win"".

This would make the ball the win condition, allowing us to win by touching it. The ball is at (5,2), which might be reachable.

So step by step:

1. Move to the position of the ""key"" text block at (7,3).

2. Move left or right to position the ""key"" block next to ""ball"" at (5,2).

But the path from (7,3) to (5,2) might be blocked by other objects. Let's see:

From (7,3), moving left to (6,3), then (5,3), but y=3 at x=5 is the ""win"" text block. So (5,3) is occupied by ""win"". Can't move there.

Alternatively, move down from (7,3) to (7,2). Is there a wall there? At x=7, y=2 there's a ""door"" rule. So the door is at (7,1), but at (7,2) it's empty? Not sure. The objects listed are:

- rule `door` at 7 steps right and 2 step up, which would be (7,2) if the player is at (0,0). So at (7,2) there's a door rule, but no wall. So moving down from (7,3) to (7,2) is possible.

Then from (7,2), move left to (6,2), (5,2). At (5,2) is the ball. Can we move the ""key"" block there?

The ""key"" block is a text block, and since it's part of the ""key is win"" rule, but unless there's a STOP property preventing it, we can move it. The only STOP property is from the ""wall is stop"" rule, which affects walls, not text blocks. So yes, we can move the ""key"" block.

So moving the ""key"" from (7,3) to (5,2) by moving down to (7,2), then left to (6,2), (5,2). Once there, we can place ""is"" and ""win"" next to it to form ""ball is win"".

Then, touching the ball at (5,2) would make us win.

But how to do this step by step in the game:

1. Move down from the player's position to reach the ""key"" rule.

Wait, the player is at rule `baba` which is 1 left and 3 down from somewhere. If we assume the player's position is at (0,0), then the ""baba"" rule is at (-1, -3). To reach the ""key"" at (7,3), the player needs to move right and up.

But the path might be blocked. Let's outline the possible moves:

Player starts at (-1, -3).

Needs to get to (7,3) to access the ""key"" text block.

Possible route:

Right to (0,-3), (1,-3), ..., (4,-3). But at x=4, y=-3, is there a wall? Not listed, so probably free.

Then up to (4,0), but at x=4, y=0 there's a wall. So can't go there. Need to go around the wall at x=4.

Since the wall is vertical from y=0 to y=3 at x=4, we need to go around it either above or below.

Going above: From (4,0), move up to (4,1), but that's a wall. Can't.

Going below: From (4,0), move down to (4,-1), but there's no info about that area. Maybe possible.

Alternatively, from x=3, move up to avoid the wall.

This is getting complicated. Maybe a better approach is to focus on moving the necessary text blocks to change the win condition.

Alternatively, since the key is at (8,0) and it's a win, maybe we can push the key block to the player's position. But the key is a text block, so if it's not STOP, we can move it. The key's property is determined by the ""key is win"" rule, but the key block itself isn't STOP. So yes, we can move it.

So to get the key, we need to move it to our position. But the key is at (8,0), and we're at (-1,-3). The distance is huge, and there are walls in between","

The active rules are key is win, wall is stop, and baba is you. So right now, if I touch the key, it acts as a win condition, and walls are stoppable. I'm Baba, so moving around, but need to avoid walls.

Looking at the objects on the map. There's a ball at 5 steps right and 2 steps up. The key is at 8 steps right, 1 step up. The door is at 7 steps right and 1 step up. Oh, but the key is win, so grabbing it would mean I win? Wait, the rule is key is win, which I think means that if I take the key, then I become win? Or does it mean that the key itself is considered the win object? Hmm, in Baba Is You, usually, if something is the win object, touching it makes you win. So since key is win, touching the key should win the level.

But the key is at 8 steps right, 1 step up. So from my current position, which I'm assuming is at the same location as the Baba text block. Let me check where Baba is located. The rule `baba` is at 1 step left and 3 steps down from the current position. Wait, the current observation's Baba rule is at 1 step to the left and 3 steps down. So my position is 1 step right and 3 steps up from there. Let me map this out.

Current position: Let's assume the Baba text block is at coordinates (x, y). Then, according to the rule `baba` is at 1 step left and 3 steps down, so Baba's position would be (x - 1, y - 3). But maybe the coordinate system is relative. Alternatively, perhaps the observation lists objects relative to the player's position. This can get a bit confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the player is at the same position as the Baba text block. So the Baba text block is located at 4 steps left and 2 steps down from somewhere? Wait, no. Let's look at the objects again. The rule `baba` is at 1 step to the left and 3 steps down. So if the player is at (0,0), then the rule `baba` is at (-1, -3). But the player is Baba, so the player's position is where the Baba text block is not, because the rules are separate. Wait, no. In Baba Is You, the player is the object that is defined as ""YOU"". So the player is wherever the ""BABA IS YOU"" rule is applied. In this case, the active rule is ""baba is you"", so the player is the Baba object. But where is the Baba object located on the map?

Looking at the objects listed, there's a rule `baba` at 1 step to the left and 2 steps down, but that's a text block, not the actual Baba object. The actual Baba object is the one that's being controlled. Wait, maybe the player's position is the same as the ""BABA"" text block that's part of the ""baba is you"" rule. Let me check. The rule `baba` is at 4 step to the left and 2 steps down. Wait, no, in the latest observation, the rule `baba` is at 1 step to the left and 3 steps down. So if the player is Baba, their position is where the ""BABA"" text block is that's part of the ""baba is you"" rule. But in this case, the ""baba is you"" rule is made up of three text blocks: rule `baba` at 1 step left and 2 steps down, rule `is` at 3 step left and 2 steps down, and rule `you` at 2 step left and 2 steps down. So the ""baba is you"" rule is positioned somewhere on the map, but the actual Baba that I control is probably at the same location as the ""BABA"" text block in that rule. Wait, no. In Baba Is You, the player is the object that is designated as ""YOU"". So if ""BABA IS YOU"", then the player is the Baba object. But where is that Baba object located on the grid? It might be a separate object from the text blocks. Hmm, this is a bit unclear from the observations provided. The observation lists objects like walls, keys, doors, and balls, but where is the actual player (Baba)?

Assuming that the player's position is the same as the ""BABA"" text block that's part of the ""baba is you"" rule. So the ""baba"" rule is at 1 step to the left and 3 steps down from the player's current position. Therefore, the player is 1 step to the right and 3 steps up from the ""baba"" text block. So if the ""baba"" rule is at, say, coordinates (x, y), then the player is at (x + 1, y + 3). But without knowing the absolute coordinates, it's challenging. Maybe I should focus on relative movements.

The key is at 8 steps to the right and 1 step up from the player's current position. The door is at 7 steps to the right and 1 step up. So the key and door are in the same vertical line, one step apart horizontally. The wall is at 4 steps to the right, so between the player and the key/door there's a wall at 4 steps right. So the path to the key is blocked by a wall. But the rule ""wall is stop"" means that walls are stoppable, so I can't move through them. Therefore, I need to find a way to move past the wall.

But how? The key is win, so if I can reach it, I win. Alternatively, maybe I can change the rules to make the wall passable. For example, if I can change ""wall is stop"" to something else, like ""wall is you"" or ""stop is push"", then I could move through walls. But to do that, I need to move the text blocks that make up the rules.

Looking at the rules on the map: the active rules are ""key is win"", ""wall is stop"", and ""baba is you"". These are each composed of three text blocks: for example, ""key is win"" is made up of the rule `key` at 4 steps right and 4 step up, rule `is` at 5 steps right and 4 step up, and rule `win` at 6 steps right and 4 step up. So each rule is three text blocks placed horizontally.

To modify a rule, I need to move these text blocks to create a new rule. For instance, if I can take the ""wall"" text block and rearrange it with different properties. The ""wall is stop"" rule is at 4 step left and 3 step up: rule `wall` at 4 step left and 3 step up, rule `is` at 3 step left and 3 step up, rule `stop` at 2 step left and 3 step up. So the ""wall is stop"" rule is located to the left of the player's current position.

If I can move the ""stop"" text block from the ""wall is stop"" rule and attach it to something else, maybe making ""wall is you"" or ""stop is key"". But to move a text block, it has to not be part of a STOP or similar immovable property. The ""wall is stop"" rule's ""stop"" is part of that rule, but since the rule itself is active, can I move the ""stop"" text block? Wait, the tips say that you can only move objects or text that are not defined as ""STOP"" or similar immovable properties. So if a text block is part of a rule, can it be moved? For example, in the ""wall is stop"" rule, the ""stop"" text block is part of that rule. But since the rule is active, maybe the text blocks can still be moved unless they are individually STOPped.

But the rule ""wall is stop"" makes ""wall"" have the property ""stop"", which means that any wall is stoppable. However, the individual text blocks that make up the rule might still be movable unless they are part of another rule that makes them stop. In this case, the ""stop"" text block is part of the ""wall is stop"" rule, but unless there's another rule like ""stop is stop"", which there isn't, the ""stop"" text block can be moved.

So the plan could be: move the ""stop"" text block from the ""wall is stop"" rule and attach it to the ""wall"" text block to create a new rule, like ""wall is you"", making walls passable. Then I could go through the wall to reach the key.

Alternatively, create a rule that makes ""door"" something else, but the door is already a rule at 7 steps right and 2 step up. Wait, the rule `door` is there, but I'm not sure how that interacts. The key is win, so touching the key wins. The door might be a locked door that requires the key, but in this level, since key is win, maybe the door is irrelevant.

But let's focus on modifying the ""wall is stop"" rule. To do that, I need to move the ""stop"" text block. The ""stop"" text block is at 2 steps left and 3 step up. So if I can move that ""stop"" text block to another part of the map, perhaps to create a new rule like ""wall is you"".

To create ""wall is you"", I need the text blocks ""wall"", ""is"", and ""you"". The ""wall"" text block is part of the original ""wall is stop"" rule at 4 steps left and 3 step up. The ""is"" text block is at 3 steps left and 3 step up. The ""you"" text block is part of the ""baba is you"" rule at 2 steps left and 2 steps down.

Wait, the ""baba is you"" rule is at 4 step to the left and 2 steps down, with ""baba"", ""is"", and ""you"" text blocks. So the ""you"" text block is at 2 steps left and 2 steps down. If I can take the ""you"" text block and combine it with the ""wall"" and ""is"" text blocks to make ""wall is you"".

But to do that, I need to move the ""you"" text block from its current position to the area near the ""wall is stop"" rule. The ""stop"" text block is at 2 steps left and 3 step up. So perhaps I can move the ""you"" text block to replace the ""stop"" text block, creating ""wall is you"".

Let me visualize the positions. The original ""wall is stop"" rule is at:

- rule `wall` at 4 steps left and 3 step up

- rule `is` at 3 steps left and 3 step up

- rule `stop` at 2 steps left and 3 step up

If I move the ""stop"" text block (at 2 left, 3 up) to, say, the position where the ""you"" text block is (2 left, 2 down), but that's two steps down. Alternatively, find a way to reposition these text blocks.

Alternatively, move the ""you"" text block from 2 left, 2 down to 2 left, 3 up (where the ""stop"" is), then the rule would become ""wall is you"", making walls passable.

But how to move the ""you"" text block. To move it, I need to be adjacent to it and move it in a direction, but I have to consider if it's blocked by STOP rules. The ""you"" text block is not part of a STOP rule, so it can be moved.

Assuming the player's position is somewhere near the ""baba is you"" rule. Let's say the player is at the location of the ""BABA"" object, which might be at 1 step right and 3 steps up from the ""baba"" text block (which is at 1 left, 3 down from the player). So player's position is (1R, 3U) relative to the ""baba"" text block. But this is getting too vague without a map layout.

Alternatively, perhaps the player is at the position of the ""BABA"" text block that's part of the ""baba is you"" rule. In the latest observation, the ""baba"" rule is at 1 step left and 3 steps down. So if the player is at that position, but that's the text block, not the actual Baba object. This is confusing.

Maybe a better approach is to look for the key and find a path to it by manipulating rules. The key is at 8 steps right and 1 step up, but there's a wall at 4 steps right. So between me and the key, there's a wall. If I can change the wall's property from stop to something else, like push or you, then I can move through it.

To change ""wall is stop"" to ""wall is push"", I need to modify the rule. The current ""wall is stop"" rule is composed of three text blocks: wall, is, stop. If I can replace the ""stop"" with ""push"", then the rule becomes ""wall is push"". But to do that, I need to move the ""stop"" text block and replace it with ""push"".

However, there's no ""push"" text block on the map. The available text blocks are key, is, win, wall, door, baba, you, stop. So I can't create a ""push"" rule unless I have the text block. Since there's no ""push"" text block present, I can't directly create that rule.

Alternatively, maybe create a rule that makes ""stop"" a different property. For example, ""stop is key"", which would mean that stop objects are equivalent to keys. But I'm not sure if that helps. Or ""stop is you"", making stop objects passable. But again, to do that, I need to rearrange the existing text blocks.

Looking at the available text blocks, after the ""key is win"" rule, there's a ""wall is stop"" rule, and then the ""baba is you"" rule. There's also a ""door"" rule. So the text blocks available are key, is, win, wall, stop, you, door, and possibly others.

To create ""wall is you"", I need the ""wall"", ""is"", and ""you"" text blocks. The ""you"" is part of the ""baba is you"" rule. So if I can move the ""you"" text block from its current position (2 steps left and 2 steps down) to the position of the ""stop"" text block (2 steps left and 3 steps up), then the ""wall is stop"" rule would become ""wall is you"", making walls passable.

So the steps would be:

1. Move the ""you"" text block (from 2L, 2D) to 2L, 3U (where the ""stop"" is).

But how to move the ""you"" text block. The player needs to be adjacent to it and move it in the desired direction. Assuming the player is near the ""baba is you"" rule, which is at 1L, 3D. So the ""you"" text block is at 2L, 2D relative to the player's position. If the player is at, say, position (0,0), then the ""you"" text block is at (-2, -2). To move it to (-2, -1) to replace the ""stop"" text block at (-2, -3) would require moving up.

But this is all very hypothetical. The key challenge is determining the player's current position relative to the objects. However, given the observations, the most promising action seems to be moving towards the ""you"" text block to swap it with the ""stop"" text block, thereby changing the wall's property.

Alternatively, since the key is win, maybe the quickest way is to push the key past the wall. But to push the key, the rule would need to allow it. However, the key's rule is ""key is win"", which doesn't necessarily make it pushable. Unless there's a rule that makes objects pushable, like ""push is win"" or something. But there's no such rule here.

Another angle: maybe the door at 7 steps right and 1 step up is unlocked, and the key is inside. But since the key is win, touching it should suffice. The door might be a red herring.

Putting it all together, the optimal action is to move the ""you"" text block to replace the ""stop"" text block, changing the rule to ""wall is you"" so that walls can be passed. To do that, the player needs to navigate to the ""you"" text block, pick it up, and move it to the position of the ""stop"" text block.

Assuming the player is positioned such that they can move left to reach the ""you"" text block. In the latest observation, after several left actions, the player's position might have moved left multiple times. Looking at the previous actions: the user tried right, left, left, up, etc. Each action changes the player's position.

But without knowing the exact player position, it's hard to say. However, based on the last few actions, the player might have moved left multiple times, possibly reaching the area near the ""baba is you"" rule.

Alternatively, if the player is near the ""you"" text block, moving it up would replace the ""stop"" text block. So the action would be to move the ""you"" text block up, which would require the player to be adjacent to it and then move it in the desired direction.

But the allowed actions are idle, up, down, left, right. So the player can't directly move text blocks; they have to move themselves and then push the text blocks if possible. To move a text block, the player must be adjacent to it and then move in the direction they want to push it, provided that the destination is not blocked by a STOP object.

So, for example, to move the ""you"" text block from its current position to where the ""stop"" is, the player would need to be adjacent to the ""you"" text block, move towards it, and then push it north (up) into the ""stop"" text block's spot.

However, the path to the ""you"" text block might be blocked. The ""you"" text block is at 2 steps left and 2 steps down from the player's current position. If the player is at, say, position (0,0), the ""you"" is at (-2, -2). To get there, the player would need to move left twice and down twice. But along the way, are there any STOP objects? The walls are at 4 steps right, which is in the opposite direction. So maybe the path is clear.","

Let's see. The active rules are ""key is win"", ""wall is stop"", and ""baba is you"". So, normally, the key is considered the winning object because of ""key is win"". But I remember that in Baba Is You, you can change the rules by moving text blocks. Since the player is Baba (because ""baba is you""), I need to figure out how to manipulate the rules to reach the key or change the win condition.

Looking at the objects, the key is 8 steps to the right. But there's a ""rule door"" at 7 steps right and 1 step up, and walls blocking the path. Also, there's a ball at 5 steps right and 3 steps up, but I'm not sure how that helps yet. The ""win"" rule is at 9 steps right, same as the key's column but further right. 

Wait, the current active rule says ""key is win"", so touching the key would win the level. But the key is 8 steps to the right, and I'm probably at the starting position, maybe near the ""baba"" rule at 4 steps right and 3 steps down. Let me check the map structure.

The player (Baba) is likely at the position of the ""baba"" rule, which is 1 step left and 3 steps down from the wall at 4 steps right and 3 steps down. So moving right from there would take me towards the key. But there's a wall at 4 steps right and 1 step up, and other walls blocking the path. The door rule is at 7 steps right and 1 step up, but I don't see a door object mentioned. Maybe the door is a rule that can be manipulated.

Alternatively, since ""key is win"" is active, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule to point to something else, like Baba, so that reaching Baba itself wins. To do that, I need to move the ""win"" text block (which is at 9 steps right and 3 steps up) and attach it to Baba. But how?

Baba's rules are at 1 step left and 2 steps down from the wall at 4 steps right and 2 steps down. So the ""baba is you"" rule is there. To make ""baba is win"", I'd have to move the ""win"" rule next to ""baba"" and ""is"". The ""is"" rule is at 3 steps down, 2 steps right. So maybe moving ""win"" to be after ""baba is"" would create ""baba is win"", making Baba the win condition. 

But first, I need to move the ""win"" text block. The ""win"" rule is currently at 9 steps right and 3 steps up. To get there, I have to navigate past walls. The key is at 8 steps right, which might be closer. If I can reach the key first, maybe I can use it to override a rule? Not sure. Alternatively, pathfinding to the ""win"" text block to move it.

However, the player is controlled as Baba, and walls are stop. So moving right from the initial position (assuming starting near the bottom) towards the key. But the path is blocked by walls. Let me visualize the map:

Starting position (Baba) is at 4 steps right, 3 steps down. To the right, there's a wall at 4 steps right, 1 step down. Then walls going up. The key is at 8 steps right, 1 step up. So moving right from 4 to 5, 6, 7, 8. But between 4 and 8, there's a wall at 4 steps right and 1 step up, then rule door at 7 steps right and 1 step up. Maybe the door is a movable rule? If I can move the ""door"" rule, perhaps I can open a path.

Alternatively, since ""key is win"", maybe just reach the key. But how to get past the walls. The walls at 4 steps right and 1 step up, then 2 step up, etc. Maybe there's a way to override the ""wall is stop"" rule. If I can turn walls into something else, like ""wall is you"", then I can walk through them. But to do that, I need to move the ""stop"" property from wall to something else.

The ""wall is stop"" rule is at 1 step right and 3 step up. So moving that ""stop"" text block away from ""wall"" would change the immovability. For example, if I make ""stop"" apply to another object, like ""key is stop"", then walls wouldn't block. But how to move that? The player needs to move the ""stop"" rule. 

But first, I need to reach those text blocks. The ""stop"" rule is at 1 step right and 3 step up. From the player's position at 4 steps right, 3 steps down, moving up to 4 steps right, 3 step up would hit a wall. So maybe moving left or right first. Let's see:

Current position: Assume player is at the position of the ""baba"" rule, which is 1 step left and 2 steps down from the wall at 4 steps right and 2 steps down. So coordinates might be (4,2) for the wall, then ""baba"" is at (3,1), ""is"" at (2,1), ""you"" at (1,1). So player starts at (3,1).

To get to the ""stop"" rule at (1,3), need to move left three steps and up two steps. But there are walls blocking. For example, at (4,3) there's a wall. So moving up from (3,1) to (3,2) is blocked by a wall at (4,2) step up? Wait, the walls are positioned at various steps. This is getting confusing. Maybe better to focus on moving the text blocks.

The key is at 8 steps right, 1 step up. To get there, the path is blocked by walls. But if I can change the ""wall is stop"" rule, maybe I can walk through walls. For example, if I make ""wall is you"", then walls become passable. To do that, I need to move the ""stop"" property from ""wall"" to another object. 

The ""wall is stop"" rule is a text block that says ""wall is stop"". To change this, I need to move the ""stop"" part to another subject. For example, moving ""stop"" to ""key"", making ""key is stop"". Then walls wouldn't block. But to do that, I need to move the ""stop"" text block that's attached to ""wall"".

The ""stop"" rule is at 1 step right and 3 step up. So from the player's position (3,1), moving right to 4, then up to 3 step up would reach the ""stop"" rule. But there's a wall at 4 steps right and 3 step up. So can't move through walls. Unless I can push them, but the problem states that you can only move objects that are not ""STOP"" or similar. Since walls are ""STOP"", you can't move them. So this approach might not work.

Alternative idea: Use the ""key is win"" rule. Since the key is the win condition, maybe just move towards it. But path is blocked. Alternatively, move the ""win"" rule to the key's location. The ""win"" rule is at 9 steps right, 3 steps up. If I can move that to the key's position (8 steps right, 1 step up), then the key would still be the win condition. But that doesn't help. Alternatively, move the ""win"" rule to Baba's position, making ""baba is win"".

To do that, I need to move the ""win"" text block next to ""baba is you"". The ""baba is you"" rule is at 3 steps left and 2 steps down from the wall at 4 steps right and 2 steps down. So ""baba"" is at (3,1), ""is"" at (2,1), ""you"" at (1,1). The ""win"" rule is at (9,3). So moving the ""win"" block from (9,3) to (3,1) area. But how to navigate there without hitting walls.

Alternatively, maybe rearrange the text blocks to create a new rule. For example, move ""win"" next to ""baba"" and ""is"", making ""baba is win"". This would make reaching Baba the win condition. To do this, the player needs to move the ""win"" block to the ""baba is"" rule.

The ""win"" block is at 9 steps right, 3 steps up. The ""baba is"" rule is at 3 steps right (assuming starting position), so moving left from 9 to 3 steps right would require passing through obstacles. There's a wall at 4 steps right and 1 step up, then other walls. Maybe it's possible by moving around them, but the exact path is unclear.

Alternatively, focus on getting the key first. The key is at 8 steps right, 1 step up. To reach there, the player would need to move right from 4 to 5, 6, 7, 8. But between 4 and 7, there's a rule door at 7 steps right and 1 step up. Maybe the door is a movable rule. If I can move the ""door"" rule, perhaps I can use it to open a path or something. But not sure how.

Wait, the ""door"" rule is at 7 steps right and 1 step up. If I can make ""door is key"" or something, but that's not directly helpful. Alternatively, if I can make ""door is you"", then stepping on the door would make it passable. But again, need to move the text blocks.

This is getting complicated. Let me recap:

Current rules:
- Key is win: touching key wins.
- Wall is stop: can't move through walls.
- Baba is you: you control Baba.

Goals:
- Reach key or change win condition to Baba.

Possible actions:

1. Move the ""win"" rule to make Baba the win condition.
2. Move the ""stop"" rule to make walls passable.
3. Use the key to override a rule (not sure how).

To move a text block, need to be adjacent to it and move in a direction. For example, the ""win"" rule is at 9 right, 3 up. To move it left, the player must be next to it and move left.

Assuming the player is at the ""baba"" rule position (3,1), moving right towards the key. But path is blocked. Alternatively, move up towards the text blocks.

Wait, the ""key"" rule is at 7 right, 3 up. The ""is"" after it is at 8 right, 3 up. ""win"" at 9 right, 3 up. So the key is part of the ""key is win"" rule. To change the rule, need to rearrange these blocks.

If I can move the ""win"" block from the end to after ""baba is"", making ""baba is win"". To do that, the player needs to move the ""win"" block from (9,3) to near (3,1). That's a distance of 6 steps left and 2 steps down. But how to get there without obstacles.

Alternatively, maybe focus on moving the ""key"" block. If I can make ""key is you"", then the key becomes controllable. But not sure if that helps.

Another angle: The ""door"" rule is at 7 right, 1 up. If I can make ""door is win"", then reaching the door would win. But not sure.

Alternatively, since ""baba is you"", maybe push a wall if it's not ""stop"". But walls are stop, so can't move them. Unless the rule is changed.

This is tricky. Let me think step by step.

Step 1: Identify movable text blocks. The ones not part of ""stop"" or similar. The ""key"", ""is"", ""win"", ""door"", ""baba"", ""you"" rules are all movable unless they're part of a ""stop"" rule. Since ""wall is stop"", the ""wall"" text block is part of a stop rule, so can't be moved. Other rules can be moved.

So the player can move ""key"", ""is"", ""win"", ""door"", ""baba"", ""you"" blocks.

Goal: Create a new rule that makes Baba the win condition or remove the stop from walls.

Option 1: Create ""baba is win"" by moving ""win"" next to ""baba is you"".

To do this, need to move the ""win"" block from (9,3) to near (3,1). The path from (9,3) to (3,1) requires moving left 6 steps and down 2 steps. But there are walls in the way. For example, at (4,3) there's a wall. So the player would need to navigate around these walls by moving in a different path.

Alternatively, move the ""win"" block step by step. Starting at (9,3), move left to (8,3), but there's the ""key"" block at (7,3) and ""is"" at (8,3). So can't move left past them. Then move down to (9,2), but is that possible? If there's no wall at (9,2), then move down. Then left to (8,2), etc. But need to check the map layout.

The map objects are:

- Wall at 4 right, 4 up
- rule key at 7,4
- rule is at 8,4
- rule win at 9,4
- rule wall at 1 left, 3 up
- rule is at 2 left, 3 up
- rule stop at 1 right, 3 up
- wall at 4 right, 3 up
- ball at 5 right, 3 up
- wall at 4 right, 2 up
- rule door at 7 right, 2 up
- wall at 4 right, 1 up
- key at 8 right, 1 up
- wall at 4 right
- wall at 4 right, 1 down
- rule baba at 1 left, 2 down
- rule is at 2 left, 2 down
- rule you at 1 right, 2 down
- wall at 4 right, 2 down

Assuming coordinates are (x, y), with right being positive x and up being positive y.

Player's starting position is likely at the ""baba"" rule, which is at (4 -1, 3 - 2) = (3,1).

To move the ""win"" block from (9,3) to near (3,1):

1. Move from (9,3) down to (9,2). Is there a wall? At (9,2), looking at the objects, there's no wall mentioned. So possible.

2. From (9,2), move left to (8,2). The ""door"" rule is at (7,2), so (8,2) is next to it. Possible.

3. Move left to (7,2), which is the ""door"" rule. Can move there.

4. Move left to (6,2). No obstacles mentioned.

5. Continue left to (5,2), passing the ""ball"" at (5,3). But at (5,2), is there a wall? No, the wall at (4,2) is two steps left.

6. Move left to (4,2), but there's a wall at (4,2). Can't move there.

So stuck at (4,2) which is a wall. Alternative path: From (9,2), move down to (9,1). Is there a wall? At (9,1), there's a key. So can move down to (9,1).

Then move left to (8,1), which is the key. Move left to (7,1). No obstacles.

From (7,1), move up to (7,2), which is the ""door"" rule. Then move left to (6,2), etc., but still hit the wall at (4,2).

This seems challenging. Maybe another approach.

Option 2: Change the ""wall is stop"" rule to make walls passable. To do this, need to move the ""stop"" property from ""wall"" to another object. For example, make ""stop is key"" or something. But ""stop"" is part of the ""wall is stop"" rule. So to change it, need to rearrange the text blocks.

The ""wall is stop"" rule is at (1 right, 3 up). The ""stop"" here is attached to ""wall"". To move ""stop"" to another subject, say ""key"", need to create ""key is stop"" and remove ""wall is stop"". But how?

The text blocks are separate. So the ""wall is stop"" consists of ""wall"", ""is"", ""stop"". To change this, you'd need to move the ""stop"" block away from ""wall"" and attach it to another subject. For example, move ""stop"" to after ""key is"", making ""key is stop"" and ""wall is"".

But the current ""key is win"" rule is at (7,4), ""is"" at (8,4), ""win"" at (9,4). To create ""key is stop"", you'd need to insert ""stop"" after ""key is"". But the ""is"" is already used in ""key is win"". So perhaps move the ""stop"" block from (1 right, 3 up) to after ""key is"", making ""key is stop win""? That doesn't make sense. Maybe rearrange the blocks to ""key is stop"" and ""wall is"".

Alternatively, move the ""stop"" block from (1 right, 3 up) to after ""key"", creating ""key stop is ..."", but that's not a valid rule. Rules must be in the format ""[Subject] IS [Property]"".

So to create ""key is stop"", you need to have ""key"", ""is"", ""stop"" in sequence. The existing ""key is win"" is ""key"", ""is"", ""win"". So to make ""key is stop"", you need to replace ""win"" with ""stop"". But you can't edit the existing rule, only move the blocks.

So if you take the ""win"" block from the end of ""key is win"" and move it elsewhere, and move the ""stop"" block to replace it, you could create ""key is stop"" and have ""stop"" elsewhere. But this requires precise movement.

For example:

1. Move the ""win"" block from (9,4) down to (9","

Let's see. The current goal is to figure out how to move in the game Baba Is You based on the active rules and the objects present.

First, the active rules are: key is win, wall is stop, and baba is you. That means touching the key makes you win, walls are stoppable, and since Baba is You, whatever actions apply to Baba also apply to me.

Looking at the objects on the map, the key is located at 8 steps to the right. The ball is at 5 steps to the right and 2 steps up. There's a door at 7 steps to the right and 1 step up. Also, there are several walls positioned around, some labeled as stop. 

The problem is that the path to the key seems blocked. The walls are arranged such that moving directly right towards the key (which is at 8 steps right) might be possible, but I need to check if there are any stop properties in the way. The rule ""wall is stop"" means that any object labeled as a wall cannot be moved through. However, since I'm Baba and ""baba is you,"" I can potentially move over or around walls unless they are stopped by another rule. 

Wait, the active rule is ""wall is stop,"" which means that walls have the stop property. So, if there's a wall in my path, I can't move through it. But since I'm Baba (you), can I push walls? Or do I just can't move into them? The game mechanics usually allow you to move around stop objects but not through them. So, if there's a wall between me and the key, I need to find a way around it, perhaps by rearranging the rules.

Looking at the objects, the key is at 8 steps right. To get there, I need to move right multiple times. But between my current position (which isn't explicitly stated here, but based on previous steps, maybe I'm adjacent to some rules or walls) and the key, there might be walls. The rule ""wall is stop"" is present, so any wall object would block movement. 

Looking at the objects listed, there's a wall at 4 steps right, and walls at 1 step right and 1 step down, etc. But the key is at 8 steps right. The path to the right seems to have walls at 4 steps right, then 4 steps right and 1 step down, etc. So moving directly right from my current position (assuming I'm near the lower part) might hit a wall at 4 steps right. 

But how can I bypass that? The key is win, so I need to reach it. Since the key is win, touching it would make me win. But the walls are stopping. Maybe I can change the rules to remove the stop property from walls or make myself able to pass through them. 

The available text blocks on the map include the rule ""wall is stop"" at 1 step left and 2 steps up, and other rules like ""key is win,"" ""is"" blocks, etc. To change a rule, I need to move the 'is' block and rearrange the subject and property. For example, if I can move the 'wall is stop' rule to another position, like making 'stop is wall' or changing the subject, that might remove the stop property from walls. 

But to do that, I need to move the text blocks. The 'is' blocks are present at various positions. For instance, there's a rule `wall` at 1 step left and 2 steps up, then `is` at 3 step up, then `stop` at 1 step right and 3 step up. If I can take the 'is' block and rearrange it to change 'wall is stop' to something else, like 'stop is door' or 'wall is you', that could help. 

However, moving text blocks requires that they are not themselves stopped. The current active rules have 'wall is stop', so any text block that is a wall cannot be moved. Looking at the objects, the rule `wall` is at 4 step left and 3 step up, which is part of the 'wall is stop' rule. Since that rule is active, the text block labeled 'wall' is considered a wall and thus stopped. That means I can't move it. Similarly, other text blocks might be protected by the stop property. 

Wait, the 'stop' property is applied to the wall objects. So, any object that is a wall cannot be moved. The text blocks that define the rules are objects themselves. For example, the rule `wall` is a text block that is part of the 'wall is stop' rule. If that text block is a wall, then it's stoppable. So, I can't move it unless I change its property. 

This seems like a dead end. Maybe I need to focus on reaching the key by navigating around the walls using the existing rules. Alternatively, perhaps the door at 7 steps right and 1 step up is a way out. But doors are usually opened by something, like a key. The key is at 8 steps right, so if I could get to the door first, but the door might require the key to be obtained. 

Another angle: since 'baba is you', maybe I can push other objects. In some levels, you can push objects if they aren't stopped. But the rule here is 'wall is stop', so walls can't be pushed. Other objects like the ball might not be stopped, so maybe I can push them out of the way. 

Looking at the objects, there's a ball at 5 steps right and 2 steps up. If I can move the ball, perhaps that would create a path. But to push the ball, the game usually allows it if there's nothing stopping it. However, the active rules don't mention the ball having any properties, so it's likely movable. 

But how does this help me reach the key? If I can move the ball out of the way, maybe clear a path. Or perhaps use the ball to break a wall? That depends on the level's mechanics, which aren't specified here. 

Alternatively, maybe the key being defined as 'win' means that just touching it, regardless of obstacles, makes me win. But in most cases, you have to reach it without hitting a wall. 

Given that the previous actions were moving left multiple times, perhaps the agent is oscillating without making progress. The correct approach here is to figure out how to either remove the 'stop' property from walls or create a rule that allows Baba to pass through walls. 

Since the text blocks are fixed in their positions initially, the agent needs to navigate to them and rearrange. For example, moving the 'is' block that's part of 'wall is stop' to change it to 'stop is wall' or 'wall is you'. But to do that, the agent needs to move the 'is' block, which might be possible if it's not stopped. 

Looking at the objects, the 'is' blocks are present at various locations. For instance, there's an `is` block at 5 steps right and 4 step up (part of 'key is win'), another at 3 step left and 3 step up (part of 'wall is stop'), etc. If the agent can move these 'is' blocks, they can alter the rules. 

But to move an 'is' block, it must not be stopped. The 'stop' property is applied to walls, not to the 'is' blocks themselves. So, the agent (Baba) can move the 'is' blocks. 

So the plan could be: move to the 'is' block that's part of the 'wall is stop' rule (located at 3 step left and 3 step up), then reposition it to change the rule. For example, if the original rule is 'wall IS stop', moving the 'is' to make it 'stop IS wall' would invert the property, making stop objects walls, which might not affect much. Alternatively, moving the 'wall' subject to another property. 

Alternatively, the agent could create a new rule like 'baba IS stop', but that would make themselves stoppable, which is bad. Or 'baba IS win', which would make Baba the win condition, so touching anything would make them win. But the active rule is 'key IS win', so that's the current win condition. 

Another possibility: since 'baba is you', maybe changing the 'you' rule. There's a rule `you` at 2 step left and 2 steps down. If the agent can move that 'you' block and attach it to Baba, perhaps making 'baba IS you' redundant, but that might not help. 

Alternatively, creating a new rule that allows Baba to pass through walls. For example, 'baba IS not stop' or 'wall IS not stop'. But to create such a rule, the agent needs to have the necessary text blocks. 

Looking at the available objects, there's a 'door' rule at 7 steps right and 2 step up. Maybe using that? Not sure. 

The key is at 8 steps right. The path to the right seems blocked by walls at 4 steps right. To get past that, the agent might need to remove the 'stop' property from walls. To do that, they need to alter the 'wall is stop' rule. 

The 'wall is stop' rule is composed of the `wall` text block at 1 step left and 2 step up, the `is` at 2 step up, and the `stop` at 1 step right and 2 step up. To change this rule, the agent needs to move either the 'wall', 'is', or 'stop' blocks. 

Assuming the agent can move the 'is' block, they could rearrange it to make a new rule. For example, moving the 'is' to connect 'stop' with another property. But without knowing the exact positions, it's tricky. 

Alternatively, the agent could move the 'stop' block to a different part of the rule, like making 'wall IS door' or something, but that requires knowing where the door is. 

Given the time constraints and the fact that previous actions were just moving left, perhaps the correct action now is to move right towards the key, assuming that the path has been cleared or that the agent can push through. But given the walls are stop, that might not be possible. 

Wait, looking at the latest observation, after moving up, the agent's position might have changed. The key is still at 8 steps right, but the walls are at various positions. Maybe the agent is currently at 4 steps right, and needs to move right three more times. But there's a wall at 4 steps right, which is the same position as the agent? Or is the agent elsewhere? 

The observation doesn't specify the agent's position, only the objects. Assuming the agent is at the starting point, perhaps near the lower part, moving right towards the key. But the walls are in the way. 

Another approach: since the key is win, maybe the agent can push other objects to block the walls. For example, pushing the ball into the wall to create a pathway. But the ball is at 5 steps right and 2 steps up. If the agent can move the ball towards the wall at 4 steps right and 2 step up, perhaps clearing a path. 

But how to move the ball? The agent would need to push it. In Baba Is You, you can push objects by moving into them from the side. So if the agent is adjacent to the ball and moves in the direction opposite to where they want the ball to go, they can push it. 

So, if the agent is to the left of the ball and moves right, they can push the ball to the right. But the ball is at 5 steps right and 2 steps up. If the agent is at 4 steps right and 2 steps up, moving right would push the ball to 6 steps right and 2 steps up, perhaps creating a path. 

But the agent's current position isn't clear. Without knowing where the agent is, it's hard to determine the exact moves. However, based on the previous actions of moving left multiple times, maybe the agent is oscillating around the area near the rules. 

Given the lack of explicit agent position, the safest bet might be to attempt to move towards the key, checking for walls. Since the key is the win condition, and it's directly to the right, the agent should prioritize moving right. However, the presence of walls requires that a path be found. 

Alternatively, the agent could try to rearrange the 'wall is stop' rule to 'stop is wall' by moving the 'is' block. For example, taking the 'is' from 'wall is stop' and placing it between 'stop' and 'wall', making 'stop is wall'. This wouldn't change much, as stop would still be walls. Not helpful. 

Another possibility: create a new rule like 'baba is win', which would make touching Baba (yourself) the win condition. But the active rule is 'key is win', so that might not override it unless the 'key is win' rule is removed. 

To remove the 'key is win' rule, the agent would need to move the 'is' block from that rule. The 'key is win' rule is at 4 steps right and 4 step up, with 'key', 'is', 'win' in sequence. Moving the 'is' block would break that rule, making 'key win' which is invalid, thus removing the 'key is win' rule. Then, if the agent can make 'baba is win', touching themselves would win. 

But this requires navigating to that part of the map. The 'key is win' rule is up at 4 steps right and 4 step up, which is higher than the current agent's position. The agent would need to move up, but there might be walls blocking the way. 

Alternatively, if the agent can push the 'is' block from 'key is win' to another position to create a new rule. For example, moving 'is' to connect 'baba' with 'win', making 'baba is win'. The 'baba' rule is at 4 step left and 2 steps down, with 'is' at 3 step left and 2 steps down, and 'you' at 2 step left and 2 steps down. So, if the agent can move the 'is' from the 'baba you' rule to connect 'baba' with 'win', that could work. 

This would require moving the 'is' block from the 'baba is you' rule to the 'baba is win' rule. But how to do that? The agent would need to move the 'is' block from its current position (3 step left and 2 steps down) to between 'baba' and 'win'. 

Assuming the agent is near that area, moving the 'is' block there would create the new rule. Then, since 'baba is you' and 'baba is win', the win condition would apply to Baba, meaning touching anything makes the agent win. But this might not be safe if there are other stop objects. 

However, the key is still present, and if the agent can just touch it, but the path is blocked. Changing the win condition to 'baba is win' might allow the agent to win by touching themselves, which is always possible. 

So the steps could be: 

1. Move to the 'is' block in the 'baba is you' rule (at 3 step left and 2 steps down).
2. Move this 'is' block to connect 'baba' (at 4 step left and 2 steps down) with 'win' (which is at 9 steps right and 3 step up). But that's a long distance. Alternatively, find a 'win' text block. Wait, the 'win' rule is part of the 'key is win' rule at 9 steps right and 3 step up. 

This seems complicated. Maybe a better approach is to focus on moving right towards the key, avoiding walls by pushing them if possible. 

Alternatively, since the key is at 8 steps right, and there's a door at 7 steps right and 1 step up, perhaps using the door requires the key. But without the key, the door can't be opened. 

In summary, the most viable immediate action is to move right towards the key, despite the walls, hoping that the path has been cleared or that the agent can push through. However, given the 'wall is stop' rule, this might not be possible. 

Another angle: the ball at 5 steps right and 2 steps up. If the agent can move the ball out of the way, maybe creating a path. For example, push the ball to the right, towards the wall at 4 steps right and 2 step up. If the ball is pushed into the wall, perhaps it breaks the wall or moves it aside. But in standard Baba Is You mechanics, objects like walls can't be destroyed, just moved. 

So, pushing the ball into the wall at 4 steps right and 2 step up would move the ball to 6 steps right and 2 step up, potentially creating a path for the agent to move right past the wall. 

To do this, the agent would need to be adjacent to the ball and push it. Assuming the agent is at 5 steps right and 2 steps up (same as the ball), moving right would push the ball to 6 steps right and 2 steps up. Then, the agent can move right to 6 steps right and 2 steps up, avoiding the wall at 4 steps right. 

But the agent's current position isn't specified. If the agent is near the ball, this could work. 

Given the uncertainty about the agent's position, the best guess is to attempt to move right towards the key, possibly pushing the ball out of the way if adjacent. 

Alternatively, since the previous actions were moving left and failing, maybe the agent needs to try a different direction. 

After considering all options, the most logical action, assuming the agent is near the ball and can push it, is to move right to push the ball and clear a path. If not, then moving right directly towards the key, hoping there's no wall in the way. 

But given the active rules and the objects listed, the agent should try to rearrange the rules to remove the stop property from walls. The best way to do that is to alter the 'wall is stop' rule. 

To do this, the agent needs to move the 'is' block from 'wall is stop' to create a new rule. For example, changing it to 'stop is wall' doesn't help, but changing it to 'baba is not stop' would allow the agent to pass through walls. 

The 'is' block in 'wall is stop' is located at 3 step left and 3 step up. The agent would need to move this 'is' block to connect 'baba' with 'not stop' or similar. However, the 'not stop' text block isn't present on the map.

Let me try to figure out what to do here. The active rules are ""key is win"", ""wall is stop"", and ""baba is you"". So, normally, the goal is to get to the key because it's defined as win. But walls are stop, which means I can't move through them.

Looking at the objects on the map, the key is to the right at 8 steps to the right. But there's a wall at 4 steps to the right, and then the key is further right. Wait, but the rule says ""key is win"", so if I reach the key, I win. But how do I get past the walls?

The player is Baba, right? Because ""baba is you"". So I need to move Baba to the key. The key is 8 steps to the right, but there's a wall at 4 steps right, and then more walls as I move right. Maybe I need to move the text blocks to change the rules. 

Looking at the rules on the map: there's a ""key"" rule, ""is"" next to it, and ""win"" after that. So the rule is ""key IS win"". If I can move these text blocks, maybe I can change what's win. For example, if I can make ""baba IS win"", then reaching Baba (myself) would win the level. But how to do that?

First, I need to see if I can move the text blocks. The active rules say that ""wall is stop"", so any object with the stop property can't be moved. Are the text blocks stop? The rules might not specify, but usually in Baba Is You, text blocks can be moved unless they're part of a STOP rule. Since ""wall is stop"", but the text blocks are part of the rules, maybe they can be moved if they're not defined as stop. Let me check the active rules again. The only stop is wall, so the text blocks (key, is, win, etc.) should be movable.

So, the key is at 8 steps right. To get there, I need to move past walls. But maybe instead of going right, I should manipulate the rules. For example, if I can make ""baba IS win"", then I can just stay in place and win. To do that, I need to move the ""win"" text block next to ""baba"".

Looking at the current rules on the map: there's a rule at 4 steps right and 3 step up: ""key IS win"" (rule `key` at 7 right, 3 up; `is` at 8 right, 3 up; `win` at 9 right, 3 up). If I can move these blocks, maybe I can break that rule and create a new one. For instance, move the ""win"" block to be next to ""baba"".

Where is Baba located? There's a rule `baba` at 1 step left and 2 steps down from the current position (assuming the player is at 4 steps right, but the exact position might need checking). Wait, the objects list includes ""rule `baba` 1 step to the left and 2 steps down"". So the rule ""baba"" is 1 left and 2 down from the player's position. If the player is at 4 steps right, then the ""baba"" rule is at 3 steps right and 2 steps down. But how does that relate to the player's position?

Wait, the player is Baba, so their position is implied by the ""baba is you"" rule. The actual position of the player might be where the ""baba"" tile is, but in the objects list, there's a rule `baba` at 1 step left and 2 steps down. Maybe the player is at 0 steps right, and the ""baba"" rule is at -1 left (which would be 1 left) and 2 down. So the player's position is perhaps at (0,0), and the ""baba"" rule is at (-1, -2). But I'm not sure. Maybe I need to focus on the available text blocks.

To create ""baba IS win"", I need to move the ""win"" block near the ""baba"" rule. The ""win"" block is at 9 steps right and 3 step up. The ""baba"" rule is at 1 step left and 2 steps down. So the distance between them is quite large. Moving those blocks manually would take many steps, but maybe there's a smarter way.

Alternatively, maybe I can delete the existing ""key IS win"" rule and create a new rule. To delete a rule, I might need to move the ""win"" block away from ""key"" and ""is"". Then, take the ""win"" block and place it next to ""baba"" and ""is"". But how to do that given the current layout?

Another approach: The key is currently the win object. If I can pick up the key, maybe that helps. But in Baba Is You, you can't pick up objects unless there's a rule allowing it. Since ""key is win"", maybe just reaching it is enough. But the path is blocked by walls.

Looking at the map, from the player's position (assuming they're at 4 steps right, maybe?), there's a wall at 4 right, 3 up. Then the key is at 8 right. So moving right directly is blocked by walls. Maybe moving up or down could help find a path. For example, moving up to avoid the walls.

But the active rules are ""key is win"", so maybe the key's position is the goal. Alternatively, if I can make ""baba IS win"", then staying in place would work. To do that, I need to move the ""win"" text block next to ""baba"".

The ""win"" block is at 9 right, 3 up. The ""baba"" rule is at 1 left and 2 down. So the distance is quite large. Maybe I can move the ""win"" block left and down. But how?

Each move is one step in a direction. To move the ""win"" block from 9 right, 3 up to, say, 3 steps right and 3 steps down, that would take many steps. But perhaps there's a way to traverse the map and move the blocks step by step.

Alternatively, maybe interact with other rules. For example, the ""door"" rule is at 7 right, 1 up. If I can use the door to pass through, but the rule says ""wall is stop"", so unless the door is redefined, it's probably a stop as well. Not sure.

Another angle: The ""ball"" is at 5 right, 2 up. Maybe that's a distractor. The key is at 8 right, 1 up. So to get to the key, need to move right past walls at 4,5,6,7,8 steps right? Wait, looking at the objects:

- wall at 4 right,4 up
- rule `key` at7,4
- rule `is` at8,4
- rule `win` at9,4
Then lower down:
- wall at4,3
- ball at5,3
- wall at4,2
- rule `door` at7,2
- wall at4,1
- key at8,1
- wall at4,0
- walls descending below.

So the key is at 8,1. To get there from the player's position (assuming they are at 4,3, since the wall at4,3 is there, and the player is Baba), moving right from 4,3 would hit the wall at4,3. So can't go right directly. Maybe move up or down.

If I move up from 4,3 to 4,4, but there's a wall there. So that's blocked. Move down to 4,2, which is a wall. Also blocked. So maybe move left to 3,3. Then from there, see if there's a path.

But the player is Baba, which is governed by ""baba is you"". So the player's position might be where the ""baba"" rule is, which is at 1 step left and 2 steps down from somewhere. Wait, the objects list includes ""rule `baba` 1 step to the left and 2 steps down"". So if the player is at position (x,y), the ""baba"" rule is at (x-1, y-2). But where is the player exactly? This is a bit confusing without a visual.

Alternatively, maybe the player is at the position where the ""baba"" tile is, but in the objects list, the ""baba"" rule is a text block, not the actual Baba tile. In Baba Is You, the player is represented by the ""BABA"" tile, which is separate from the text blocks. But the rule ""baba is you"" makes that tile controllable.

Assuming the player is on a ""BABA"" tile, perhaps located near the ""baba"" rule text block. The ""baba"" rule is at 1 step left and 2 steps down from the player's position. So if the player is at (4,3), then the ""baba"" rule would be at (3,1). Not sure. This is getting complicated.

Let me try to outline possible steps:

1. The goal is to reach the key, which is defined as win. But the path is blocked by walls.
2. Alternatively, change the rule to make ""baba"" the win, so the player can win by staying still.
3. To change the rule, need to move the ""win"" text block next to ""baba"" and ""is"".
4. The ""win"" block is at 9 right,3 up. The ""baba"" rule is at 1 left,2 down. The ""is"" block is at various positions depending on existing rules.
5. The existing ""key IS win"" rule is at 7,4; 8,4;9,4. need to move these blocks apart to break the rule.
6. Then take the ""win"" block and move it to near ""baba"" and ""is"".

But moving the ""win"" block from 9,4 to, say, 3,3 (near ""baba"" rule at 1,-2) would require moving left and down multiple steps. Each move can only move one step at a time. Also, need to ensure that while moving, the blocks aren't blocked by ""stop"" walls.

Alternatively, maybe there's a shorter path. For example, move the ""win"" block down to 9,3, then left to 8,3, etc., until it's near the ""baba"" rule.

But considering the layout:

- At 4 right,3 up: wall
- At 5 right,3 up: ball
- At 6 right,3 up: ?
- At 7 right,3 up: rule `key`
- At 8 right,3 up: rule `is`
- At 9 right,3 up: rule `win`

So the ""win"" block is to the far right. To move it left, I need to navigate around the wall at4 right,3 up. Maybe move up to 4,4 (which is a wall), can't. Move down to 4,2 (wall). Move left to3,3. From there, move up to3,4, but is that allowed? If I can move left past the wall at4,3, then to3,3, then perhaps proceed.

But the player's position is unclear. Assuming the player is at4,3 (next to the wall), they can't move right. So perhaps move left to3,3, then up to3,4, but need to check if that's possible.

If the player is at3,3, then they can move up to3,4. But what's at3,4? Looking at the objects, there's no wall mentioned there except the ones at4 steps right. So maybe it's free.

Once at3,3, the player can move left, right, up, or down. From there, they can try to move the ""win"" block by pushing it, but since ""wall is stop"", and the ""win"" block isn't a wall, maybe they can move it if it's not locked.

This seems complicated. Maybe a better approach is to first break the ""key IS win"" rule. To do that, move the ""win"" block away from ""key"" and ""is"". For example, move the ""win"" block down to9,3. Then the rule would be ""key IS is"", which is invalid, breaking the original rule.

Once that's done, take the ""win"" block and move it to near ""baba"" and ""is"". The ""is"" blocks are at8,4 and others. So after breaking the key rule, move the ""win"" to, say, 2,4 (near ""baba"" rule at1,-2). This would create ""baba IS win"", making the player win.

But how to physically move the blocks? Each move can carry one text block if it's adjacent. So from the ""win"" block at9,4, move left to8,4 (which is ""is""), but can't place it there because it's part of the existing rule. So need to move it further left.

Alternatively, move the ""win"" block down to9,3. Then left to8,3 (which is ""is"" from the key rule?), no. Wait, the ""is"" at8,4 is part of the ""key IS win"" rule. If I move the ""win"" down to9,3, then the ""key IS"" remains, but ""win"" is separate. Then I can take the ""win"" block from9,3 and move it left across the map.

This requires multiple steps. For example:

1. Move from player's position (assuming near the ""baba"" rule) to the ""win"" block at9,4.
2. Move left along the upper part of the map, avoiding walls.
3. Once the ""win"" block is near the ""baba"" rule, place it there to create ""baba IS win"".

But this is a lot of steps and requires navigating past several walls. Given the previous failed attempts, maybe the assistant isn't finding the correct path quickly.

Another observation: The key is at8,1. If the player can reach there, they win. But the path is blocked by walls at4,1;7,2; etc. Maybe there's a way around by moving up or down.

From the key at8,1, to get there, the player would need to move right from4,3 (assuming) past walls at4,3;5,3; etc. But those are walls. Unless there's a rule that allows moving through them, which there isn't since ""wall is stop"".

Alternatively, use the ""door"" rule. The door is at7,2. If the door can be made passable, but the rule is ""wall is stop"", and unless ""door"" is redefined, it's probably a wall. Not sure.

Wait, the rule ""door"" is just a text block; it doesn't have a property unless defined. So if there's no rule like ""door IS stop"", then the door can be moved through. But the active rules only have ""wall is stop"", ""key is win"", and ""baba is you"". So the door is not stopped, meaning the player can move through it. That's a key insight!

So the door at7,2 is not a stop, so the player can move through it. If the path to the key goes through the door, that could work. Let's see:

Player needs to go from their position (assuming near4,3) to8,1. The path right is blocked by walls at4,3;5,3;6,3;7,3 (since rule `door` is at7,2, which is down one from7,3). So from4,3, moving right to5,3 (ball), but that's a ball, not a wall. Can the player move through the ball? Unless there's a rule like ""ball is stop"", which there isn't. So maybe the player can move through the ball.

Wait, the active rules don't mention ball as stop, so the player can move over the ball. So the path could be:

4,3 (player) ->5,3 (ball) ->6,3 ->7,3 (door) ->8,3 ->8,2 ->8,1 (key)

But need to check if those moves are possible.

From4,3 to5,3: possible, since no stop rule. Then5,3 to6,3: no wall mentioned. Then6,3 to7,3: the door is at7,2, so7,3 is a wall? Wait, the objects list has ""rule `door` 7 steps to the right and 2 step up"", which is7,2. So7,3 would be one step down from the door rule, which is just a tile, not a wall. Unless the door is part of a wall, but there's no rule saying ""door IS wall"". So7,3 is passable.

Then from7,3 to8,3: no obstacle. Then8,3 to8,2: key is at8,1, so8,2 is one step up from the key. Then8,2 to8,1: reach the key.

This path seems possible. So the steps would be:

1. Move right from4,3 to5,3.
2. Continue right to6,3.
3. Right to7,3.
4. Right to8,3.
5. Down to8,2.
6. Down to8,1 (key).

But wait, the door is at7,2. When moving through7,3, does the door affect anything? Since there's no rule about door being stop, the player can move through it. So this path should work.

But why didn't the previous actions work? Maybe the assistant wasn't considering the door as passable. So the correct action here would be to move right repeatedly until reaching the key, using the door as a passage.

So the first move should be to the right.

I need to figure out how to get to the key, which is acting as the win condition. The active rules are key is win, wall is stop, and baba is you. So, my goal is to reach the key, which is now the win object.

Looking at the current observation, the key is 7 steps to the right. I'm currently positioned at the same starting point as before, probably at 4 steps right. Wait, the objects on the map show the key at 8 steps to the right and 1 step up initially, but after moving left multiple times, maybe my position has shifted. The key is now 7 steps to the right. So I need to move right towards it.

But there are walls blocking the path. The walls are at 3 steps right and 1 step up, and other walls further down. Also, the rule `door` is at 7 steps to the right and 1 step up. Wait, doors are usually passable unless there's a 'stop' rule. Since wall is stop, but door isn't listed as stop, maybe I can go through the door. However, the key is behind the door. So if I can move right past the door, I can get the key. But how?

Let me check the objects again. The key is at 7 steps to the right. The door is at 7 steps right and 1 step up. So the key is directly to the right of the door? Or is the door in the way? Maybe I need to move right past the door. But since I'm a Baba (since baba is you), and the door's rule isn't 'stop', I can probably pass through it. So moving right towards the key should work.

But wait, when I move right, am I going to hit a wall? The walls are at 3 steps right and 1 step up, but the key is at 7 steps right. So moving right from my current position (which was 4 steps right, but after moving left multiple times, maybe I'm now at 3 steps right?) Hmm, the exact positions might be a bit confusing. Let me parse the observation again.

Looking at the objects:

- The key is at 7 steps to the right.
- The door is at 7 steps to the right and 1 step up.
- There's a wall at 3 steps to the right and 1 step up.

So if I'm currently at 3 steps right, moving right once would take me to 4 steps right. But there's a wall at 3 steps right and 1 step up. Wait, but I'm a Baba, and walls are stop. So if I'm on the same position as a wall, I can't move through it. But the wall is at 3 steps right and 1 step up. If I'm moving horizontally, like right, maybe the wall is above or below me. So I need to check my current position.

Wait, the active rules are still key is win, wall is stop, and baba is you. So I am Baba, and I can move unless there's a wall in the way. The walls are at various positions. Let me see the objects again:

- wall 3 steps to the right and 3 step up
- rule `key` 6 steps to the right and 3 step up
- etc.

This is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I need to visualize the map.

Assuming I'm at the starting position, which might be at 0 steps right, but after moving left multiple times, perhaps I'm now at 1 step left? Or maybe the positions are relative. Alternatively, maybe the key is to the right, and I need to navigate past the walls.

Wait, looking at the current objects after moving right once:

- The key is at 7 steps to the right.
- The door is at 7 steps right and 1 step up.
- There's a wall at 3 steps right and 1 step up.

If I need to get to the key at 7 steps right, I need to move right past any obstacles. The walls are at 3 steps right and 1 step up, but that's above the path. So moving right from my current position (let's say I'm at 4 steps right, based on previous observations) to 5, 6, 7 steps right. But between me and the key, the only obstacle is the door at 7 steps right and 1 step up. However, the door's position is diagonally one step up from the key. So the key is directly to the right of the door. That means to get to the key, I need to move right past the door. Since the door isn't a stop, I can pass through it. So moving right towards the key should work.

But wait, how do I know my current position? The observation lists the key at 7 steps right, but my position isn't explicitly stated. However, since the previous actions were moving left multiple times, and now the key is further right, I must be moving towards it. So the next logical step is to move right once to get closer.

Alternatively, maybe there's a wall blocking the path. Let's check the walls. The walls are at 3 steps right and 1 step up, 3 steps right and 3 step up, etc. If I'm moving right from, say, 4 steps to 5, 6, 7, there are no walls in between except possibly at 3 steps. So moving right should be possible.

Another possibility is that the door is a barrier, but since it's not marked as stop, I can go through it. So moving right towards the key, passing through the door, and then grabbing the key, which makes me win.

Therefore, the best action is to move right.

Let's see where I am in this Baba Is You level. The active rules are still key is win, wall is stop, and baba is you. My goal is usually to reach the key or whatever is defined as win. Right now, key is win, so I need to get to the key.

Looking at the objects on the map, the key is at 6 steps to the right. But there's a wall blocking the path at 2 steps to the right and 1 step up. Wait, the wall is 2 steps to the right and 1 step up, and the key is at 6 steps right. So the path to the key is clear except maybe for those walls listed. Let me parse the objects again.

There's a wall at 4 steps right and 1 step up, another at 3 steps right and 1 step up. The key is at 6 steps right on the same horizontal line (assuming up/down steps don't block horizontal movement). But between me and the key, there's a wall at 5 steps right and 1 step up. Wait, no—the key is at 6 steps right, and the door is at 5 steps right and 1 step up. The door might be movable if I can change its rule. But right now, the active rules don't say anything about door being stop or movable. The door is just there.

But how do I move past the walls? The current rules say wall is stop, so I can't move through them. Unless I can change the 'wall is stop' rule. To do that, I need to move the 'wall' text block so that it's no longer paired with 'stop'. For example, if I move 'wall' next to 'stop', maybe I can make wall not stop. But looking at the current setup:

The 'wall' rule is at 3 step to the left and 2 step up, paired with 'is' and 'stop' at 1 step left and 2 step up. So the rule is ""wall is stop"". To break this, I need to move either the 'wall' text block or the 'stop' text block away from their pairing.

The 'you' rule is at rule `baba` 3 step to the left and 3 steps down, which is probably making baba the player. So I'm controlling baba.

Looking at the positions, the key is 6 steps to the right. But between me (assuming I'm at the baba rule, which is at 3 step to the left and 3 steps down?) and the key, there are walls and other objects. Wait, the current position of the player (Baba) is determined by the 'baba is you' rule. The 'baba' text block is at 3 step to the left and 3 steps down. So my position is 3 steps left and 3 steps down from where? Maybe the reference point is the center, but the exact coordinates might be tricky. 

Alternatively, perhaps the player is at the position of the 'baba' rule text block. So if the 'baba' rule is at 3 steps left and 3 steps down, then moving right would move me towards the key. But the walls are in the way. For example, there's a wall at 2 steps right and 1 step up, and another at 4 steps right and 1 step up. The key is at 6 steps right. So if I can move past those walls, I can get to the key.

But since walls are stop, I need to find a way around them. Maybe by rearranging the rules. The key is win, so if I can get to the key, that's the goal. But the path is blocked. Let's check the objects again.

The door is at 5 steps right and 1 step up. If I can change the door's property, maybe make it not a stop. But the current active rules don't mention door. So perhaps moving the 'door' text block into a different rule. For example, if I make 'door is you', then I could push the door. But I need to see where the door's rule is. The door is a rule at 7 steps right and 2 step up in the initial setup, but after some moves, its position might have changed.

Wait, in the latest observation, the door is at 5 steps to the right and 1 step up. The rule for door is probably not active unless it's part of a rule like ""door is stop"" or something. But in the active rules, only key is win, wall is stop, and baba is you. So the door isn't blocked by any rule; it's just a static object. So maybe I can push past it?

But walls are the problem. The walls at 2 steps right and 1 step up, 3 steps right and 1 step up, etc. To move past them, I need to either make them not stop or find a way to move around. Since I can only move objects that aren't stop, maybe if I can remove the 'stop' property from walls.

To do that, I need to break the ""wall is stop"" rule. The 'wall' text block is at 3 step to the left and 2 step up, and the 'stop' is at 1 step to the left and 2 step up. So the rule is formed by 'wall' [is] [stop]. To break this, I need to move either 'wall' or 'stop' away from their pairing.

If I can move the 'stop' text block, then the ""wall is stop"" rule would be broken. Let's see where the 'stop' rule is. In the current observation, the rule 'stop' is at 1 step to the left and 2 step up. So it's adjacent to 'is' and 'wall', forming the rule. If I can move the 'stop' block to a different position, maybe next to something else, that rule would be broken.

But to move the 'stop' block, I need to be able to move it. The movement is allowed if the object isn't stop. Since 'stop' is a property, but the text block itself isn't stopped unless it's part of a rule. The 'stop' text block here is part of the ""wall is stop"" rule, but the text block itself isn't stopped; it's the walls that are stopped. So I can move the 'stop' text block if it's not surrounded by other stop objects.

Looking at the current map, the 'stop' rule is at 1 step to the left and 2 step up. The surrounding objects might not be stop, so I can push the 'stop' block. If I move it left or right, that could break the ""wall is stop"" rule, making walls not stop. Then I could walk through them.

So the plan is: move the 'stop' text block away from the 'wall' and 'is' to break the rule, then go around the walls to reach the key.

But how to reach the 'stop' block? My current position is at the 'baba' rule, which is 3 step to the left and 3 steps down. Let's see the coordinates. The 'baba' rule is at 3 step to the left and 3 steps down. So if I need to move right to reach the 'stop' block at 1 step to the left and 2 step up, I need to calculate the direction.

Wait, maybe the coordinates are relative. For example, if the player is at position (0,0), then other objects are positioned relative to that. But without knowing the exact grid, it's a bit tricky. Alternatively, perhaps the 'baba' rule is at a certain position, and I need to move towards the 'stop' block.

Assuming the 'baba' rule is at (3 left, 3 down), which would be coordinates (-3, -3) if the player is at (0,0). The 'stop' rule is at 1 step to the left and 2 step up from where? Maybe from the 'baba' rule's position. So the 'stop' block would be at (-4, -1) if the 'baba' is at (-3, -3). To move there, I need to go left and up.

But maybe it's better to visualize the grid. Let's list out the positions:

- rule `baba` is at 3 step to the left and 3 steps down. So if the player is at (0,0), this rule is at (-3, -3).

- wall at 2 steps to the right and 2 step up: (2,2)
- ball at 3 steps to the right and 2 step up: (3,2)
- etc.

This is getting complex. Maybe the key is to move the 'stop' block. To do that, I need to navigate to where the 'stop' rule is located. The 'stop' rule is at 1 step to the left and 2 step up from the 'baba' rule's position. So from (-3, -3), moving left 1 step would be (-4, -3), then up 2 steps to (-4, -1). But the 'stop' rule is at (-5, 2) according to the observation. Wait, no, the observation says the rule `stop` is at 1 step to the left and 2 step up. Wait, the observation's exact wording is:

""rule `stop` 1 step to the left and 2 step up""

But relative to what? Probably relative to the 'baba' rule's position. So 'baba' is at 3 left and 3 down. Adding 1 left (total 4 left) and 2 up (total 1 up)? Or is it 1 left from the previous position? This is unclear without a grid reference.

Alternatively, perhaps all positions are relative to the player's position. If the player is at (0,0), then:

- The 'baba' rule is at (-3, -3)
- The 'is' next to it is at (-4, -3)
- The 'you' is at (-5, -3)
- Then, moving right and up, the walls and other rules are positioned accordingly.

The 'stop' rule is at 1 step to the left and 2 step up from where? Maybe from the 'baba' rule's position. So left 1 from (-3, -3) is (-4, -3), then up 2 would be (-4, -1). But according to the observation, the 'stop' rule is at 1 step to the left and 2 step up, which would place it at (-4, -1). But in the current observation, the 'stop' rule is listed as ""rule `stop` 1 step to the left and 2 step up"". So its position is (-4, -1) if the player is at (0,0).

To reach the 'stop' rule, I need to move from my current position (which is at the 'baba' rule, (-3, -3)) to (-4, -1). How?

The movement directions are up, down, left, right. Each step moves one position.

From (-3, -3):

- To get to (-4, -1), I need to move left once and up twice.

But the path might be blocked. Let's see the objects around:

Looking at the objects near (-3, -3):

- The 'baba' rule is here.
- To the left (at -4, -3) is the 'is' rule.
- Above (at -3, -2) is nothing mentioned, but there might be walls or other objects.

But wait, in the current observation, the walls are listed as:

wall 2 steps to the right and 3 step up: which would be (2,3) from (0,0)
wall 3 steps to the right and 3 step up: (3,3)
wall 4 steps to the right and 3 step up: (4,3)
And so on.

But closer to the player's position, there might be walls at (-1, 0) or similar. However, the observation doesn't list walls in that area. It lists walls at positions like (2,3), (3,3), etc.

So perhaps the path from (-3, -3) to (-4, -1) is clear. Let's check:

From (-3, -3):

1. Move left to (-4, -3): there's an 'is' rule there. Can I move left into that? The 'is' rule is a text block. Since 'is' isn't defined as stop, I can move into it. But moving left from (-3, -3) would take me to (-4, -3), which is the 'is' rule. Then from there, move up twice.

2. From (-4, -3), move up to (-4, -2). Is there a wall there? The observation doesn't mention any walls in that area. Then move up again to (-4, -1), which is the 'stop' rule.

Once I'm at (-4, -1) with the 'stop' rule, I can move it. To break the ""wall is stop"" rule, I need to move either 'wall' or 'stop'. The 'stop' is here, so moving it away from the 'wall' and 'is' that form the rule.

The current rule for 'wall is stop' is formed by the 'wall' text block at (-3, 2), 'is' at (-4, 2), and 'stop' at (-5, 2). Wait, no. According to the observation, the 'wall' rule is at 3 step to the left and 2 step up from the 'baba' rule. So if 'baba' is at (-3, -3), then 3 left is (-6, -3), and 2 up is (-6, -1). Wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe I need to re-express all positions relative to the player's position (0,0).

Alternatively, perhaps the coordinates are absolute, but without a visual grid, it's hard to tell. Maybe a better approach is to focus on the positions given in the observation.

The key is at 5 steps to the right and 3 step up. The player (Baba) is at the position of the 'baba' rule, which is 3 step to the left and 3 steps down. So to reach the key, the player needs to move right and up.

But the wall at 2 steps right and 3 step up is blocking the path. If I can make walls not stop, then I can walk through them.

So the priority is to break the ""wall is stop"" rule. To do that, move the 'stop' text block away.

The 'stop' text block is currently at 1 step to the left and 2 step up from wherever. According to the observation, it's at ""rule `stop` 1 step to the left and 2 step up"". Assuming this is relative to the 'baba' rule's position (3 left, 3 down), then the 'stop' block is at 3 left +1 left = 4 left, and 3 down +2 up = 1 up. So position (-4, 1) if the player is at (0,0).

To reach (-4, 1), the player needs to move left and up from their current position (which is at the 'baba' rule, 3 left and 3 down, so position (-3, -3)).

Movement steps:

1. From (-3, -3), move left to (-4, -3) — this is the 'is' rule. Since 'is' isn't stop, can move there.
2. From (-4, -3), move up to (-4, -2). No walls mentioned here.
3. From (-4, -2), move up to (-4, -1). This is the 'stop' rule.
4. Now, with the 'stop' rule at (-4, -1), need to move it. Can I push it? The 'stop' rule itself isn't stopped unless part of a rule. Since it's a text block, and the only rule involving it is ""wall is stop"", which would be broken once moved, I can move it.

So move the 'stop' rule to a new position, say, to the right. For example, move it one step to the right to (-3, -1). This would break the ""wall is stop"" rule because the 'stop' is no longer adjacent to 'wall' and 'is'.

Once that's done, walls are no longer stop, so I can walk through them.

After breaking the rule, the path to the key is clear. The key is at 5 steps right and 3 step up. From the player's position (-3, -3), moving right 8 steps and up 6 steps would reach the key. But moving through the walls that were previously blocking the path.

Alternatively, since walls are no longer stop, I can go around them or through them.

So the steps would be:

1. Move to the 'stop' rule.
2. Move the 'stop' rule away to break ""wall is stop"".
3. Move towards the key, now that walls are passable.

But how to execute this in the game? Each action is a single move. So first, navigate to the 'stop' block.

From the current position (assuming 'baba' is at 3 left, 3 down), moving left once to get to the 'is' rule, then up twice to reach the 'stop' rule.

Then, move the 'stop' rule. To move a text block, you have to be adjacent to it and push it in a direction. Since 'stop' is at (-4, -1), and I'm at (-4, -1) after moving up, I can push it. Let's say I move it right to (-3, -1). This would break the ""wall is stop"" rule.

Once that's","

Let's see. I need to figure out how to get past this level in Baba Is You. The active rules are key is win, wall is stop, and baba is you. My goal is usually to reach the win object, which right now is the key. But the key is blocked by walls and maybe some other obstacles.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ball at 5 steps to the right and 3 steps up. Wait, no, let me check again. The objects are listed with their positions relative to where? I guess the player's current position is the reference point. Let me parse each object's position:

- Wall 2 steps to the right and 3 step up
- Rule `key` at 5 right, 3 up
- Rule `is` at 6 right, 3 up
- Rule `win` at 7 right, 3 up
- Rule `wall` at 3 left, 2 up
- Rule `is` at 2 left, 2 up
- Rule `stop` at 1 left, 2 up
- Wall 2 right, 2 up
- Ball 3 right, 2 up
- Wall 2 right, 1 up
- Rule `door` at 5 right, 1 up
- Wall 2 right
- Key at 6 right
- Wall 2 right, 1 down
- Wall 2 right, 2 down
- Rule `baba` at 3 left, 3 down
- Rule `is` at 2 left, 3 down
- Rule `you` at 1 left, 3 down
- Wall 2 right, 3 down

So the key is at 6 steps to the right. But there's a wall at 2 right, and then walls at 5 right, 6 right (key), etc. Wait, the key is at 6 steps right, but there's a wall at 2 right, 3 up (the first wall), then more rules. The key is directly to the right of the wall at 2 right. But the active rule says wall is stop, so I can't move through walls. Unless I can change the rules.

The player is probably at position 0,0. To get to the key at 6 right, I need to move right past the walls. But the wall at 2 right is blocking the path. Wait, but maybe there's a way to rearrange the rules. The key is win, so if I can get the key, I win. But the key is behind a wall. The rule `door` is at 5 right, 1 up. Not sure how that helps yet.

The rules on the map include ""key is win"", ""wall is stop"", and ""baba is you"". The player is Baba, so since baba is you, moving Baba around is possible unless blocked by stop (wall). So the challenge is moving past the walls.

Looking at the rules scattered around, maybe I can move them to change the rules. For example, if I can move the ""stop"" rule somewhere else, then walls wouldn't be stop anymore. But the rules that are stop are the ones labeled with `stop`, right? So the rule `stop` at 1 left, 2 up. If I can move that rule, maybe I can make walls not stop.

Alternatively, maybe create a new rule that makes Baba able to move through walls. For example, ""baba is not stop"" or ""wall is not stop"". But to do that, I need to manipulate the existing rules.

Let me see the positions of the rules. The rule `key` is at 5 right, 3 up. Rule `is` at 6 right, 3 up. Rule `win` at 7 right, 3 up. So those three form ""key is win"" horizontally. Similarly, the rule `wall` at 3 left, 2 up, rule `is` at 2 left, 2 up, rule `stop` at 1 left, 2 up. So that's ""wall is stop"". The other rules at the bottom are ""baba is you"".

The ball is at 3 right, 2 up. Maybe the ball is a movable object? But in Baba Is You, usually, objects like balls can be pushed if they're not stopped. But since wall is stop, and if there's a wall behind the ball, you can't push it. Let's check around the ball. There's a wall at 2 right, 2 up. So the ball is next to a wall. So you can't push the ball past the wall.

So, maybe the way to go is to rearrange the ""wall is stop"" rule. If I can move the `stop` rule away, then walls wouldn't be stop anymore, and I could walk through them. Let's see where the `stop` rule is located: 1 step to the left and 2 steps up. So if I can push that `stop` rule somewhere else, maybe to the side, then walls wouldn't be stop.

To move the `stop` rule, I need to be adjacent to it and push it. The `stop` rule is at 1 left, 2 up. So relative to the player's position (which I'm assuming is at 0,0), that's 1 left (so position -1, 2). But how do I get there? The player might be blocked by walls. Wait, the player is Baba, and since baba is you, the player can move unless blocked by stop (wall). So to move towards the `stop` rule at 1 left, 2 up, I need to navigate past the walls.

Looking at the walls: at 2 right, 3 up; 2 right, 2 up; etc. Maybe the player is starting at position (0,0), and needs to move right to reach the area where the rules are. Let's try to map out a possible path.

Alternatively, maybe the player is at a different starting position. But since the observations don't specify the player's location, I have to assume based on the objects. The key is at 6 right, so maybe the player is somewhere to the left.

But this is getting complicated. Let me try to focus. The main goal is to get the key, which is win. The key is at 6 right, but there's a wall at 2 right. The rule `door` is at 5 right, 1 up. Not sure. Maybe the door is unlocked or can be used once the key is obtained.

Alternatively, perhaps the solution is to change the rule ""key is win"" to something else. For example, if I can make ""baba is win"", then reaching Baba would make him win. But to do that, I need to move the `win` rule to attach to Baba.

The `win` rule is at 7 right, 3 up. The `baba` rule is at 3 left, 3 down. So if I can move the `win` rule and attach it to `baba`, then ""baba is win"" would be active, making the player win upon touching themselves. But moving the `win` rule would require being adjacent to it and pushing it.

The `win` rule is at 7 right, 3 up. To get there, the player would have to move right past the walls. But the path is blocked by walls at 2 right, 3 up; 3 right, 3 up (no, the wall at 2 right, 3 up, then next is rule `key` at 5 right, 3 up). Wait, maybe the layout is such that the rules are in a horizontal line: key - is - win at 3 up. Similarly, wall - is - stop at 2 up. And baba - is - you at 3 down.

So the player might be somewhere below, at 3 down, near the baba rules. To reach the `win` rule at 7 right, 3 up, the player would have to navigate up and right, but there are walls in the way.

Alternatively, maybe the solution is to push the `stop` rule off the grid, effectively removing the ""wall is stop"" rule. If that's done, then walls would no longer be stop, and the player could move through them. To do that, the `stop` rule is at 1 left, 2 up. The player would need to move left and up to get to that rule, but there's a wall at 2 left, 2 up (rule `wall` at 3 left, 2 up, which is 1 left from the original position? Wait, the rule `wall` is at 3 step to the left and 2 step up. So from the player's position (0,0), that's (-3, 2). Then the `is` rule is at 2 left, 2 up (-2,2), and `stop` at 1 left, 2 up (-1,2). So the player would have to move left past the wall at -3,2 to reach -1,2 where the `stop` rule is. But how?

The wall at -3,2 is part of the ""wall is stop"" rule. Since wall is stop, the player can't move through it. So unless the player can change the rule, they can't get past that wall. This seems like a dead end.

Another approach: if the player can make themselves not stop, but that's covered by changing the rules. For example, if the player can create ""baba is not stop"", then they could walk through walls. To do that, they would need to move the `not stop` property somewhere, but I don't see a `not` rule in the current setup.

Wait, the existing rules are ""key is win"", ""wall is stop"", and ""baba is you"". There's no negation. But in Baba Is You, you can create negations by combining rules. For example, if you have ""wall is stop"" and then ""flag is not stop"", but in this case, the player might need to rearrange existing rules.

Alternatively, if the player can move the ""stop"" rule away, then walls wouldn't be stop anymore. So the plan is: move the `stop` rule (at 1 left, 2 up) to a different position, say, next to a wall, making the rule ""wall is [nothing]"". Then walls wouldn't be stop.

To move the `stop` rule, the player needs to be adjacent to it. The `stop` rule is at (-1, 2) assuming the player is at (0,0). But to get to (-1,2), the player has to move left through possibly blocked paths. Looking at the walls around there: at (-3,2) there's a wall (rule `wall`), then at (-2,2) there's an `is` rule, and at (-1,2) is the `stop` rule. So the player would have to move left from (0,0) past the walls. But how? The wall at (-3,2) is part of the ""wall is stop"" rule, so it's a stop. The player can't move left past that wall unless they can change the rule.

This seems tricky. Maybe another approach: use the ball to push something. The ball is at (3,2). If the player can push the ball into a position that allows moving rules. But the ball is next to a wall at (2,2), so can't push it further right. It can maybe be pushed left, but that would just move it into another wall at (1,2), which is the `stop` rule's position. Not helpful.

Alternatively, the door at (5,1) might be relevant. If the door is locked, maybe the key is needed. But the key is at (6,0). Wait, the key is at 6 steps to the right, which is (6,0) if the player is at (0,0). But there's a wall at (2,0), then more walls. So to get to the key at (6,0), the player would have to go around the walls. But the walls are at (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (2,0), etc. So the path to the key is blocked by a wall at (2,0). Unless the player can move that wall's rule.

The rule `wall` is at (-3,2). If the player can move that `wall` rule, they could remove the wall at (2,0). But moving the `wall` rule from (-3,2) to somewhere else. For example, pushing it to (-4,2), which would remove the wall rule at (-3,2), but then the wall at (2,0) would still exist because the rule is gone. Wait, no. The walls on the map are separate objects. The rule `wall` at (-3,2) defines that wherever that rule is placed, it creates a wall. So if the player moves the `wall` rule away, the existing walls wouldn't disappear; only new walls would stop being created where the rule was. But the existing walls are still there. So that might not help.

This is getting really complicated. Maybe the solution is simpler. Since the key is win, and it's at (6,0), maybe the player can reach it by moving right past the walls. Let's see the path from (0,0) to (6,0):

- (0,0) -> right to (1,0): but is there a wall at (1,0)? Looking at the objects, there's a wall at 2 steps right, which is (2,0). So (1,0) is free? The objects listed are walls at specific positions. The wall at 2 steps right and 4 up, etc. So the walls are at (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (2,0), and others. So from (0,0) to (1,0): free. Then (1,0) to (2,0): blocked by wall. So can't go straight right.

Alternative path: up then right. From (0,0) move up to (0,1). Is there a wall there? Looking at the objects, there's a wall at 2 steps right and 1 step up, which is (2,1). So (0,1) is free. Then move right to (1,1), which is free. Then up to (1,2). Is there a wall there? At (2,2) there's a wall. So (1,2) is free. Then right to (2,2): blocked by wall. Hmm.

Alternatively, move up to (0,3). Is there a wall there? At (2,3) there's a wall. So (0,3) is free. Then right to (1,3), (2,3): blocked. Not helpful.

This seems impossible. Maybe the solution is to change the rule ""key is win"" to ""baba is win"", so that touching Baba makes you win. To do that, the player needs to move the `win` rule to attach to `baba`.

The `win` rule is at (7,3), and `baba` is at (-3,3). So the player would need to move the `win` rule from (7,3) to near `baba` at (-3,3). But the distance is huge. The player would have to navigate from (0,0) all the way to (7,3), which is blocked by walls.

Alternatively, maybe there's a shorter path. Let's think again. The `win` rule is part of the horizontal rule ""key is win"" at (5,3), (6,3), (7,3). To move the `win` rule, the player needs to be adjacent to it. Suppose the player can get to (7,3) by moving right past the walls. But the path is blocked by walls at (2,3), (3,3), etc. Not possible.

Another idea: use the `is` rules to create new rules. For example, if the player can create ""baba is win"" by combining `baba`, `is`, and `win`. The `is` rules are scattered around. The closest `is` rule is at (6,3) and (8,3) for the ""key is win"" line, and at (-1,2), (0,2), etc., for the ""wall is stop"" line, and at (-2,3), (-1,3) for the ""baba is you"" line.

If the player can gather `baba`, `is`, and `win` together, they can form the new rule. But `win` is at (7,3), which is far away. The player would need to move the `win` rule there, which requires overcoming the wall blockade.

This seems really challenging. Maybe there's a different approach. Since the key is win, and it's behind a wall, perhaps the solution is to make the key not a win anymore, and instead make something else a win. For example, if the player can change ""key is win"" to ""door is win"", then going to the door would win the game. The door is at (5,1). But how to do that?

To change ""key is win"" to ""door is win"", the player needs to move the `win` rule from the key to the door. The `win` rule is at (7,3). The door is at (5,1). The player would have to move the `win` rule from (7,3) to (5,1), which is a distance of 2 left and 2 down. To do that, the player would need to navigate through the grid, possibly pushing the `win` rule over the walls.

But the path from (7,3) to (5,1) is blocked by walls. For example, at (6,3) there's a `key` rule, (5,3) is `is`, (4,3) is a wall, etc. So it's not possible to move the `win` rule directly there.

I'm stuck. Maybe I need to think outside the box. What if the player can push the `key` rule to create a new ""key is win"" elsewhere, but that doesn't help. Alternatively, maybe the player can make ""you is win"", but the `you` rule is at (1,3) steps down, which is (-1,3) if the player is at (0,0). So forming ""you is win"" would require moving `you` and `win` together.

The `you` rule is at (1 step to the right and 2 steps down), which is (1, -2). The `win` rule is at (7,3). That's a long way. Not feasible.

Another possibility: since the ball is present, maybe","

Let's try to figure out what to do here. The goal is to get to the key, which is currently acting as the win condition. But the active rules are ""key is win"", ""wall is stop"", and ""baba is you"". So, if I grab the key, I win. But how do I get there?

Looking at the map, I need to move around the walls. The walls are all labeled as stop, so I can't push them or walk into them. Let me check my position. The player is Baba, which is defined as ""you"", so I can move around as long as I'm not hitting a stop.

The key is to the right, 6 steps away. But there's a wall in the way at 5 steps to the right and 1 step up. Also, there's a door at 5 steps to the right and 1 step up. Wait, the door might be a way to pass through, but the rule says ""door"" isn't mentioned, so maybe it's just a static object. 

Looking at the text blocks, there's a ""key"" rule at 5 steps right, 3 up. An ""is"" at 6 right, 3 up, and ""win"" at 7 right, 3 up. If I can rearrange those to make ""baba is win"", that would let me win by reaching Baba. But how to move the text blocks?

I need to move the ""key is win"" rule so that it becomes ""baba is win"". To do that, I have to move the ""is"" and ""win"" text blocks next to ""baba"". The ""baba"" rule is at 3 left, 3 steps down from the current position. Let me see the positions again.

The current ""baba"" rule is 3 steps to the left and 3 steps down from where I am. So to get there, I need to move left three times and down three times. But there are walls in the way. Let me check the map again.

Looking at the walls, at 2 steps right and 3 up there's a wall. Then moving down, at 2 right and 3 down there's another wall. So maybe there's a path around. Alternatively, maybe I can use the existing rules to change things.

Alternatively, since the key is win, maybe I can just go grab the key. But the path is blocked by walls. The key is at 6 steps right. Let me see the path from my current position. If I move right, then up or down might be possible. But there's a wall at 2 right, 2 step up. So maybe move up first to avoid the wall.

Wait, the player's current position isn't explicitly listed, but the rules and objects are positioned relative to somewhere. Assuming I'm at the starting point, maybe near the bottom left. Let me try to visualize the grid.

Alternatively, focus on manipulating the rules. The key is win, so if I can change that to baba is win, then touching baba would make me win. To do that, I need to rearrange the text blocks: ""key is win"" into ""baba is win"". The ""key"", ""is"", and ""win"" blocks are all along the top right. The ""baba"" rule is lower down. So I need to move those text blocks.

But to move text blocks, they can't be stop. The current rules are ""wall is stop"", so any object labeled stop can't be moved. Looking at the objects, the walls are stop, but the text blocks like ""key"", ""is"", ""win"", ""door"", ""baba"", ""you"" might not be stop. So maybe I can move them.

So the plan is: move the ""is"" and ""win"" blocks next to ""baba"" to create ""baba is win"". Let's see their positions. The ""baba"" rule is at 3 steps left and 3 steps down. The ""is"" is at 2 steps left and 3 steps down, and ""you"" is at 1 step left and 3 steps down. So if I can move the ""win"" block from 7 right, 3 up to be next to ""baba"", that would work.

But how to get there? The path might be blocked by walls. Let's see. From the current position (assuming near the bottom left), moving right towards the text blocks on the top right. But there are walls at certain positions. Maybe navigate around them by moving up, then right, then down.

Alternatively, since the key is win, maybe just go get the key. But the path is blocked by walls. Let me check the objects again. There's a door at 5 steps right, 1 step up. Maybe the door can be used to pass through? But the active rules don't mention door as anything, so maybe it's just a barrier or open. If it's a door that can be opened, but the rules don't say how, perhaps I need to interact with it by moving next to it.

Alternatively, focus on rule manipulation. Since ""baba is you"", I am Baba. If I can make ""baba is win"", then touching Baba would make me win. To do that, I need to move the ""win"" text block next to ""baba"".

The ""win"" block is at 7 steps right, 3 up. The ""baba"" rule is at 3 steps left, 3 steps down. That's a significant distance. Maybe move horizontally first. Let's see if there's a way to move the ""win"" block down and left.

But to move any object, it can't be stop. The walls are stop, but the text blocks are probably movable unless they're part of a stop rule. Since ""wall is stop"", but the text blocks like ""key"", ""is"", etc., are not walls, so they can be moved.

So the steps could be:

1. Move right to reach the ""key is win"" text blocks.
2. Move the ""is"" block to the left next to ""baba"".
3. Move the ""win"" block to the right next to ""is"" and ""baba"", forming ""baba is win"".

But navigating around the walls to get to those text blocks is tricky. Let's map out the path.

Current position (assuming): let's say I'm at (0,0).

Looking at the objects:

- Wall at 4 right, 3 up.
- rule `key` at 7 right, 3 up.
- rule `is` at 8 right, 3 up.
- rule `win` at 9 right, 3 up.
- rule `wall` at 1 left, 2 up.
- etc.

This seems like a grid where each object's position is relative. To move from my position to the ""baba"" rule at 3 left, 3 down, I need to move left and down, but there are walls in the way. For example, at 2 right, 3 up there's a wall. So moving up from my position would hit that wall. Maybe move right first, then up, then left, etc.

Alternatively, focus on moving the text blocks. The ""win"" block is at 9 right, 3 up. To get it to the ""baba"" location (3 left, 3 down), that's a huge distance. Not practical. Maybe instead, move the ""key is win"" rule to ""baba is win"".

The ""key"" is at 7 right, 3 up. ""is"" at 8 right, 3 up. ""win"" at 9 right, 3 up. So the current rule is ""key is win"". To make it ""baba is win"", need to replace ""key"" with ""baba"". The ""baba"" rule is at 3 left, 3 down. So I need to move the ""baba"" text block to the left of the ""is"" and ""win"" blocks.

But moving the ""baba"" block from 3 left, 3 down to 8 right, 3 up (the position of the current ""key"") would require moving it a long way, passing through walls. Not feasible.

Alternatively, maybe take the ""win"" block and move it next to the existing ""baba is you"" rule. The ""baba"" rule is at 3 left, 3 down. The ""is"" is at 2 left, 3 down. The ""you"" is at 1 left, 3 down. So if I can move the ""win"" block to the right of ""baba"", forming ""baba is win"".

The ""win"" block is at 9 right, 3 up. To get it to 3 left, 3 down, that's a massive move. Probably impossible in one go. So maybe another approach.

Wait, perhaps the door at 5 right, 1 up is a way to access the key. If I can move through the door, but since door isn't defined as stop, maybe I can. So path could be right, right, right, up, but there's a wall at 4 right, 3 up. Hmm.

Alternatively, move up to avoid the wall. Let's say I move up once, then right, then down, etc. But need to navigate carefully.

Alternatively, focus on the fact that the key is win. So if I can reach the key, I win. So maybe the solution is to move right past the walls.

Looking at the objects:

From my position, to get to the key at 6 steps right, there's a wall at 4 right, 3 up. But maybe moving down from there?

Wait, the key is at 6 steps right. Let's see the path:

- Start at position (0,0).
- Move right to (1,0).
- Right to (2,0).
- Right to (3,0). But there's a wall at 2 steps right and 3 down? Wait, no, the walls are at various positions. Let me check again.

Looking at the wall positions:

- wall 4 steps to the right and 4 step up: (4,4)
- wall 1 step left and 3 step up: (-1,3)
- wall 4 right and 3 up: (4,3)
- wall 4 right and 2 up: (4,2)
- wall 4 right and 1 up: (4,1)
- wall 4 right: (4,0)
- wall 4 right and 1 down: (4,-1)
- etc.

So the walls are forming a barrier on the right side, starting from (4,4) down to (4,-1). On the left, there's a wall at (-1,3).

So the map is bounded by walls on the right and a bit on the left. The key is at (6,0), I think. Because the key is 6 steps to the right, which would be (6,0). But there's a wall at (4,0), so how to get past that?

If I can move around the wall at (4,0). Maybe go up, then right, then down.

For example:

1. Move up from (0,0) to (0,1).
2. Right to (1,1).
3. Right to (2,1).
4. Right to (3,1).
5. Up to (3,2).
6. Right to (4,2) — but there's a wall at (4,2), so can't move there.
Alternative path:

1. Move up to (0,1).
2. Right to (1,1).
3. Right to (2,1).
4. Right to (3,1).
5. Up to (3,2).
6. Right to (4,2) — blocked.
7. Maybe instead, from (3,1), move up to (3,2), then right is blocked. Then move down to (3,1), then right to (4,1) — but (4,1) is a wall. Hmm.

This is tricky. Maybe another approach. What if I change the rule so that ""wall is not stop""? But to do that, I need to rewrite the existing ""wall is stop"" rule. But the text blocks are spread out. The ""wall is stop"" rule is at 1 left, 2 up. To delete that rule, I would need to move or remove it, but I can only move objects that aren't stop. Since ""wall"" is stop, but the text blocks themselves might not be. So maybe I can move the ""wall"" rule to somewhere else.

For example, take the ""wall is stop"" rule at (-1,2) and move it. If I can move the ""wall"" text block away, then perhaps walls aren't stop anymore. But how?

Alternatively, create a new rule ""wall is not stop"" by moving the existing ""stop"" property. The ""stop"" rule is at 1 right, 2 up. If I can move ""stop"" to a different position, but ""wall is stop"" is a rule made of three text blocks: ""wall"", ""is"", ""stop"". To change the rule, I need to rearrange these.

So the current rule is ""wall is stop"" — ""wall"" at (-1,2), ""is"" at (0,2), ""stop"" at (1,2). To change it to ""wall is not stop"", I would need to replace ""stop"" with ""not stop"", but ""not"" isn't a defined property here. Alternatively, create a new rule ""wall is not"" by moving the blocks, but that might not work.

This seems complicated. Maybe sticking to the original goal: key is win. So just grab the key. To do that, path through the walls. Let's see if there's a way around.

From (0,0), move up to (0,1), right to (1,1), right to (2,1). At (2,1), there's a wall at (4,1), but maybe move up to (2,2). Is there a wall at (2,2)? Looking at the objects, there's a wall at (2,2) — yes, wall 2 steps right and 2 step up: (2,2). So can't go there.

Alternative route: From (2,1), move down to (2,0). Then right to (3,0). But (4,0) is a wall, so can't go further right. Maybe up again.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe the intended solution is to rearrange the rules. Since the key is win, but we need to be Baba to win. So change the rule to ""baba is win"".

The ""baba"" rule is at 3 left, 3 down from where I am. Let's say my current position is (0,0), then ""baba"" is at (-3, -3). The ""is"" block is at (-2, -3), and ""you"" at (-1, -3). To create ""baba is win"", I need to get the ""win"" block next to them.

The ""win"" block is at (9,3). So I need to move it from (9,3) to (-3, -3). That's a huge move. Not feasible. Alternatively, find a shorter path.

Wait, maybe the ""win"" block is at 7 steps right, 3 up in the initial observation, but in later steps, it moved. Let me check the latest observation.

In the last observation before this one, the ""win"" block is at 7 steps right, 3 up. So (7,3). To get to (-3,-3), need to move left 10 and down 6. Impossible in one move.

Alternative idea: Use the fact that the key is win. So if I can reach the key, touching it would make me win. So perhaps the path is to move right, avoiding walls.

From (0,0):

1. Move right to (1,0).
2. Right to (2,0).
3. Up to (2,1).
4. Right to (3,1).
5. Up to (3,2).
6. Right to (4,2) — blocked by wall.
7. Instead, from (3,2), move up to (3,3).
8. Right to (4,3) — blocked by wall.
9. Move down to (3,2), then right to (4,2) — still blocked.
Hmm, stuck.

Alternative route:

From (0,0):

1. Move up to (0,1).
2. Right to (1,1).
3. Right to (2,1).
4. Up to (2,2) — blocked by wall.
5. Move down to (2,1), then right to (3,1).
6. Up to (3,2).
7. Right to (4,2) — blocked.
This isn't working.

Maybe the answer is to move the ""win"" block next to ""baba"" by moving it horizontally. The ""win"" block is at (7,3). If I can move it left, maybe pass through the door at (5,1).

From (7,3) move left to (6,3), (5,3), (4,3) — but (4,3) is a wall. So can't. Alternatively, move down from (7,3) to (7,2), then left to (6,2), (5,2), (4,2) — wall. No good.

This is really challenging. Maybe the intended solution is to realize that by default, ""baba is you"", so if I can make ""baba is win"", then touching Baba would make me win. To do that, rearrange the text blocks.

The ""baba"" rule is at (-3,-3), ""is"" at (-2,-3), ""you"" at (-1,-3). Need to add ""win"" next to ""baba"". So move the ""win"" block from (7,3) to (-3,-3). But that's too far. Alternatively, find a shorter path by moving the blocks step by step.

Alternatively, take the ""is"" and ""win"" blocks from the top and place them next to ""baba"". For example:

1. Move the ""win"" block from (7,3) down to (7,2), (7,1), (7,0).
2. Then move left to (6,0), (5,0), etc., but there's a wall at (4,0).
3. This approach isn't working.

Another idea: Use the door at (5,1). If I can move through the door, but since door isn't stop, maybe I can. So path could be:

From (0,0) -> right to (5,0) is blocked by wall at (4,0). Instead, move up to (0,1), right to (1,1), right to (2,1), up to (","

Let me try to figure out what to do here. The active rules are key is win, wall is stop, and baba is you. The goal is usually to reach the win object, which is the key right now.

Looking at the objects on the map, the key is 6 steps to the right. But wait, how do I get there? There are walls all over the place. The walls are defined as stop, which means I can't move through them. But since I'm Baba and baba is you, maybe I can move the rules to change something. 

The key is win, so if I can get to the key, I win. But the path is blocked by walls. Let me check the positions. The key is at 6 steps to the right. The current position of Baba is probably at the starting point, maybe at 0 steps right or something. To get to the key, I need to move right multiple times, but there's a wall at 2 steps right and 3 steps up, then another wall at 2 steps right and 2 steps up, etc. So moving directly right might hit walls. 

Alternatively, maybe I can manipulate the rules. There are text blocks for key, is, win, wall, stop, door, baba, etc. If I can rearrange these to change the properties. For example, if I can make stop not a stop, then I could move through walls. Or maybe change baba to stop so that I can't move, which isn't helpful. 

Wait, the rules are key is win, wall is stop, and baba is you. If I can create a new rule that overrides wall is stop, like making wall is something else. But how? To do that, I need to move the text blocks. The rule 'wall' is at 3 steps left and 2 steps up, 'is' is there, and 'stop' is at 1 step left and 2 steps up. So if I can move the 'stop' text block away or replace it. 

But to move a text block, I have to be adjacent to it and it's not defined as stop. Wait, the current rules say wall is stop, but the text blocks for rules are probably not walls. So maybe the text blocks are movable. Let me check the objects. There are rule `key`, rule `is`, rule `win`, rule `wall`, rule `stop`, etc. These are separate objects. So I can move these rules. 

For instance, the rule 'wall is stop' is made by the text block 'wall' at 3 step left and 2 step up, 'is' at 2 step left and 2 step up, and 'stop' at 1 step left and 2 step up. If I can break this rule by moving one of these pieces, then wall would no longer be stop. But how to do that? 

If I move the 'stop' text block, then the rule 'wall is stop' would be broken. The 'stop' is at 1 step left and 2 step up. To move it, I need to be adjacent to it. Where is Baba located? The rule 'baba' is at 3 step left and 3 steps down. So Baba is at 3 left and 3 down. To reach the 'stop' text block at 1 left and 2 up, I need to move right twice and up once. But the path might be blocked. Let's see.

From Baba's position (3 left, 3 down), moving right once would be to 2 left, 3 down. Then right again to 1 left, 3 down. Then up once to 1 left, 2 down. But there's a wall at 2 steps right and 3 step up, but wait, that's a different position. Maybe the walls are arranged in a grid. This is getting a bit confusing. 

Alternatively, maybe instead of moving the 'stop' rule, I can create a new rule that makes the key not a win. But the goal is to reach the key, so that's not helpful. Or maybe make Baba a win. If I can make 'baba is win', then reaching Baba would win. But how? 

The current active rules are key is win, wall is stop, baba is you. If I can create a rule 'baba is win', then since baba is you, that would mean you (Baba) are the win condition. So if I can place that rule somewhere on the map. 

To create a new rule, I need the text blocks 'baba', 'is', and 'win'. The 'baba' text block is at 3 step left and 3 steps down. The 'is' is at 2 step left and 3 steps down. The 'win' is at 7 steps right and 3 step up. So I need to move these together. 

But moving them requires being adjacent. Let's see. From Baba's position at 3 left, 3 down, moving right to 2 left, 3 down. Then right to 1 left, 3 down. Then up to 1 left, 2 down. But there's a wall at 2 steps right and 3 step up? Not sure. Maybe the walls are in specific positions. 

Alternatively, maybe moving the 'win' rule to be next to 'baba' and 'is'. The 'win' is at 7 right, 3 up. That's quite far. Maybe there's a better way. 

Wait, the key is 6 steps to the right. If I can move the key to be where Baba is, but the key is an object defined as win. Not sure. 

Another idea: Since key is win, maybe grabbing the key (if that's possible) makes me win. But how do you grab objects in Baba Is You? You push them, I think. So if I can push the key towards me. But the key is 6 steps right. If I move right multiple times, but there are walls blocking the path. 

Looking at the objects again: wall 2 steps right and 3 up, rule key at 5 right, 3 up, etc. The path from Baba's position (assuming he's at the lower left) to the key is blocked by walls. Maybe I need to rearrange the rules to remove the stop property from walls. 

To do that, I need to break the 'wall is stop' rule. The components are at 3 left, 2 up (wall), 2 left, 2 up (is), and 1 left, 2 up (stop). To break this, I need to move one of these pieces. 

Baba is at 3 left, 3 down. To reach the 'stop' piece at 1 left, 2 up, he needs to move right twice, up once. Let's see the path:

From 3 left, 3 down:
- Move right to 2 left, 3 down.
- Move right to 1 left, 3 down.
- Move up to 1 left, 2 down.
- Move up to 1 left, 1 down.
- Move up to 1 left, 0 down (which is 2 up from original position).

But along the way, are there walls blocking? The wall at 2 steps right and 3 step up is probably not in the way here. Wait, the walls are at specific positions. For example, wall 4 steps to the right and 3 step up — that's a different location. Maybe the path is clear. 

Assuming the path is clear, moving to the 'stop' text block and then moving it away would break the 'wall is stop' rule. Once that's done, walls are no longer stop, so I can walk through them. Then I can go around the walls to get to the key. 

Alternatively, once walls are not stop, I can push the key past the walls. 

But how to move the 'stop' text block. Once I'm adjacent to it, I can move it. So the plan is:

1. Move from Baba's position (3 left, 3 down) to the 'stop' text block at (1 left, 2 up).
2. Move the 'stop' text block to a different location, breaking the 'wall is stop' rule.
3. Now walls are not stop, so I can move through them.
4. Navigate to the key, which is 6 steps to the right, and grab it, since key is win.

But let's check the exact positions. The 'stop' is at 1 step left and 2 step up from what? The observation lists the objects with their positions relative to the player, I think. For example, ""wall 4 steps to the right and 4 step up"" means there's a wall at position (4 right, 4 up) from the player's current location. 

Wait, the observation says ""Objects on the map"" with positions like ""wall 4 steps to the right and 4 step up"". So the player's current position is the reference point (0,0). So all other objects are positioned relative to the player. 

So the player (Baba) is at (0,0). The 'stop' rule is at (-1, -2) because it's 1 step left and 2 steps down. Wait, the observation says ""1 step to the left and 2 step up"" — no, wait, the description says ""rule `stop` 1 step to the left and 2 step up"". So from the player's position, that's (-1, +2). 

Baba's position is at (0,0). The 'stop' text block is at (-1, 2). To move there, the player needs to move left once and up twice. 

But can the player move left? The active rules are wall is stop, but the player is Baba, who is you. Unless there's a wall in the way. Let's check for walls around the player. 

Looking at the objects: there's a wall at 4 steps right and 4 up, which is far away. The walls closer are at 2 steps right and 3 up, etc. So from (0,0), moving left to (-1,0) — is there a wall there? The observation doesn't list a wall at (-1,0), so probably it's clear. 

So the path to the 'stop' text block at (-1,2) would be:

1. Move left to (-1, 0).
2. Move up to (-1, 1).
3. Move up to (-1, 2) — where the 'stop' rule is.

Once there, the player can move the 'stop' text block. To move it, the player needs to be adjacent and the text block not be stop. Since 'stop' is part of the 'wall is stop' rule, but once we move it, it's no longer part of that rule. So moving the 'stop' block should be allowed. 

After moving 'stop' away, the 'wall is stop' rule is broken, so walls are no longer stop. Then the player can move through walls. 

Once that's done, the player can go towards the key at (6,0) (since the key is 6 steps to the right). But there are walls along the way, but since walls are no longer stop, the player can walk through them. 

So the steps would be:

- Move left to (-1,0)
- Move up to (-1,1)
- Move up to (-1,2) to reach 'stop' rule
- Move 'stop' rule, say, to the right to (-1,3)
- Now walls are not stop
- Move right to (0,0) → (1,0), (2,0), etc., towards the key at (6,0)
- Pass through walls since they're not stop anymore
- Reach key at (6,0) and win

But how to move the 'stop' rule. Once the player is at (-1,2), they can take the 'stop' text block and move it. The direction depends on where to move it. For example, move it right to (-1,3), which is a valid position. 

So the action sequence would be:

1. left (to (-1,0))
2. up (to (-1,1))
3. up (to (-1,2))
4. take the 'stop' text block and move it right, say, to (-1,3)
5. then move right multiple times to reach the key.

But the problem is that each action must be a single step. The user is asking for the next action based on the current observation. The current observation shows that the previous actions failed because the output wasn't a valid action. The last observation before this was when the assistant tried 'right' and it failed. Now, the current observation is after several steps, and the active rules are still the same. 

In the latest observation, the player's position isn't explicitly stated, but the objects are relative. The key is at 6 steps to the right. The 'stop' rule is at 1 step left and 2 step up. So the player is likely at a position where they can move towards the 'stop' rule. 

Given that, the immediate action should be to move towards the 'stop' rule to break the 'wall is stop' rule. So from the player's current position, which is unknown, but based on the objects listed, the 'stop' rule is at (-1, 2). So the player needs to move left once and up twice. 

But the player might be at a different position. Wait, the rule `baba` is at 1 step to the left and 2 steps down. So Baba's text block is at (-1, -2). That means the player (Baba) is at position (1, 2) relative to that text block. Wait, this is getting confusing. 

Alternatively, maybe the player's position is at (0,0), and the objects are listed relative to that. The 'baba' text block is at 1 step left and 2 steps down, which would be (-1, -2). So the player is at (0,0), and the 'baba' rule is at (-1, -2). That means the actual position of Baba (the character) is separate from the text block. 

This is getting too complicated. Maybe the best immediate action is to move right towards the key, but considering the walls. Alternatively, move towards the 'stop' rule to break the wall rule. 

Given the previous failures, perhaps the correct action now is to move in a direction that allows reaching the 'stop' rule. For example, if the player is to the right of the 'stop' rule, they need to move left. 

In the latest observation, the key is 6 steps to the right, and the 'stop' rule is 1 step left and 2 step up. So from the player's position (0,0), moving left once and up twice gets to the 'stop' rule. So the action would be left then up twice. But since each action is a single step, the first action should be left. 

But the previous attempts to go right led to defaulting to idle, possibly because the path was blocked. So the correct action now is to move left to approach the 'stop' rule.

Let's try to figure out what to do here. The active rules are ""key is win"", ""wall is stop"", and ""baba is you"". So right now, the key is considered the win condition, which means I need to get to the key to win, or maybe the current definition is that touching the key makes me win. However, the key's position is 8 steps to the right and 3 steps up from the wall. Looking at the objects on the map, the key is located at 7 steps to the right and 3 steps up, which aligns with the ""key is win"" rule.

But wait, in the latest observation, the key is at 8 steps to the right and 3 steps up. Let me check again. The objects list: ""key 8 steps to the right and 3 step up"". Right. So the key is positioned such that to reach it, I need to move right and up. However, there are walls blocking the path. For example, there's a wall 4 steps to the right and 4 steps up, but in the current observation, the walls are at varying positions. Let me parse the objects again carefully.

The active rules mean that walls are stop, so I can't move through them. Also, since ""baba is you"", I am Baba, so I can move unless stopped by a wall. The goal is usually to reach the win object, which is currently the key. So the objective is to reach the key at 8 steps right and 3 steps up.

Looking at the current positions:

- The key is at 8 right, 3 up.
- There's a rule `key` at 7 right, 3 up, followed by `is` and `win`, which form the ""key is win"" rule. That part is still intact.

But how do I get to the key? The path might be blocked by walls. Let's check the surrounding objects. To the right of Baba (assuming Baba is at a certain position, but the observation doesn't explicitly state Baba's location. Wait, the objects listed include ""rule `baba` 1 step to the left and 2 steps down"" and other rules. Wait, in the current observation, the rule `baba` is 2 steps to the left and 3 steps down from somewhere. Wait, the exact position of Baba (the entity) isn't directly listed. Hmm, maybe I need to infer Baba's position based on the rules. The rule `baba` is an object, so perhaps Baba is at the position of that rule block. Let me check:

In the current observation's objects:

- rule `baba` is 2 step to the left and 3 steps down.

But relative to where? The observation lists objects with their positions relative to the player, I think. For example, ""wall 4 steps to the right and 4 step up"" would mean that there's a wall 4 steps to the right and 4 steps up from the player's current position. So the player is somewhere, and all other objects are positioned relative to that.

Assuming that, the rule `baba` is located 2 steps to the left and 3 steps down from the player. So if the player is at position (0,0), then the `baba` rule is at (-2, -3). But how does this help? Maybe the player is at a position where they can move towards the key.

The key is at 8 right, 3 up. So from the player's current position, moving right 8 and up 3 would get to the key. But the path might be blocked by walls. Let's look at the walls:

- wall 3 steps to the right and 3 step up
- wall 2 steps to the right and 2 step up
- wall 2 steps to the right and 1 step up
- wall 3 steps to the right and 1 step down
- etc.

Wait, the walls are positioned at various points. For example, there's a wall 3 steps right and 3 up, which is directly in the path towards the key. Also, there's a wall at 2 right and 2 up, which might block movement. Additionally, the ""stop"" rule is active, so any wall is immovable.

So the player needs to navigate around these walls to reach the key. But how?

The key is at 8 right, 3 up. Let's see the path:

From player's position (assuming they are at the starting point, maybe where the `baba` rule is?), but the exact position is unclear. Alternatively, perhaps the player is at the position of the `you` rule, but since the rule `you` is part of ""baba is you"", perhaps the player is at the position of the `baba` rule.

Wait, the active rules include ""baba is you"", meaning that the player is Baba. So Baba's position is where the `baba` rule is located. Looking at the current observation:

rule `baba` 2 step to the left and 3 steps down.

So if the player is at the position of the `baba` rule block, which is 2 steps left and 3 steps down from their current location? That's a bit confusing. Maybe the player's position is inferred from the objects. Alternatively, perhaps the player is at a default position, and all other objects are relative to that.

This is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to visualize the map.

Assuming the player is at (0,0):

- The key is at (8,3).
- There's a wall at (3,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1 down), etc.
- The `baba` rule is at (-2, -3), meaning the player (Baba) is at (-2, -3)?
Wait, no. If the rule `baba` is 2 steps to the left and 3 steps down from the player's position, then the player's position is relative to that rule. This is getting a bit tangled. Maybe it's better to focus on the movement required to reach the key, avoiding walls.

The key is at 8 right, 3 up. The player needs to move right and up. But the wall at 3 right and 3 up is directly in the path. So moving directly right 8 and up 3 is blocked. Therefore, the player needs to find an alternative path.

Looking at the walls:

- There's a wall at 3 right, 3 up (directly in the way).
- Another wall at 2 right, 2 up. So moving up from there would hit the wall at 3,3 up.
- There's a wall at 2 right, 1 up. Maybe moving down past that?

Alternatively, perhaps the player can move around the walls by going left or right first. For example, moving right past the wall at 3 right, 3 up. But how?

Wait, the key is at 8 right, 3 up. The wall at 3 right, 3 up is blocking the direct path. So the player needs to maneuver around this wall. Maybe by moving up before moving right, but the wall at 2 right, 2 up might block that.

Alternatively, perhaps the player can move right past the wall at 3 right, 3 up by moving around it. But since walls are stop, the player can't move through them. So the player needs to find a way to go around them.

Another approach: Since the key is defined as the win condition, maybe the player can change the rules to make themselves the win condition instead. For example, moving the ""win"" text block next to Baba to make ""baba is win"". But that would require manipulating the text blocks.

Looking at the current objects:

The ""key is win"" rule is composed of the text blocks at 7 right, 3 up (key), 8 right, 3 up (is), and 9 right, 3 up (win). So to change the win condition to Baba, the player would need to move the ""win"" text block next to Baba's rule.

Baba's rule is at 2 step left and 3 steps down from somewhere. Wait, in the current observation, the rule `baba` is located at 2 step to the left and 3 steps down. Assuming the player is at the position relative to this rule, perhaps moving the ""win"" block to be next to the ""baba"" rule would create a new rule ""baba is win"", making Baba the win condition.

So the steps would be:

1. Move towards the ""win"" text block at 9 right, 3 up.
2. Navigate around walls to reach that position.
3. Once there, move the ""win"" block next to the ""baba"" rule.

But navigating there might be blocked. Let's check the path to the ""win"" block.

The ""win"" block is at 9 right, 3 up. The key is at 8 right, 3 up. So between the key and the win block is the key itself. To get to the win block, the player would have to pass through the key's position, which is allowed since the key is the win condition. Wait, no. The key is an object, but since ""key is win"", touching it would make the player win. So perhaps the player can move right to reach the key, then right again to get to the win block.

But between the player's current position and the key, there are walls. For instance, the wall at 3 right, 3 up is directly in the path if the player is trying to go right and up. Let's assume the player is at the position of the ""baba"" rule, which is 2 left and 3 down from somewhere. This is getting confusing without a clear map.

Alternatively, maybe the player should focus on moving the ""win"" text block next to themselves. To do that, they need to move the ""win"" block from 9 right, 3 up to be adjacent to their current position.

But how to move the ""win"" block? The player can move objects that are not ""stop"". The ""stop"" rule is currently defined as ""wall is stop"", so walls cannot be moved. Other objects, like text blocks (key, is, win, door, etc.), can be moved unless they are part of a ""stop"" rule. Since the ""stop"" rule only affects walls, the text blocks can be moved.

So the plan is:

1. Move the ""win"" text block next to the ""baba"" rule to create ""baba is win"".
2. This would make Baba the win condition, so the player can win just by staying in place.

To do this, the player needs to navigate to the ""win"" block at 9 right, 3 up, move it left to 8 right, 3 up (next to the ""key"" block), then left again to 7 right, 3 up (next to the ""baba"" rule at 6 right, 3 up? Wait, the ""baba"" rule is at 2 left and 3 down, which is confusing.

Wait, in the current observation, the rule `baba` is located at 2 step to the left and 3 steps down. Assuming the player is at the position relative to this rule, perhaps the player is at (2 right, 3 up) from the `baba` rule's position. This is getting too ambiguous without a coordinate system.

Alternatively, let's look at the positions of the rules:

- The ""key is win"" rule is at 7 right, 3 up (key), 8 right, 3 up (is), 9 right, 3 up (win).
- The ""baba is you"" rule is at 1 left and 2 down (rule `baba` is 1 left, 2 down; rule `is` is same position; rule `you` is 1 right, 2 down).

Wait, in the current observation, the rule `baba` is 1 step to the left and 2 steps down, and the `is` and `you` rules are adjacent. So the ""baba is you"" rule is formed by those blocks.

To create a ""baba is win"" rule, the player needs to move the ""win"" block from 9 right, 3 up to be adjacent to the ""baba"" block.

So the path would be:

1. Move right to reach the ""win"" block at 9 right, 3 up.
2. Move left to bring the ""win"" block next to the ""baba"" block.

But there are walls blocking the path. For example, the wall at 3 right, 3 up is in the way. So the player needs to find a way around.

Alternatively, maybe the player can move down and then right to bypass the walls. Let's see:

From the player's position (assuming they are at the ""baba"" rule's location), which is 2 left and 3 down from somewhere. If they move down, they might avoid the walls. But this is speculative.

Another approach: Since the key is the win condition, perhaps the player can simply move to the key's location. The key is at 8 right, 3 up. To get there, the player needs to move right 8 and up 3, but the wall at 3 right, 3 up blocks that path. So they need to go around.

Maybe moving right past the wall at 3 right, 3 up by going around it to the right or left. For example, move right to 4, then up to bypass the wall. But there's a wall at 4 right, 4 up, which might block that.

Alternatively, move up first to 3 up, then right past the wall at 3 right, 3 up. But the wall at 3 right, 3 up is there, so moving right into it would be stopped.

This is tricky. Maybe the solution is to change the rules to make Baba the win condition instead of the key. That way, the player doesn't need to reach the key.

To do that, the player needs to move the ""win"" text block next to the ""baba"" rule. The ""baba"" rule is at 1 left and 2 down, and the ""win"" block is at 9 right, 3 up. The distance between them is quite large, but maybe there's a path.

The player would need to navigate from their current position to the ""win"" block, moving through the grid while avoiding walls. Let's outline the steps:

1. Move right towards the ""key is win"" rule.
2. Avoid walls by moving in a direction that doesn't hit the stop blocks.
3. Once the ""win"" block is reached, move it left to be adjacent to the ""baba"" rule.

But given the numerous walls, this might require a detour. For example:

- Start by moving right from the player's position (assuming they are at the ""baba"" rule's location).
- Move right until blocked by a wall, then up or down to find a path.
- Repeatedly adjusting direction to reach the ""win"" block.

However, the exact path needs to be calculated. Given the time constraints, perhaps the immediate action is to move right towards the ""key"" block, as it's part of the ""key is win"" rule and moving it might help in redefining the win condition.

Alternatively, since the key is already the win condition, maybe the player can simply move to the key's location. The key is at 8 right, 3 up. To get there, the player would need to move right 8 and up 3, but obstacles are in the way. Let's see:

From the player's position (assuming they are at the start), moving right 8 would pass through walls at 3, 4, etc. Up 3 would also hit walls.

Alternatively, maybe the player can move down, then right, then up. For example:

1. Move down to avoid walls.
2. Move right past the walls.
3. Move up to reach the key.

But without knowing the exact starting position, this is challenging.

Another possibility: The ""door"" rule is at 6 right, 1 up. Maybe using the door to pass through, but doors are not mentioned as stop, so if the door is a movable object, perhaps the player can use it to reach the key. But the active rules don't mention door properties, so it's treated as a regular object unless defined otherwise.

Given the time I've spent and the need to provide an action, I'll go with moving right towards the key, as that's the win condition, and maybe the path will clear or there's a way around.

51,Failed to obtain a valid action from the reasoning.,"<reasoning>
I need to figure out the correct action to take in this Baba Is You game based on the current observation. Let me start by understanding the situation.

The active rules right now are:
- key is win
- wall is stop
- baba is you

So, the key is considered the win object, walls are stoppable, and Baba is the player. My goal is to reach the key because it's set as win. But looking at the map, there's a key located at 6 steps to the right. However, the path might be blocked by walls or other obstacles. Let me check the objects around me.

The objects listed are positions relative to Baba's current location. Let me parse the objects again:

- Wall is 2 steps to the right and 3 steps up.
- Rule 'key' is at 5 steps right, 3 up.
- Rule 'is' at 6 right, 3 up.
- Rule 'win' at 7 right, 3 up.
- There's a rule 'wall' 3 steps left and 2 up, then another 'is' 2 left and 2 up, and 'stop' 1 left and 2 up.
- Walls at various positions, like 2 right, 2 up; ball at 3 right, 2 up; more walls down lower steps.

Baba's position is at the location where the 'baba' rule is, which is 3 steps left and 3 steps down from the current viewpoint. So, to move right towards the key, I need to check if the path is blocked.

The key is 6 steps to the right. Let's see the obstacles between here and there. Looking at the objects:

- At 5 steps right, 3 up is the 'key' rule. Then moving right further, there's a 'win' rule at 7 right, 3 up. But the key is the target.

Wait, maybe the key is to the right, but there's a wall blocking the path. Let me check. The walls are at 2 steps right, 3 up; then further down at 2 right, 2 up; 2 right, 1 up; and so on. The key is at 6 right, so between Baba's position (3 left, 3 down) and the key, moving right would require moving past several steps. But the wall at 2 steps right might be near the starting point.

Wait, perhaps the grid is laid out such that moving right increases the x-coordinate. So if Baba is at, say, position (0,0), then right would be (1,0), (2,0), etc. The key is at (6,3) perhaps? But the observation mentions objects relative to Baba's position.

But maybe it's better to focus on the immediate surrounding. Let's see:

The key is 5 steps to the right and 3 steps up. But the rules for 'key', 'is', 'win' are all in that direction. The current active rule 'key is win' means that picking up the key makes you win. So the goal is to reach the key.

But to get there, I need to move right and up. However, there's a wall at 2 steps right and 3 steps up. That wall is defined as 'stop', so I can't move through it unless I change the rules. Since Baba is 'you', I can move unless there's a 'stop' property. But the wall is 'stop', so I can't push or move it unless I alter the 'wall is stop' rule.

Alternatively, maybe I can rearrange the text blocks to change the rules. For example, if I can move the 'is' or 'stop' rules to make walls not stop, then I could go through them. But to do that, I need to move the text blocks that make up the rules.

Looking at the objects, the 'wall is stop' rule is made up of the 'wall' text block 3 steps left and 2 steps up, 'is' 2 steps left and 2 steps up, and 'stop' 1 step left and 2 steps up. So those three blocks form the 'wall is stop' rule. If I can move any of these, I can change the rule.

Baba is at 3 steps left and 3 steps down. So to reach the 'wall' text block that's part of the 'wall is stop' rule, I need to move left and up. But moving left might not be safe if there are other walls. Alternatively, maybe I can move the 'is' or 'stop' parts to break the rule.

Alternatively, the 'key is win' rule is at 5,3 up. If I can grab that 'key' text block and move it somewhere else, but since the key is an object, not a rule, maybe I need to pick it up. Wait, in Baba Is You, you can push text blocks but not necessarily pick up objects like the key. The key is an object that you can move onto, and if the rule says key is win, touching it wins.

But in this case, the key is at 6 steps to the right. So maybe moving right towards it. But the path might be blocked. Let's see the objects in the way:

From Baba's position, moving right: the first obstacle is a wall at 2 steps right. Then at 5 steps right, 3 up is the 'key' rule. Wait, perhaps the grid is such that moving right increases the x-coordinate, and up increases the y-coordinate. So the key is to the right and up from Baba's current position.

But the wall at 2 steps right is directly to the right. So moving right once would hit that wall. Since walls are 'stop', I can't move through them. So I need to find another way around.

Looking at the other objects: there's a ball at 3 steps right, 2 steps up. Maybe that's a movable object? But the active rules don't mention the ball having any properties. Unless I can create a new rule. For example, if I can make the ball a stop or a win, but that requires manipulating text blocks.

The key is at 5 right, 3 up. The 'key' rule is there, along with 'is' and 'win' to form the 'key is win' rule. To reach the key, I need to get past the wall at 2 steps right. Maybe I can move the 'is' or 'stop' parts of the 'wall is stop' rule to remove the stop property from walls.

The 'wall is stop' rule is composed of three text blocks: 'wall' 3 left, 2 up; 'is' 2 left, 2 up; 'stop' 1 left, 2 up. If I can move any of these, I can break the rule. For example, moving the 'stop' text block away would make walls not stop.

Baba's current position is where the 'baba' rule is, which is 3 left and 3 down. To reach the 'stop' text block (1 left, 2 up), I need to move left and up. Let's see:

From Baba's position (assuming it's at 0,0), moving left 1 step and up 2 steps would reach the 'stop' text block. But is that possible? Let's check the obstacles. The path would be:

- Move left 1 step: is there a wall? At 2 steps right and 3 up, there's a wall, but that's to the right of Baba, not in the left direction. The wall at 2 steps right and 3 up is in the opposite direction. So moving left from Baba's position (which is 3 left and 3 down) would be towards negative coordinates. Wait, perhaps the coordinate system is relative. This is getting a bit confusing.

Alternatively, let's think in terms of the grid layout. Suppose Baba is at position (0,0). The objects are positioned relative to him:

- Wall is at (2,3) (right 2, up 3)
- Rule 'key' is at (5,3)
- 'is' at (6,3)
- 'win' at (7,3)
- The 'wall is stop' rule components are at (-3,2) (wall), (-2,2) (is), (-1,2) (stop)
- Other walls at (2,2), (2,1), etc.

So to reach the 'stop' text block at (-1,2), I need to move left (decreasing x) and up (increasing y). From (0,0) to (-1,2), that's left 1 and up 2. But the path might be blocked. Looking at the surrounding objects:

- Moving left from (0,0) to (-1,0): is there a wall? The 'wall is stop' rule has a 'wall' block at (-3,2), which is far left. There's no wall immediately to the left of Baba. So maybe moving left is possible.

But the active rule 'wall is stop' means that any object named 'wall' has the 'stop' property. So if there's a wall nearby, I can't pass through it. The wall at (2,3) is to the right and up, not in the left direction. So moving left should be possible unless there's another wall.

Assuming there's no wall to the left, moving left 1 and up 2 steps would reach the 'stop' text block. Then, by moving that block, I can break the 'wall is stop' rule, making walls not stop. Once that's done, I could move through the wall at (2,3) and reach the key.

Alternatively, maybe there's a quicker way. If I can change the 'key is win' rule to make something else the win condition, but that's not necessary right now. The goal is still to get the key because it's the win object.

Another approach: Since the key is at (5,3), and I'm at (0,0), the direct path is right 5 and up 3. But there's a wall at (2,3). If I can make that wall not stop, I can go around it. To do that, I need to break the 'wall is stop' rule.

To break the rule, I need to move at least one of the three text blocks that make it up: 'wall' at (-3,2), 'is' at (-2,2), 'stop' at (-1,2). Let's focus on the 'stop' block at (-1,2). If I can move that block, the rule would break.

To move the 'stop' block, I need to be adjacent to it and pull or push it. Since Baba is 'you', I can move adjacent objects unless they are 'stop'. The 'stop' block itself is part of the rule, but is it considered an object or a text block? In Baba Is You, text blocks are objects that can be moved if they aren't stopped.

Wait, the 'stop' text block is part of the rule 'wall is stop', but as a text block, it's an object. Since the rule 'wall is stop' makes walls stop, but does it affect the text blocks? Probably not. Text blocks can be moved unless they are part of a rule that makes them stop. However, in this case, the 'stop' text block is not part of a 'stop' rule for itself. So maybe I can move it.

So, moving from (0,0) to (-1,2) would require moving left 1 and up 2. Let's see if that's possible. The path would be:

- From (0,0) move up 1 to (0,1). Is there a wall there? Looking at the objects, at (2,1) there's a wall, but that's to the right and down from Baba. So (0,1) is clear.
- Then move up another to (0,2). Is there a wall? The 'is' block is at (-2,2), which is two steps left, so not in the way.
- Then move left to (-1,2), which is the 'stop' block. Since there's no wall blocking that path, I can move there.

Once I'm at (-1,2) with the 'stop' block, I can push it in a direction. If I push it left, it would go to (-2,2), which is where the 'is' block is. But that might break the rule further. Alternatively, pushing it up to (-1,3), but I need to see if that helps.

By moving the 'stop' block away, the 'wall is stop' rule is no longer complete. For a rule to be active, all three parts (subject, is, property) need to be connected. If I move the 'stop' block, the connection between 'wall' and 'is' and 'stop' might break, removing the 'wall is stop' rule. That would make walls no longer stoppable, allowing me to walk through them.

Once that's done, I can go around the wall at (2,3) and reach the key at (5,3). So the steps would be:

1. Move to the 'stop' text block at (-1,2).
2. Push it away to break the 'wall is stop' rule.
3. Navigate around the wall to the key.

Alternatively, maybe there's a closer text block to move. The 'is' block is at (-2,2). If I can move that, it would also break the rule. Let's see:

From (0,0), moving left 2 and up 2 to reach (-2,2). Path:

- Up to (0,1), clear.
- Up to (0,2), clear.
- Left to (-1,2), then left to (-2,2). Is there a wall at (-1,2)? The 'stop' block is there, but since we're moving left from (0,2) to (-1,2) to (-2,2), and the 'stop' block is at (-1,2), we need to move around it. Wait, maybe not. If I'm at (0,2) and want to move left to (-1,2), which has the 'stop' block. Since 'stop' is a property of walls, not of the text blocks, I can move the 'stop' block. So first, move to (-1,2) and take the 'stop' block, then move it left to (-2,2), which is where the 'is' block is. But that might connect the 'is' and 'stop' blocks, forming a new rule? Not sure. Alternatively, moving the 'is' block away would break the rule.

This is getting a bit complicated. Maybe the simplest way is to focus on moving the 'stop' block to break the 'wall is stop' rule.

So, the action plan is:

- Move left and up to reach the 'stop' block.
- Push the 'stop' block to a new position, breaking the rule.
- Now, walls are not stop, so move right past the wall at (2,3) to reach the key.

But how to execute this in the given actions? The possible actions are idle, up, right, down, left.

The user needs to choose one action at a time. So the first step is to move towards the 'stop' block.

From the current position (assumed to be at 0,0), the 'stop' block is at (-1,2). To get there, need to move left once and up twice.

But each action is a single step. So first, move up. Then left. Then up again. But the observation shows that after previous actions, the position of objects might have changed. Wait, the observations provided after each action show the updated positions. However, in the latest observation provided, after several right and left movements, the key is getting closer.

Wait, looking at the latest observation:

Objects on the map include the key at 6 steps to the right. But in the previous steps, the assistant moved right multiple times, and the key's position relative to Baba might be changing.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to move right towards the key, assuming that the path is clear. But there's a wall at 2 steps right. If I can make that wall not stop, then moving right past it is possible.

Alternatively, maybe the ball at 3 steps right, 2 steps up can be used to push the wall. But the ball's properties aren't defined, so unless I create a rule that makes the ball a pusher or something, it won't help.

Another angle: The 'key is win' rule means that having the key in your possession wins. But in Baba Is You, usually, you have to touch the object. So maybe moving the key to Baba's position. But the key is a separate object; you can't pick it up unless there's a rule allowing it. The default is that you can push objects unless they are stop.

Since the wall is stop, but the key might not be. If the key isn't stop, I can push it. But the active rules don't specify the key's properties except that it's win. So maybe the key can be moved.

If I can move the key to Baba's position, that would win. But the key is at 5 steps right, 3 up. To move it, I need to be adjacent and push it. But there's a wall at 2 steps right, 3 up. If that wall is stop, I can't push past it unless I move the wall.

This circles back to the need to break the 'wall is stop' rule.

So, the crux is to manipulate the rules to remove 'wall is stop'. The most straightforward way is to move the 'stop' text block.

Given that, the next action should be to move towards the 'stop' block. But how to do that in one step?

In the current observation, Baba's position is where the 'baba' rule is, which is 3 steps left and 3 steps down from the reference point. The 'stop' block is 1 step left and 2 steps up from there. So relative to Baba, the 'stop' block is:

Left: 3 steps left (Baba's position) + 1 step left = 4 steps left from the reference? Wait, this is getting confusing. Perhaps it's better to consider the direction from Baba's current position.

If the 'stop' block is 1 step to the left and 2 steps up from Baba's current position, then the action would be to move left and up. But each action is a single step. So first, move up, then left, then up again. But the system might require a single action per turn.

Alternatively, maybe the 'stop' block is in a position that can be reached with a single move. For example, if it's one step up and one step left, then combining those into a diagonal move isn't possible, but the game might not allow diagonal moves. You have to move in one direction at a time","

Let's try to figure out how to solve this Baba Is You level. The active rules right now are ""key is win"", ""wall is stop"", and ""baba is you"". So, the goal is to get the key, which is also considered the win condition. But there's a door somewhere that might be blocking the way.

Looking at the objects on the map, the key is 6 steps to the right. But between me (Baba) and the key, there's a wall at 2 steps to the right. Wait, the wall is defined as stop, so I can't move through it. But maybe I can rearrange the rules to bypass it. 

The rule ""wall is stop"" is important here. If I can change that rule, maybe the wall becomes something else that I can pass through. To do that, I need to move the ""stop"" text block. Let me check where the text blocks are. There's a rule ""stop"" 1 step to the left and 2 steps up. So, if I can move that ""stop"" block somewhere else, perhaps I can alter the wall's property.

But how do I move the text blocks? I have to move them adjacent to them, right? And I can only move objects that aren't stopped. Since I'm Baba and ""baba is you"", I can move unless there's a stop rule preventing it. Let me see if any of the walls are blocking my movement to the text blocks. The wall at 2 steps right and 2 steps up might be in the way. 

Wait, if I move up towards the ""stop"" rule, there's a wall at 2 steps right and 2 steps up. But the rule ""wall is stop"" means that wall is immovable. So I can't go around it. Hmm. Maybe I need to find another path. Let's look at the other text blocks. There's a ""key"", ""is"", and ""win"" rules to the right of the key. Maybe if I rearrange those to create a new rule that allows me to pass through the wall.

Alternatively, since the key is the win condition, maybe if I can reach the key, that's enough. But the wall is in the way. If I can make the wall not a stop, then I can pass through it. To do that, I need to move the ""stop"" text block away from the wall's rule. The current ""wall is stop"" rule is made up of the ""wall"" text block 3 steps left and 2 steps up, then ""is"" 2 steps left and 2 steps up, and ""stop"" 1 step left and 2 steps up. So the ""stop"" is attached to the ""wall"" rule.

If I can separate those text blocks, maybe I can change the wall's property. For example, if I move the ""stop"" block to another part of the rule, like attaching it to Baba instead. But would that work? Let's think. If I make ""baba is stop"", then Baba would be stop, which means I can't move. That's bad. So maybe instead, create a new rule like ""wall is you"", which would make the wall controllable. But how?

Alternatively, maybe rearrange the existing rules. The ""key is win"" rule is at 7 steps right, 3 steps up. The ""is"" is at 8 steps right, 3 steps up, and ""win"" at 9 steps right, 3 steps up. If I can break that rule apart, maybe I can use the ""win"" text block elsewhere. For example, making ""baba is win"" so that touching Baba makes me win. But how would that help? If I'm already Baba and ""you"", then maybe that's redundant. Hmm.

Wait, the current active rules are ""key is win"", ""wall is stop"", and ""baba is you"". So the goal is to touch the key, which is also the win condition. But the key is behind a wall. So I need to either move the wall, remove the stop property from it, or find another way around.

Looking at the objects, there's a ball at 3 steps right, 2 steps up. Not sure if that's useful. The door is at 5 steps right, 1 step up. But I don't have a door-key pair here. The key is at 6 steps right. So maybe the door is a red herring, or maybe I need to get past it another way.

Back to the text blocks. The ""stop"" rule is at 1 step left and 2 steps up. If I can move that ""stop"" block away from the ""wall is stop"" rule, then the wall might no longer be a stop. For example, if I move the ""stop"" block to attach to the key, making ""key is stop"", but that would make the key impassable, which is bad because I need to get it. Alternatively, move ""stop"" to attach to Baba, but that would make me stop, which is not good.

Alternatively, create a new rule like ""you is push"" or something, but I don't have a ""push"" text block. Wait, the available text blocks are key, is, win, wall, stop, door, baba, you. So maybe combine them differently.

Another idea: Since the key is win, maybe I don't need to pick up the key, just touch it. But the wall is blocking the path. So if I can make the wall not a stop, then I can walk through it. To do that, I need to change the ""wall is stop"" rule. How? By moving the ""stop"" text block from the wall's rule to another rule.

The ""wall is stop"" rule is composed of three text blocks: ""wall"" at 3 left, 2 up; ""is"" at 2 left, 2 up; ""stop"" at 1 left, 2 up. To break this rule, I need to move one of these text blocks. The ""stop"" block is the one defining the property. If I can move the ""stop"" block away, then the wall would no longer be stop.

So, the plan is to move the ""stop"" block from its current position (1 left, 2 up) to another location. For example, attach it to the ""baba"" rule. The ""baba is you"" rule is at 1 left, 2 down; ""is"" at 2 down; ""you"" at 1 right, 2 down. If I can move the ""stop"" block here, making ""baba is stop you"", but that might not make sense. Alternatively, create a new rule like ""baba is stop"", which would make Baba stop, preventing movement. Not helpful.

Alternatively, move the ""stop"" block to attach to the key's rule. The key's rule is at 5 right, 3 up; ""is"" at 6 right, 3 up; ""win"" at 7 right, 3 up. If I attach ""stop"" here, making ""key is stop win"", then the key would be both stop and win. But since the active rule is ""key is win"", the ""stop"" might override it, making the key a stop. That's bad because I can't touch it then.

Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe another approach: Use the ""is"" text block to create a new rule. For example, if I can move the ""is"" block from the wall's rule to create ""baba is stop"", but again, that would make me stop. Not good.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""wall"" text block. The ""wall"" block in the ""wall is stop"" rule is at 3 left, 2 up. If I can move that ""wall"" block somewhere else, then the rule would break. For example, moving the ""wall"" block next to the ""baba"" rule. Then the rule would be ""baba is stop"", which again makes me stop. Not helpful.

Alternatively, move the ""wall"" block to create a new rule like ""door is wall"". Then the door would be a wall, but I don't know if that helps. The door is at 5 right, 1 up. If it becomes a wall, maybe I can push it or something. But I don't have a push rule.

Wait, the active rules don't include any push rules. So maybe that's not useful.

Another angle: The ""key is win"" rule means that touching the key makes me win. So even if I can't reach it by moving through, maybe I can manipulate the rules to make the key reachable. For example, if I can make the wall not a stop, then I can walk through it.

To make the wall not a stop, I need to remove the ""stop"" property from it. The ""wall is stop"" rule is created by the text blocks: wall, is, stop in that order. If I can break this rule by moving one of the text blocks, then the wall's property changes.

The ""stop"" block is crucial here. If I can move the ""stop"" block away from the ""wall is"" sequence, then the rule is broken. So the plan is to move the ""stop"" block to another part of the map, perhaps attaching it to another rule.

Looking at the available text blocks, there's a ""you"" block at 1 right, 2 down. If I can attach the ""stop"" block there, making ""you is stop"", then that would make the you object (which is me, since ""baba is you"") a stop. But that would prevent me from moving. Not good.

Alternatively, attach ""stop"" to the ""baba"" rule. The ""baba is you"" rule is at 1 left, 2 down; ""is"" at 2 down; ""you"" at 1 right, 2 down. If I add ""stop"" here, making ""baba is you stop"", then maybe it would mean Baba is you and stop, which again stops me.

Hmm. Maybe I need to create a new rule that overrides the ""wall is stop"". For example, ""baba is push"", allowing me to push walls. But I don't have a ""push"" text block. The available ones are key, is, win, wall, stop, door, baba, you.

Wait, there's a ""door"" text block. Maybe create a rule like ""door is key"", but that doesn't seem helpful. Or ""door is win"", but the key is already win.

Alternatively, ""baba is door"", making me a door. Then, if there's a door, maybe I can use it. But the door is at 5 right, 1 up. If I become a door, does that help? Not sure.

This is getting complicated. Let's recap. The key is at 6 right, blocked by a wall that's a stop. To get past, need to remove the stop property from the wall. To do that, move the ""stop"" text block from the ""wall is stop"" rule. The ""stop"" block is at 1 left, 2 up. How to reach it?

Looking at my position, I assume I'm at Baba's position, which is at 1 left, 3 steps down (from the rule `baba` 1 step to the left and 3 steps down). So my current location is 1 left, 3 down. The ""stop"" block is at 1 left, 2 up. That's one step up from me. So if I move up once, I can get to the ""stop"" block.

But wait, are there any walls blocking my path to the ""stop"" block? Let's check the objects. Between me (1 left, 3 down) and the ""stop"" block (1 left, 2 up), there's a wall at 2 steps right and 2 steps up. But that wall is part of the ""wall is stop"" rule, which is immovable. So I can't go around it. I'm stuck.

Hmm, so I can't reach the ""stop"" block to move it because there's a wall in the way. This is a problem. Maybe I need to find another way to manipulate the rules without moving the ""stop"" block directly.

Wait, what if I create a new rule that makes the wall something else. For example, ""wall is you"". Then the wall would be controllable. To do that, I need to use the ""is"" and ""you"" text blocks. The ""you"" block is at 1 right, 2 down. The ""is"" block is at 2 step to the left and 3 steps down (from the rule `is` 3 steps down).

So, if I can move the ""you"" block next to the ""wall"" block in the ""wall is stop"" rule, replacing ""stop"" with ""you"". The ""wall"" block is at 3 left, 2 up. The ""is"" block is at 2 left, 2 up. The current ""stop"" is at 1 left, 2 up. If I move the ""you"" block from 1 right, 2 down to 1 left, 2 up, then the rule would become ""wall is you"", making walls controllable.

But how to move the ""you"" block there? My current position is 1 left, 3 down. To get to the ""you"" block at 1 right, 2 down, I need to move right and up. Let's see:

From my position (1 left, 3 down), to reach the ""you"" block at 1 right, 2 down, I need to move right twice and down once. Wait, directions are a bit confusing. Maybe I should visualize the grid.

Assuming that the coordinate system is such that each step changes the position by one step in the specified direction. For example, moving right increases the x-coordinate, up increases the y-coordinate, etc.

But the exact positions are a bit unclear from the observation. Let's try to parse the positions:

- The ""baba"" rule is at 1 step to the left and 3 steps down from somewhere. Assuming the reference point is the center, but it's unclear. Alternatively, the positions are relative to the player's position.

Alternatively, perhaps the objects are positioned relative to the player. For example, ""wall 4 steps to the right and 3 step up"" means there's a wall 4 steps to the right and 3 up from the player's current position.

In that case, the player's position is somewhere, and the walls and rules are placed relative to them. The player (Baba) is likely at a position that allows them to interact with nearby text blocks.

Given that the ""you"" block is at 1 step to the right and 3 steps down from the ""baba"" rule, which is itself 1 step to the left and 3 steps down from the player's position. This is getting a bit too abstract.

Alternatively, let's focus on the actions. The immediate goal is to move the ""stop"" block from the ""wall is stop"" rule. To do that, I need to reach it, but it's blocked by a wall. Maybe I can push the wall? But there's no push rule active.

Alternatively, use the ""win"" property of the key to indirectly reach it. Since the key is win, maybe I can create a rule that makes me win without picking up the key. For example, ""baba is win"", but that's already implicitly true because ""baba is you"" and ""key is win"", but touching the key is required to activate it.

Wait, no. The ""key is win"" rule means that touching the key makes you win. So even if I become win by another rule, I still need to touch the key to win. So that might not help.

Another Idea: If I can make the wall a key, then maybe I can pick it up and use it to open the door. But there's no rule allowing that, and the wall is stop.

Alternatively, create a rule that makes the wall pushable. For example, ""wall is push"". But I don't have a ""push"" text block.

This is really challenging. Let's think differently. Maybe the solution is to move the ""key"" to a different position, but the key is defined by the ""key is win"" rule. If I can break that rule and create a new one, like ""baba is win"", then touching Baba would make me win, which is trivial. But how?

To create ""baba is win"", I need the text blocks ""baba"", ""is"", and ""win"" arranged in that order. The ""win"" block is at 9 steps right, 3 steps up. The ""is"" block is at 8 steps right, 3 steps up. The ""baba"" block is at 1 step left, 3 steps down.

So, if I can move the ""win"" block next to the ""baba"" and ""is"" blocks, forming ""baba is win"", then that rule would activate. But the ""win"" block is currently part of the ""key is win"" rule. To break that, I need to move either the ""key"" or the ""win"" block.

The ""key"" block is at 5 steps right, 3 steps up. If I move the ""win"" block from 9 right, 3 up to somewhere else, adjacent to ""baba"" and ""is"".

The ""baba"" rule is at 1 left, 3 down. The ""is"" block is at 2 left, 3 down. The ""you"" block is at 1 right, 3 down.

So, to form ""baba is win"", I need to place the ""win"" block next to the ""is"" block. The ""is"" block is at 2 left, 3 down. If I can move the ""win"" block from 9 right, 3 up to, say, 1 right, 3 down (adjacent to the ""is"" block), then the rule would be ""baba is win"".

But how to move the ""win"" block there? The ""win"" block is 9 steps right and 3 steps up from the player's position. That's quite far. The player would need to move right multiple times, but there are walls blocking the path.

Alternatively, maybe the player can move diagonally or use other text blocks to push. But I don't see any push rules.

This seems impossible. Maybe the intended solution is to realize that since the key is the win condition, and it's also a key, perhaps you can pick up the key by rearranging the rules. But in Baba Is You, you can't pick up objects; you can only move text blocks to create or break rules.

Wait, another Idea: The ""key is win"" rule means that the key's win property is active. If I can make the key's win property apply to Baba instead, then touching Baba would be the win condition. To do that, create a rule ""baba is win"". To do this, need to move the ""win"" block from the key's rule to the baba's rule.

Let's see. I need to figure out the next move in Baba Is You. The active rules are key is win, wall is stop, and baba is you. My goal is usually to reach the win object, which in this case is the key. But right now, the key is win, so maybe grabbing the key makes me win?

Looking at the objects on the map. Let's parse the positions. The player (Baba) is probably located somewhere, but the observation doesn't explicitly state where I am. Wait, the observation lists other objects but not the player's position. Hmm, maybe I need to infer based on the rules. Since Baba is you, I am Baba. So I must be on the map somewhere. Let me check the objects again.

There's a rule `baba` 3 steps to the left and 3 steps down. Wait, that's probably the text block ""BABA IS YOU"" moved somewhere. But where am I, the actual Baba? Maybe the player's position isn't listed, so I have to figure it out based on the other objects.

Looking at the walls. There's a wall 4 steps to the right in several positions, but in the current observation, walls are at 2 steps to the right in various directions. The key is at 6 steps to the right. The door is at 5 steps to the right and 1 step up. The ball is at 3 steps right and 2 steps up. 

The active rules are key is win, so touching the key would make me win. But the key is at 6 steps to the right. To get there, I need to move right. However, there's a wall at 2 steps right and 1 step up, but maybe I can navigate around. Wait, walls are stop, so I can't move through them. The path to the key might be blocked by walls. Let me check the path.

From my current position (unknown), but assuming I'm near the lower part. There's a rule `baba` 3 steps left and 3 steps down, which might be where I am. If I'm at that position, moving right would take me towards the key. But need to see if the path is clear. There's a wall at 2 steps right and 1 step down, but maybe I can go around. 

Alternatively, maybe I can manipulate the rules. The key is win, so if I can change the rule to make door win instead, but that's not directly helpful. Or perhaps make myself a win by moving ""BABA IS YOU"" next to ""WIN"". Wait, the current active rules have ""key is win"", so to change that, I need to move the ""IS"" or ""WIN"" text blocks.

Looking at the objects: there's a ""win"" text block at 7 steps right and 3 steps up. The ""key"" is at 5 steps right and 3 steps up. The ""is"" is at 6 steps right and 3 steps up. So the rule ""key is win"" is formed by the key, is, and win text blocks arranged horizontally. To change this rule, I could move one of these text blocks. For example, if I can move the ""win"" text block next to ""BABA"", then I could make ""BABA IS WIN"", making Baba win.

But to do that, I need to move the win text block. The win text block is at 7 steps right and 3 steps up. To move it, I have to ensure that the objects I push aren't stopped. The walls are stop, so I can't push past them. Let me see the positions around the win text block. To the left of it is the ""is"" at 6 steps right and 3 steps up, and the key at 5 steps right. So the rule is key-is-win horizontally. To move the ""win"" block, I need to push it, but the space to the right might be blocked by other objects. The next position to the right of win is 8 steps right and 3 steps up, which is empty according to the observation. So maybe I can push the ""win"" block to the right by moving right towards it.

But first, I need to get to the position where I can push the ""win"" block. Let's say I'm currently at the position of the ""baba"" rule, which is 3 steps left and 3 steps down from somewhere. If I move right, maybe I can reach the ""is"" or ""key"" blocks. Alternatively, maybe I'm at the player's starting position, which isn't listed. This is a bit confusing without knowing my exact location.

Alternatively, since the key is win, maybe I just need to grab the key. But the key is at 6 steps right. To get there, I need to move right multiple times. However, there's a wall at 2 steps right and 1 step up, but I'm not sure about the path. Let me map out the possible path. If I'm at position (0,0) as a starting point, then walls are at positions that are 4 steps right in various directions, but in the current observation, walls are at 2 steps right. Maybe the map is smaller here.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is directly to the right of the current position. If I move right four times, I reach the key. But I need to check if there are walls in between. The observation lists a wall at 2 steps right and 1 step up, but that's a wall object, not a text block. The text blocks for wall are at different positions. The ""wall"" rule is at 3 steps left and 2 steps up, which is a text block making walls stop.

So, maybe the path to the key is clear. If I move right, right, right, right, from my current position, I can reach the key at 6 steps right. But I need to confirm if there are any walls blocking the way. The walls are at specific positions, like 2 steps right and 2 steps up, but those are wall objects, not paths. The text blocks for walls define where the stoppers are.

Wait, the active rule is ""wall is stop"", so any object labeled wall is stop. The wall objects are at various positions, like 4 steps right in different directions, but in the current observation, they're at 2 steps right and various steps up/down. So, when moving right, I need to ensure that the next step isn't a wall object.

Looking at the objects on the map:

- wall at 2 steps right and 3 step up
- wall at 2 steps right and 2 step up
- wall at 2 steps right and 1 step up
- wall at 2 steps right (base)
- wall at 2 steps right and 1 step down
- wall at 2 steps right and 2 steps down
- wall at 2 steps right and 3 steps down

So, if I'm moving right from my current position, say from position (0,0), moving right four times would take me to 4 steps right, but there's a wall at 2 steps right. Wait, but the walls are at 2 steps right in various directions. Maybe the player is at a position where moving right is possible.

Alternatively, maybe the player is at the position of the ""baba"" rule, which is 3 steps left and 3 steps down from somewhere. If I move right three times, I could reach the ""baba"" text block's position, but that's a text block, not the player. I'm confused about the player's location.

This is getting complicated. Maybe the simplest action is to keep moving right towards the key, assuming there's a clear path. Alternatively, try to rearrange the rules to make ""BABA IS WIN"" so that touching any Baba (myself) makes me win. That could be a better strategy.

To do that, I need to move the ""win"" text block next to the ""BABA"" text block. The ""BABA"" text block is at 3 steps left and 3 steps down relative to something, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the ""BABA IS YOU"" rule is made of three text blocks: ""baba"", ""is"", ""you"". If I can move the ""you"" to ""win"", making ""baba is win"", then Baba would be win.

The ""you"" text block is at 1 step left and 3 steps down. The ""win"" text block is at 7 steps right and 3 steps up. To move the ""you"" to ""win"", I need to push it, but obstacles might be in the way. Alternatively, move the ""win"" block to the ""baba"" block.

But moving the ""win"" block requires pushing it past other objects. The ""win"" is at 7 steps right, 3 steps up. To the right of it is empty. So if I can move right towards the ""win"" block, maybe I can push it. But I need to be adjacent to it.

Alternatively, maybe the current strategy of moving right to get the key is better. Since key is win, grabbing it should make me win. But I need to check if the path is clear.

Assuming I'm near the bottom, and the key is to the right, I can keep moving right. The observation shows that after moving right a few times, the key's position is at 6 steps right. Each ""right"" action moves me one step right. So if I've been moving right before, now I need to continue.

But in the previous observations, after moving right multiple times, the positions of the key and other objects shift. For example, after moving right once, the key is at 5 steps right, then 4, etc. So the correct action would be to keep moving right until I reach the key.

Alternatively, if there's a wall blocking the path, I need to find another way. But based on the current observation, the walls are at 2 steps right and various directions, which might not be on the direct path to the key.

Another angle: the door is at 5 steps right and 1 step up. If I can open the door, but the door's rule is not specified. The active rules are key is win, wall is stop. There's no rule about door, so it's passable unless blocked by stop (wall).

But the key is win, so maybe the key is the only way to win. Therefore, prioritizing grabbing the key makes sense.

So, the chosen action is to keep moving right towards the key. Each time I move right, the key's distance decreases. In the latest observation, the key is at 6 steps right, so moving right once would get closer. But need to confirm the exact number of steps required.

Alternatively, maybe the key is directly to the right, so moving right once is enough. But based on the previous steps, the user has been moving right and the key's position is decrementing by one each time. So in the current observation, the key is at 6 steps right, so moving right would make it 5, but the goal is to reach it. Wait, no—if the key is at 6 steps right, moving right once would place me at 7 steps right, which is next to the key? Or is the key's position relative to me?

This is a bit unclear without knowing the player's position. But given the pattern in previous steps, each time the assistant moved right, the key's position shifted right by one. So to reach the key, they need to move right until they are adjacent to it.

In the current observation, the key is at 6 steps right. So if the player is one step left of the key, moving right once would reach it. Therefore, the action should be right.

Let's try to figure out how to solve this Baba Is You level. The active rules are key is win, wall is stop, and baba is you. So, the goal is to get to the key, which is currently acting as the win condition. But the key is probably blocked by walls or other stop objects.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ball at 3 steps to the right and 2 steps up. Wait, no, the ball is at 3 steps to the right and 2 steps up? Wait, no, let me check again. The objects are listed as:

- wall 2 steps to the right and 2 step up
- ball 3 steps to the right and 2 step up
- wall 2 steps to the right and 1 step up
- rule door at 5 steps to the right and 1 step up
- key at 6 steps to the right

Wait, the key is to the right of the door. But there are walls blocking the path. The key is win, so if I can reach it, I win. But the wall is stop, so I need to move those walls or find a way around.

Since I'm Baba, and baba is you, I can move. The problem is the walls. The walls are stop, meaning I can't pass through them. So how do I get past them? Maybe by changing the rules. For example, if I can make the wall not a stop, or make myself able to go through walls.

The available text blocks are the rules: key is win, wall is stop, and baba is you. Also, there are other rules like rule `wall` 1 step to the left and 2 step up, which is part of another rule ""wall is stop"" maybe? Not sure. But the key is that I can move the text blocks to create new rules.

Looking at the positions:

The rule `key` is at 5 steps right, 3 up. The `is` is next to it, then `win`. So that's the ""key is win"" rule. Similarly, there's a ""wall is stop"" rule made of `wall`, `is`, `stop`. And ""baba is you"" from `baba`, `is`, `you`.

Now, to manipulate these, I need to move the text blocks to change the rules. For example, if I can take the `stop` property and attach it to something else, like making ""stop is key"" or something, but that might not help. Alternatively, maybe make ""you is win"" so that I (as you) can be win by just existing.

Alternatively, since the key is win, if I can reach the key, I win. But the key is behind walls. So perhaps I need to remove the stop property from the walls. To do that, I can take the `stop` text block and move it somewhere else. For example, if I can create a rule like ""floor is stop"" or ""wall is key"", but that might not be useful.

Wait, the walls are made of blocks that are 4 steps to the right in various positions. Maybe the walls are part of the level layout, not just the rules. So the physical walls are on the map, and their stop property comes from the ""wall is stop"" rule.

So to pass through the walls, I need to either remove the ""wall is stop"" rule or change the property of the walls. But how? The rules are made of text blocks that I can move. So if I can take the `stop` text block and move it away, then walls wouldn't be stop anymore. But where can I put it? Maybe attach it to another object, like ""stop is key"" or ""stop is you"". But I'm not sure if that would make walls passable.

Alternatively, if I can create a new rule that says ""baba is stop"", but then I would be stop and can't move. Not helpful.

Wait, the active rules are key is win, wall is stop, baba is you. So the priority might be that if there are conflicting rules, the last one defined takes precedence. But in this case, the rules are all on the same level.

Another approach: The ball is at 3 steps right and 2 steps up. The key is at 6 steps right. There's a door at 5 steps right and 1 step up. The door might be a door that requires the key to open. But since key is win, maybe the door is irrelevant. Or maybe the door is a separate thing. The rule `door` is at 7 steps right and 1 step up in previous observations, but in the current one, the door is at 5 steps right and 1 step up.

Wait, in the current observation, the door is at 5 steps to the right and 1 step up. The key is at 6 steps to the right. So between the door and the key is a wall at 5 steps right and 1 step up, then the key at 6 steps right. So to get to the key, I need to go through the door, but the door is at 5,1 which is one step left of the key. Wait, no: the key is at 6 steps right, so from the door at 5,1, moving right once gets to the key. But the wall is at 5 steps right and 1 step up, which is directly above the door? Or is the wall at 5 steps right and 1 step up blocking the path?

Wait, the walls are positioned as:

- wall 1 step to the right and 3 step up
- ...
- wall 1 step to the right and 2 step up
- wall 1 step to the right and 1 step up
- rule door 4 steps to the right and 1 step up
- wall 1 step to the right
- key 5 steps to the right
- wall 1 step to the right and 1 step down
- etc.

Hmm, maybe the layout is a bit confusing. Let me try to visualize:

Assuming the player (Baba) is at the starting position, probably near the bottom. The walls are spread out in various directions. The key is at 5 steps right, so to the right of the current position. But there's a wall at 1 step right and 1 step up, then another wall at 1 step right, which is directly to the right. So to move right, you hit a wall. But the key is further right at 5 steps. So how to get there?

The ball is at 3 steps right and 2 steps up. Maybe the ball can be used to push walls? But the problem is that the walls are stop, so you can't push them if you're stop. Wait, no: if you're Baba (you), and the walls are stop, you can't push them. Unless you change the rules.

So the key is at 5 steps right, but there's a wall at 1 step right. So moving right once would hit the wall. But the key is five steps right, so you need to move right four times, but each step is blocked by walls. Unless you can move the walls by changing the rules.

The solution likely involves manipulating the ""wall is stop"" rule. If I can remove the ""stop"" property from walls, then they become passable. To do that, I need to move the ""stop"" text block from the ""wall is stop"" rule to another object. For example, create a new rule like ""floor is stop"" or ""key is stop"", but that might not help. Alternatively, create a rule that says ""stop is you"", making Baba stop, which is bad. Hmm.

Alternatively, create a rule that says ""baba is stop"", but then you can't move. Not helpful. Alternatively, make the walls not stop by redefining them. For example, if I can create a rule ""wall is key"", then the walls would be key, and since key is win, reaching a wall would win, which is not good. But maybe that's not the intention.

Wait, another idea: If I can create a rule that says ""baba is win"", then just existing as Baba would make you win. But the current active rule is ""key is win"", so that would conflict. However, in Baba Is You, the last rule defined for a property takes precedence. So if I create a new rule ""baba is win"" after ""key is win"", then baba would be win. So maybe that's the way.

To do that, I need to move the existing ""key is win"" rule and create a new ""baba is win"" rule. Let's see where the text blocks are.

Looking at the current objects:

- rule `key` 4 steps to the right and 3 step up
- rule `is` 5 steps to the right and 3 step up
- rule `win` 6 steps to the right and 3 step up
So the ""key is win"" rule is at positions (4,3), (5,3), (6,3).

To create a ""baba is win"" rule, I need to find the `baba`, `is`, and `win` text blocks. The `baba` rule is at 4 steps left and 3 steps down, along with `is` and `you`. Specifically:

- rule `baba` 4 step to the left and 3 steps down
- rule `is` 3 step to the left and 3 steps down
- rule `you` 2 step to the left and 3 steps down

The `win` text block is already part of the ""key is win"" rule at (6,3). So to make ""baba is win"", I need to move the `win` block from the key rule to the baba rule.

So the steps would be:

1. Move the `win` block (at 6,3) to the position after the `baba` and `is` blocks. The baba rule is at (4,-3), (3,-3), (2,-3) assuming the directions are relative. Wait, the observation says:

rule `baba` 4 step to the left and 3 steps down
rule `is` 3 step to the left and 3 steps down
rule `you` 2 step to the left and 3 steps down

So their positions are, assuming the player is at (0,0):

- baba: (-4, -3)
- is: (-3, -3)
- you: (-2, -3)

The `win` block is at (6,3). So to create ""baba is win"", I need to move the `win` block to after the `baba` and `is` blocks. So place it at (-1, -3) to complete ""baba is win"".

Once that's done, the active rules would be:

- key is win (original)
- wall is stop (original)
- baba is you (original)
- baba is win (new)

Since the last rule for ""baba"" is ""baba is win"", then according to the game rules, the last defined rule takes precedence. So baba would be win, meaning just by existing, you win. So the solution would be to rearrange the text blocks to create ""baba is win"".

To do that, the action would be to move the `win` block from its current position (6,3) to the position after the `baba` and `is` blocks. The `baba` rule is at (-4,-3), `is` at (-3,-3), so placing `win` at (-2,-3) would make ""baba is win"".

But how to move the blocks? The player (Baba) is presumably at the starting position, which isn't explicitly stated, but based on the walls, maybe at (1,0) or similar. To move the `win` block, the player needs to navigate to its location at (6,3), then move it to (-2,-3).

But the path might be blocked by walls. The walls are at various positions, but if the ""wall is stop"" rule is still active, moving through walls is impossible. So this approach requires changing the rules first to be able to move freely.

Alternatively, maybe there's a different way. Since the key is win, and the key is at (5,0) (assuming steps are in grid coordinates), but the key is at 5 steps to the right, which would be (5,0). But there's a wall at (1,0), blocking the path. So to get to the key at (5,0), you need to go around the walls.

But the walls are spread out. Maybe the solution is to push a wall out of the way by rearranging the rules. For example, if you can make the wall not stop, then you can move through it. But to do that, you need to move the `stop` property.

The `stop` block is part of the ""wall is stop"" rule at (-1,2) (assuming the rule is at 1 step left and 2 step up). So the `stop` block is at (-1,2). If I can move that `stop` block to another part of the rule, like making ""stop is key"", then walls wouldn't be stop anymore.

But how to do that? The player needs to move the `stop` block from its current position to another location. For example, to create ""stop is key"", you would need the `stop`, `is`, and `key` blocks. The `key` block is at (4,3), `is` is at (5,3), so placing `stop` at (6,3) would make ""stop is key"". But the `win` block is already there. So you would have to rearrange those.

But this might be complicated. Alternatively, if I can create a rule that says ""you is stop"", then since you are Baba (you), you would be stop, which prevents you from moving. Not helpful.

Another angle: The ball is at (3,2). Maybe the ball can be used to push walls. But if the walls are stop, you can't push them. Unless you change the rule to make walls pushable. For example, if ""wall is push"", but that requires redefining the wall's properties.

Alternatively, if you can make the ball a stop, then pushing it would block your path. Not helpful.

Hmm, this is tricky. Let's recap:

Active rules:
1. key is win
2. wall is stop
3. baba is you

Objects:
- key at (5,0)
- walls blocking the path to the key
- text blocks for creating new rules scattered around.

The solution likely involves either:

A) Changing the ""key is win"" to ""baba is win"" so that reaching the key isn't necessary.

B) Removing the ""wall is stop"" rule to be able to walk through walls.

C) Using the ball to move walls, but since walls are stop, you can't push them.

Option A seems feasible. To do that, you need to create a ""baba is win"" rule. The necessary text blocks are `baba`, `is`, and `win`. The `baba` and `is` blocks are at (-4,-3), (-3,-3), and the `win` block is at (6,3). So the player needs to move the `win` block to the position after `baba` and `is`, which would be at (-2,-3).

To move the `win` block from (6,3) to (-2,-3), the player needs to navigate from their current position to (6,3), then move left and down to (-2,-3). However, the path might be blocked by walls. If the walls are still stop, this is impossible. Therefore, this approach requires first removing the ""wall is stop"" rule.

To remove ""wall is stop"", you need to move the `stop` block from its current position. The `stop` block is part of the ""wall is stop"" rule at (-1,2) (assuming the rule is at 1 step left and 2 step up). So the `stop` block is at (-1,2). If you can move this `stop` block elsewhere, say to create a new rule like ""floor is stop"" or ""key is stop"", then walls would no longer be stop.

For example, create ""floor is stop"" by using the `floor` text block (if present) and the `stop` block. But the observation doesn't mention a floor object. Alternatively, create ""key is stop"", which would make the key a stop, but that's at (5,0), so you couldn't move past it. Not helpful.

Alternatively, create ""baba is stop"", but that would make you stop. Not good.

Hmm. Maybe the best approach is to first remove the ""wall is stop"" rule by moving the `stop` block away, then create ""baba is win"".

So steps:

1. Move the `stop` block from (-1,2) to somewhere else, say next to the `key` rule to create ""stop is key"". This would make walls not stop anymore.

2. Then, create ""baba is win"" by moving the `win` block to the `baba` rule.

But how to do this in actions? The player needs to move the blocks one by one.

Assuming the player is at the starting position, perhaps near the bottom. Let's say the player is at (0,0).

First, move right to reach the `stop` block at (-1,2). Wait, directions are relative. If the `stop` block is 1 step left and 2 steps up from somewhere, maybe the player needs to move left and up.

This is getting complicated. Maybe the intended solution is to realize that since the key is win, and you are Baba (you), if you can make yourself win by creating ""baba is win"", then you don't need to move to the key.

To do that, you need to rearrange the text blocks to form ""baba is win"". The `baba`, `is`, and `win` blocks are available. The `win` block is currently part of the ""key is win"" rule. So the player needs to move the `win` block from the key rule to the baba rule.

The positions are:

- Key rule: (4,3) - key, (5,3) - is, (6,3) - win.

- Baba rule: (-4,-3) - baba, (-3,-3) - is, (-2,-3) - you.

To create ""baba is win"", the player needs to move the `win` block from (6,3) to (-2,-3), placing it after the `baba` and `is` blocks.

So the sequence of actions would be:

1. Move right three times to reach (3,3) to get to the `win` block at (6,3). Wait, no. If the player is at (0,0","

Let me try to figure this out. The goal is to reach the key, which is set as the win condition. But how?

The current active rules are key is win, wall is stop, and baba is you. Since baba is you, I can move as Baba. The key is to the right, but there are walls blocking the path. The walls are marked as stop, so I can't move through them. But maybe there's a way to change the rules to bypass them.

Looking at the objects, there's a ball nearby. Maybe I can use that? Wait, the rules are key is win, so maybe I need to pick up the key. But the key is several steps to the right, past some walls. Let me check the map layout again.

The player (Baba) is probably at the position of the ""baba"" text block. According to the observation, the rule `baba` is 4 steps to the left and 3 steps down from the current position. Wait, maybe I need to adjust my perspective. Let me try to visualize the grid.

The key is at 6 steps to the right and 3 steps up. But there's a wall at 4 steps right and 3 up. Also, other walls are blocking the path. The door is at 4 steps right and 1 step up. Maybe the door can be opened by the key once I have it. But how to get past the walls?

Since walls are stop, I can't push them unless there's a rule allowing it. But the current rules don't mention that. However, I can manipulate text blocks to change rules. For example, if I can make wall not a stop, then I could move through them. Or maybe change the win condition to something else.

Looking at the text blocks on the map: there's a rule `key is win`, `wall is stop`, and `baba is you`. Also, there are other rules like `door` and `is` blocks scattered around. If I can rearrange these text blocks to create new rules, maybe I can override the existing ones.

For instance, if I can move the `is` block next to `wall` and change its property to something else, like ""push"" or ""lose"". But how do I move the text blocks? I need to be adjacent to them and not being stopped. Let's see where I am.

Assuming I'm at the position of the `baba` rule, which is 4 steps left and 3 steps down from the current view. Wait, the observation lists objects relative to the player's position. The player is likely at (0,0), and other objects are positioned relative to that.

So the key is at (6,3). There's a wall at (4,3). To get to the key, I need to go right past the wall at (4,3). But since wall is stop, I can't. Maybe I can move the `wall is stop` rule to change what makes a wall stop. For example, if I can make `stop` apply to something else, like the door, then walls wouldn't block me.

Alternatively, if I can make myself (Baba) able to push walls. But there's no rule for that. However, if I can create a rule like ""baba is push"", then maybe I can move walls. But how to do that?

The text blocks needed for that would be ""baba"", ""is"", and ""push"". Are these available? Let's check the objects. The current rules include `baba is you`, `key is win`, and `wall is stop`. There are other `is` blocks and rules scattered around. For example, there's a `rule 'is' 3 steps down` and `rule 'you' 1 step to the left and 3 steps down`.

If I can move the `is` block next to `baba` and change its property to `push`, then I could push walls. But the problem is that I need to navigate to those text blocks and rearrange them. However, the walls might be in the way. Let's see the positions:

- The `baba` rule is at 4 steps left and 3 steps down from me. So to reach it, I need to move left and down, but there might be walls blocking that path. Alternatively, maybe I can move to the `is` blocks nearby.

Another approach: The key is win, so if I can pick up the key, that would satisfy the win condition. But how to get to the key. The key is at (6,3), but there's a wall at (4,3). Maybe if I can move the wall. But walls are stop, so can't be pushed unless there's a rule allowing it.

Wait, maybe there's a door at (4,1). If I can open the door with the key, that might provide a path. But how to reach the door. The door is at (4,1), which is one step down from (4,2). But to get to (4,1), I need to move down, but there's a wall at (2,2) step up? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I can change the rule `key is win` to `key is door`, so that grabbing the key opens the door. But again, I need to manipulate the text blocks to do that.

Let me think step by step. My current position is likely where the `baba` rule is, which is 4 steps left and 3 steps down. So to move right, I can go towards the key. But the wall at (4,3) is blocking. If I can move that wall's rule, perhaps by rearranging the text blocks.

The `wall is stop` rule is at 2 steps left and 2 steps up. So if I can move that `is` block next to `wall` to a different property, like `push`, then walls wouldn't block. But how to reach that `is` block. The `is` block is at 2 steps left and 2 steps up from me. To get there, I need to move left and up, but am I blocked?

Looking at the objects: there's a wall at 1 step right and 2 steps up. So moving up from my position would take me to (0,1), but there's a wall at (1,2). Wait, maybe my coordinates are different. This is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should try to move right towards the key, step by step, and see if I can find a way around.

Alternatively, since the key is the win object, maybe I can move the `win` rule to the key's position. The `win` rule is at 6 steps right and 3 steps up. So if I can move that `win` block onto the key, then grabbing the key would trigger the win. But how to move the `win` block. I need to be adjacent to it and move it in a direction, but I have to avoid walls.

The `win` block is at (6,3). To move it left, I need to go towards (5,3), but is there a path? There's a wall at (4,3), which is blocking. So perhaps I need to move the wall first. But again, walls are stop.

This seems tricky. Maybe another approach: since ""baba is you"", I can move as Baba. If I can change the ""stop"" property to something else, like ""nothing"", then walls wouldn't block. To do that, I need to find the `stop` rule and change it.

The `stop` rule is at 1 step left and 2 steps up. So if I can move that `stop` block next to a different property, like making `wall` not stop. For example, changing `wall is stop` to `wall is nothing`. To do that, I need to rearrange the text blocks: move the `is` between `wall` and `stop` to `nothing`.

But to do that, I need to be adjacent to the `stop` rule and move its components. Let's see. The `stop` rule is composed of `rule 'stop' 1 step to the left and 2 step up`. Wait, no—the `stop` rule is part of the original rules: ""wall is stop"". The text blocks for that would be `rule 'wall'`, `rule 'is'`, and `rule 'stop'` positioned together.

Looking at the objects, there's a `rule 'wall'` at 3 steps left and 2 steps up, a `rule 'is'` at 2 steps left and 2 steps up, and a `rule 'stop'` at 1 step left and 2 steps up. So these three blocks form the ""wall is stop"" rule. If I can move the `is` block to connect `wall` to a different property, like `nothing`, then I can remove the stop property from walls.

To do that, I need to move the `is` block that's between `wall` and `stop` to be between `wall` and `nothing`. But where is the `nothing` text block? I don't see it in the objects. So I can't create a new `nothing` block unless it's already there. Hmm, that's a problem.

Alternatively, maybe there's another property I can use. For example, if I can make walls pushable. But again, there's no `push` block unless I can create it by rearranging existing text blocks. But the available text blocks are key, is, win, wall, stop, door, baba, you.

Wait, there's a `rule 'you'` at 1 step left and 3 steps down. Maybe I can use that. If I can make Baba (who is you) able to push walls by creating a rule like ""baba is push"". To do that, I need to find the `baba` rule, the `is` block, and the `push` block. But there's no `push` block. However, maybe I can use another existing block. For example, ""key"" is win, but that's not helpful.

This is getting complicated. Maybe the simplest way is to move right towards the key, ignoring the walls for now, and see if there's a way around. But walls are stop, so I can't. Alternatively, maybe the door can be opened with the key. If I can reach the door and then use the key, but how?

The door is at 4 steps right and 1 step up. To get there, I need to move right four times and up once. But there's a wall at 4 steps right and 3 steps up, which is blocking the direct path. Maybe there's a detour. Let's map out the path:

From my current position (assuming I'm at the start where baba is you), moving right towards the key:

- Step right to (1,0): Is there a wall? Yes, wall at 2 steps right and 2 step up. Wait, not sure. Maybe the walls are in specific positions. Let me check the objects again.

Looking at the objects:

- wall 2 steps to the right and 3 step up
- rule `key` 5 steps to the right and 3 step up
- rule `is` 6 steps to the right and 3 step up
- rule `win` 7 steps to the right and 3 step up
- rule `wall` 3 step to the left and 2 step up
- rule `is` 2 step to the left and 2 step up
- rule `stop` 1 step to the left and 2 step up
- wall 2 steps to the right and 2 step up
- ball 3 steps to the right and 2 step up
- wall 2 steps to the right and 1 step up
- rule `door` 4 steps to the right and 1 step up
- wall 2 steps to the right
- key 5 steps to the right
- wall 2 steps to the right and 1 step down
- etc.

This is quite dense. Maybe the key is at (5,3), and there's a wall at (4,3). To get past that wall, I need to either move the wall's rule or change its property. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the ball at (3,2) can be used. If I can push the ball, but there's no rule allowing that. Unless I create a rule like ""ball is push"", but again, no push block.

Wait, the `baba is you` rule means I can move Baba. If I can create a rule that allows me to push walls by making ""baba is push"", then maybe. To do that, I need to find the `baba` rule, the `is` block, and the `push` block. But there's no `push` block. Unless I can use another existing block as push. For example, maybe use ""key"" as push, but that would change the key's property.

This is tricky. Let me focus on moving the `is` block that's part of the ""wall is stop"" rule. If I can move that `is` to connect `wall` to something else, like `nothing`, then walls wouldn't block. But again, I need a `nothing` block.

Alternatively, if I can make ""stop"" apply to something else, like the door. For example, changing ""door is stop"" to ""door is nothing"". But there's no door is stop rule currently. The door is just a object; its property is not defined except maybe by the `door` rule, which might not do anything.

Wait, the active rules are key is win, wall is stop, and baba is you. The door's rule is just a text block saying ""door"", which might not have any effect unless combined with an ""is"" rule. So if I can create a rule like ""door is key"" or something, but that's not helpful.

Another idea: Since the key is win, maybe I can take the key and reach it even if walls are in the way by changing the rules on the fly. For example, if I can make walls non-stop by rearranging the ""wall is stop"" rule.

The ""wall is stop"" rule is made up of three text blocks: `rule 'wall'`, `rule 'is'`, and `rule 'stop'`. If I can separate these blocks and reconnect them to form a new rule, like ""stop is wall"", then maybe stops would be walls, but that doesn't help. Or ""wall is key"", which would make walls act as keys, but then collecting a wall would bewin, which is not desired.

Alternatively, if I can make ""baba is stop"", then I would be blocked, which is bad. So that's not helpful.

Wait, the player is Baba, who is you. So if I can make ""you is stop"", then I would be blocked. But I need to avoid that.

This is really challenging. Maybe the solution is to move the key to the win position. The key is already set as win, so that's not necessary. Alternatively, pick up the key by moving to its position and taking it, but how?

In Baba Is You, to pick up an object, you need to be adjacent to it and have a rule that allows it. Since the key is the win object, maybe just being adjacent to it is enough, but the active rule is ""key is win"", which means when you touch the key, you win. So maybe I just need to move to the key's position.

But the path is blocked by walls. So I need to find a way to remove the walls or move around them.

Another approach: Use the ball. If the ball can be moved, maybe push it out of the way. But there's no rule allowing that. Unless I create a rule like ""baba is push"", then I can push objects. But again, no push block.

Wait, the available text blocks include ""key"", ""is"", ""win"", ""wall"", ""stop"", ""door"", ""baba"", ""you"". If I can create a rule like ""baba is push"" using these blocks. The ""baba"" rule is at 4 steps left and 3 steps down. The ""is"" blocks are scattered around. If I can move an ""is"" block next to ""baba"" and then add ""push"", but there's no ""push"" block. However, maybe ""key"" can be used as ""push"". If I create ""baba is key"", then maybe, but that would make baba a key, which might not help.

Alternatively, maybe ""baba is win"", but then touching anything win would make me win, which isn't useful.

This is getting too convoluted. Let me try to think of the simplest possible move. The key is to the right, so maybe move right step by step, but avoid walls.

Looking at the current position, if I move right, I can go towards the key. But there's a wall at 4 steps right and 3 steps up. Wait, maybe my coordinates are different. Let me try to map it out again.

Assuming the player is at (0,0):

- wall at (2,3)
- rule `key` at (5,3)
- rule `is` at (6,3)
- rule `win` at (7,3)
- rule `wall` at (-3,2)
- rule `is` at (-2,2)
- rule `stop` at (-1,2)
- wall at (2,2)
- ball at (3,2)
- wall at (2,1)
- rule `door` at (4,1)
- wall at (2,0)
- key at (5,0)
- walls further down

So the key is at (5,0), which is directly to the right of the player's position (assuming they start at (0,0)). But there's a wall at (2,0), which is two steps to the right. Wait, no. The key is at (5,0), which is five steps to the right. Between (0,0) and (5,0), there's a wall at (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), and others.

So to get to the key at (5,0), I need to move right past the wall at (2,0). But since wall is stop, I can't. So how?

Maybe the door at (4,1) can be used. If I can open the door with the key, then go through. But to reach the door, I need to move right and up. Let's see:

From (0,0):

- Move right to (1,0): blocked by wall at (2,0)? No, the wall at (2,0) is two steps right. So (1,0) is free.
- Move right to (1,0)
- Then right to (2,0): wall is stop, can't move.
- So need to go around. Maybe up to (1,1). Is there a","

Let's try to figure out what to do here. The active rules are key is win, wall is stop, and baba is you. So, my goal is to get the key, which is also considered a win. But how?

Looking at the objects, the key is 5 steps to the right. But there's a wall right in front of it at 1 step to the right. Wait, the wall is a stop, meaning I can't push past it. But maybe I can move the wall by rearranging the rules. Oh right, I'm Baba, and since ""baba is you,"" I can move other text blocks if they're not stopped.

The key, 'is', and 'win' are all in a row to the right. The rule 'wall' is to the left of that. Maybe if I can change the 'wall is stop' rule, the wall wouldn't block me anymore. Let me check the positions. The 'wall' rule is at 4 steps left and 2 steps up. To get there, I would need to move right and up, but the path might be blocked.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule that makes the key not a stop. If I can make 'key' not stop, then perhaps I can move past the wall. But how? I need to find the 'stop' rule. The 'stop' rule is at 2 steps left and 2 steps up. If I can move that rule away, then the wall's stop property might be removed. But moving the 'stop' rule requires me to be able to move it, which I can do since I'm you (Baba).

So, the plan is: move the 'stop' rule somewhere else. Let's see where. The 'stop' rule is at 2 left, 2 up. If I can move it down or to the side, maybe that would remove the wall's stop property. But how to do that? I need to move the 'stop' text block. Since I'm Baba (you), I can move it if it's not stopped. The current rules say wall is stop, but the 'stop' rule itself isn't a wall, so it can be moved.

So, I should move the 'stop' rule. Let's check the positions. The 'stop' rule is at 2 left, 2 up. If I move it to the right or down. Let's see, possible directions. For example, moving it down one step. But I need to see if there's space. Looking at the map, there's a rule 'door' at 4 steps right and 1 step up, and walls below. Maybe moving the 'stop' rule down to where the 'rule baba' is at 4 left, 3 steps down. But I need to pathfind to get there.

Alternatively, move the 'stop' rule to the right. Let's see. From the current position of 'stop' (2 left, 2 up), moving right would take it to 1 left, 2 up. Is that possible? There's a wall at 1 step right and 2 step up, but that's a wall object, not the 'stop' rule. The 'stop' rule is a separate text block. So maybe I can move it right past the wall. Wait, but can I push the wall? No, because wall is stop. But the 'stop' rule is a text block that's not stopped unless the rule says so. Since 'wall is stop', but the 'stop' rule itself isn't a wall, so it can be moved. So I can move the 'stop' rule right by one step. That would make the wall's stop property come from somewhere else, maybe removing it.

Once the 'stop' rule is moved, the wall might no longer be a stop, allowing me to pass. Then I can go get the key and bring it to the door or wherever the win condition is. But the key is win, so maybe just grabbing the key is enough? The active rule says key is win, so picking up the key should make me win.

So steps: move the 'stop' rule out of the way, then move past the wall to get the key. To move the 'stop' rule, I need to be near it. Current position of 'stop' is 2 steps left and 2 steps up. Where am I? The player (Baba) is at rule `baba` which is 4 steps left and 3 steps down. Wait, no. Looking at the objects, the rule `baba` is at 4 step to the left and 3 steps down. So the player's position is at that rule's location. So to reach the 'stop' rule at 2 left, 2 up, I need to move right and up.

From the player's position (4 left, 3 down), moving right once would get to 3 left, 3 down. Then up to 3 left, 2 down. Then maybe up again? Wait, directions might be a bit confusing. Let me clarify the coordinate system. The observation says objects are positioned relative to the player. For example, ""wall 4 steps to the right and 3 step up"" means the wall is northeast of the player. So the player is at the origin, and positions are relative.

So the player's position is where the rule `baba` is located: 4 steps left and 3 steps down from the player's starting point? Wait, no. The rule `baba` is an object on the map. So the player is represented by the rule `baba` which is 4 steps left and 3 steps down. Wait, that might mean the player is at that position. So the player's location is at (4 left, 3 down). So to get to the 'stop' rule at 2 left, 2 up, the player needs to move northeast.

From (4 left, 3 down) to (2 left, 2 up): the difference is +2 right and +5 up. So the player needs to move right twice and up five times. But along the way, there are walls. Let's see. Moving right from 4 left to 3 left, then 2 left. At 2 left, 3 down, what's there? Looking at the objects: wall 2 steps to the right and 3 steps down. Wait, that's a wall at (2 right, 3 down) relative to the player? This is getting confusing. Maybe I need to visualize the grid.

Alternatively, perhaps the best approach is to move the 'stop' rule to the right. The 'stop' rule is at 2 left, 2 up. If I can move it to the right by one step, to 1 left, 2 up. Then the wall's stop property might be removed. To do that, the player needs to move to the 'stop' rule's location, pick it up, and move it.

So the player is at rule `baba` which is 4 left, 3 down. To reach the 'stop' rule at 2 left, 2 up, the player needs to move right (towards 2 left) and up. Let's calculate the path. From 4 left to 2 left: move right twice. From 3 down to 2 up: move up five steps. But along the way, are there walls blocking?

Looking at the objects:

- At 1 step right and 2 step up: there's a wall.
- At 2 steps right and 2 steps up: a ball.
- At 3 steps right and 2 steps up: another wall.

So moving right from 4 left (player's position) to 2 left would require passing through these obstacles. But since the wall is a stop, the player can't push through. Unless the wall's stop property is removed. Which brings us back to moving the 'stop' rule.

Alternatively, maybe instead of moving the 'stop' rule, create a new rule that makes 'wall' not 'stop'. For example, move the 'wall is stop' rule and replace it with something else. But the 'wall is stop' rule is at 4 left, 2 up. To get there, the player would need to move left and up, but again, blocked by walls.

This is getting complicated. Maybe a simpler approach: since the key is win, and I'm Baba (you), if I can reach the key, then I win. The key is at 5 steps to the right. There's a wall at 1 step to the right. But perhaps the wall is only a stop if the rule 'wall is stop' is active. If I can remove that rule, the wall becomes passable.

To remove 'wall is stop', I need to move the corresponding rule. The 'wall is stop' rule is at 4 left, 2 up. The player needs to move there. From the player's position (4 left, 3 down), moving left once to 5 left, 3 down, then up to 5 left, 2 down, then left again to 6 left, 2 down? Wait, this might not be the right direction. Maybe the coordinates are relative, so moving up from 4 left, 3 down would decrease the down steps. So moving up from 3 down to 2 down, then 1 down, then to 2 up.

This is really confusing without a visual. Let me try to outline the steps again:

1. The goal is to grab the key, which is win.
2. The key is blocked by a wall that's a stop due to 'wall is stop'.
3. To remove the stop property from the wall, either move the 'wall is stop' rule or create a new rule that changes 'wall' to not 'stop'.
4. The 'wall is stop' rule is at 4 left, 2 up. The player is at 4 left, 3 down.
5. To reach the 'wall is stop' rule, the player needs to move left and up, but there might be walls in the way.
6. Alternatively, move the 'stop' rule, which is part of 'wall is stop', to a different location. The 'stop' rule is at 2 left, 2 up.
7. Moving the 'stop' rule to the right would change where stop is applied, possibly removing it from the wall.

Assuming the player can move the 'stop' rule, they can then pass the wall. Let's focus on moving the 'stop' rule.

The 'stop' rule is at 2 left, 2 up. The player is at 4 left, 3 down. To get there, need to move right (towards 2 left) and up.

From 4 left to 2 left: move right twice.

From 3 down to 2 up: move up five times.

But moving right from 4 left to 2 left would require passing through positions 3 left, 3 down; 2 left, 3 down. At 2 left, 3 down, is there an object? Looking at the objects: there's a wall at 2 steps to the right and 3 steps down. Wait, that's the same position as the player's current rule `baba`? No, the player is at rule `baba` which is 4 step to the left and 3 steps down. So moving right once from there would be 3 left, 3 down. Is there a wall there? According to the objects, wall 2 steps to the right and 3 steps down. Wait, maybe the coordinates are relative. If the player is at 4 left, 3 down, then moving right once would be 3 left, 3 down. There's no wall mentioned there. The walls are at 4 steps right and 3 up, etc.

This is getting too tangled. Maybe the best immediate action is to move towards the key, trying to find a path by moving around the walls. But since walls are stop, the player can't push them. Alternatively, perhaps rearrange the rules to make the wall not a stop.

Another angle: since 'key is win', maybe just grabbing the key is enough. So the player needs to reach the key at 5 steps right. To get there, pass through the wall at 1 step right. But how?

If the player can make the wall not a stop, then they can move past it. To do that, they need to modify the 'wall is stop' rule. The 'wall is stop' rule is composed of three text blocks: 'wall', 'is', 'stop', each positioned relative to each other. To delete or move this rule, the player needs to move each of these text blocks.

Alternatively, create a new rule that says 'wall is not stop', but that would require having the text blocks for 'wall', 'is', 'not', 'stop' arranged correctly.

But given the current objects, the player might not have the 'not' text block. Looking at the objects, there's 'key', 'is', 'win', 'wall', 'stop', 'door', 'baba', etc. No 'not' rule present. So creating a negation might not be possible.

Therefore, the feasible option is to move the existing 'stop' rule away. The 'stop' rule is a single text block at 2 left, 2 up. If the player can move this rule, then the 'wall is stop' rule would be broken, making the wall passable.

So the steps would be:

1. Move towards the 'stop' rule at 2 left, 2 up.
2. Once next to it, move it to a new location, say, 1 left, 2 up.
3. Now, the wall's stop property is removed, allowing the player to pass.
4. Then move right past the wall to grab the key.

But to move the 'stop' rule, the player needs to be adjacent to it and move in a direction. The player's current position is at the 'baba' rule, which is 4 left, 3 down. To reach the 'stop' rule at 2 left, 2 up:

- Move right twice (from 4 left to 2 left).
- Move up five times (from 3 down to 2 up).

But along the way, are there obstacles? Let's check:

- Moving right from 4 left to 3 left: is there anything there? According to the objects, at 1 step right and 2 step up, there's a wall. Wait, maybe my coordinate system is off. Let me try to map it out.

Alternatively, perhaps the best action is to move right towards the key, hoping that once the 'stop' rule is moved, the path is clear. But without moving the 'stop' rule first, the wall blocks the way.

Given the time constraints, the next immediate action should be to move towards the 'stop' rule to modify it. So the first move would be to go right to reach the 'stop' rule's location.

But the player's current position is 4 left, 3 down. To get to 2 left, 2 up, they need to move right and up. The immediate direction to move right would be 'right' action. So the first action is 'right' to move closer to the 'stop' rule.

Let's try to figure out what to do here. The active rules are key is win, wall is stop, and baba is you. So, the goal is to get the key because key is win. But how?

Looking at the objects on the map, the key is at 5 steps to the right. But there are walls blocking the path. The wall to the right and 3 steps up seems like a barrier. Also, there's a rule that wall is stop, so I can't move through walls. 

Wait, I'm Baba, right? Because baba is you. So maybe I can move around the walls. Let me check the positions. The key is at 5 steps right. The current position of Baba is at rule `baba` which is 4 steps left and 3 steps down from the reference point. Hmm, maybe I need to move towards the key. 

Looking at the map, there's a wall at 1 step right and 3 steps up. Then rule `key` is 4 steps right and 3 steps up. So, the path to the key is blocked by walls. But perhaps there's a way to rearrange the rules? 

The rules are in the format [Subject] IS [Property]. The existing rules are key is win, wall is stop, and baba is you. If I can change these rules, maybe I can make the walls not stop, or make myself able to pass through them. 

For example, if I can change ""wall is stop"" to something else, like ""wall is move"", then walls wouldn't block me. But how do I do that? To change a rule, I need to move the text blocks that form the rule. The ""wall is stop"" rule is made up of the rule `wall`, rule `is`, and rule `stop`. If I can move these text blocks to create a new rule that negates ""wall is stop"", that might work. 

But wait, the problem is that I can only move objects or text that are not defined as ""STOP"" or similar immovable properties. The current rules have wall as stop, so maybe moving text blocks like ""is"" or ""stop"" is allowed if the text blocks themselves aren't stopped. But I need to confirm. 

Looking at the tips, it says you can only move objects or text that are not defined as ""STOP"" or similar. So, if a text block is part of a rule that makes it stop, can I still move it? For example, the ""stop"" text block is part of the ""wall is stop"" rule. If I move the ""stop"" text block, does that break the rule? 

Yes, moving the ""stop"" text block would remove it from the ""wall is stop"" rule, effectively changing the rule to ""wall is"" (incomplete) and ""stop"" is now a separate text block. That might be a way to remove the stop property from walls. 

So the plan is: move the ""stop"" text block away from the ""wall is stop"" rule. That would make walls no longer stop. Then I can walk through the walls and grab the key. 

Looking at the current positions, the ""stop"" rule is at 1 step left and 2 step up. The ""wall is stop"" rule is composed of rule `wall` at 4 step left and 2 step up, rule `is` at 3 step left and 2 step up, and rule `stop` at 2 step left and 2 step up. To break this rule, I need to move one of these components. 

If I move the ""stop"" text block, say, to the right, then the ""wall is stop"" rule would be incomplete, and walls would no longer be stop. Then I can move through the walls. 

From the observation, the ""stop"" rule is at 1 step left and 2 step up. To move it, I need to determine the direction. The available actions are up, down, left, right, or idle. 

If I move right from the ""stop"" position, that would be 0 step left and 2 step up. But I need to check if that's possible. However, the problem is that moving the ""stop"" text block might require being adjacent to it. 

Assuming I am at the position of the Baba entity, which is at rule `baba` located 4 steps left and 3 steps down. So my current position is 4 left, 3 down from the reference point. The ""stop"" text block is at 1 step left and 2 step up. To get to the ""stop"" block, I need to move from my current position to there. 

The distance between me (4 left, 3 down) and the ""stop"" block (1 left, 2 up) is: left difference is 4 -1 =3 steps to the right, and down difference is 3 - (-2) =5 steps up? Wait, maybe the coordinates are a bit confusing. Let me clarify. 

The positions are described relative to the reference point, which I assume is the starting point. The Baba's position is 4 steps left and 3 steps down. The ""stop"" block is 1 step left and 2 step up. So to move from Baba's position to the ""stop"" block, I need to move right 3 steps and up 2 steps. 

But each action is a single step in one direction. So first, I need to move right three times to get from 4 left to 1 left, and then up two times to reach 2 step up. 

However, the problem is that there might be walls in the way. For example, moving right from the initial position (4 left) to 3 left, then 2 left, then 1 left. But are there walls blocking that path? Looking at the map, the walls are at specific positions. For example, wall 4 steps to the right and 3 step up, but that's in a different area. 

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to first move up to reach the ""stop"" block's area. But the key is to reach the ""stop"" text block and move it. 

Once the ""stop"" text block is moved, walls no longer block, allowing path to the key. Then, grab the key (which is win) and possibly move to the door or whatever. 

But the immediate action needed is to either move towards the ""stop"" block or find another way. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a different rule to change. For example, if I can make ""key is win"" into ""baba is win"", then touching the key would make me win. But to do that, I need to move the text blocks of the existing rules. 

The current ""key is win"" rule is at 5 steps right and 3 step up (rule `key`), 6 steps right (rule `is`), and 7 steps right (rule `win`). To change this to ""baba is win"", I need to move the ""key"" and ""win"" text blocks to form ""baba is win"". 

But that would require rearranging multiple text blocks, which might be complex. Plus, moving them could be blocked by walls. 

Alternatively, if I can make ""baba is win"", then I don't need to pick up the key; just being Baba would make me win. But how? 

To do that, I need to create the rule ""baba is win"". The existing ""baba"" rule is at 4 step left and 3 steps down (rule `baba`). So, I need to take the ""win"" text block (7 steps right, 3 step up) and move it next to ""baba"" and ""is"". 

But again, movement might be blocked. 

Alternatively, maybe the door is the win condition, but the active rule says key is win. However, the door is at 4 steps right and 1 step up, guarded by a wall. 

So, the most feasible plan is to remove the ""stop"" property from walls by moving the ""stop"" text block. Then, move through the walls to reach the key. 

To do that, I need to navigate to the ""stop"" text block at 1 step left and 2 step up. From Baba's position (4 left, 3 down), moving right 3 steps and up 2 steps. 

But each move is a single step. So first, move right three times: right, right, right. Then move up two times: up, up. 

But along the way, are there any walls? Let's check the map. 

Looking at the objects:

- Wall at 2 steps to the right and 3 step up: that's not in the path.
- Wall at 1 step right and 2 step up: that's the position of the ""stop"" text block's area. Wait, no, the ""stop"" text block is at 1 step left and 2 step up. So moving right from Baba's position (4 left, 3 down) to 1 left (which is 3 steps right), then up to 2 step up. 

Assuming there are no walls blocking that direct path, then it's possible. 

Once the ""stop"" text block is moved, say, to the right next to the ""is"" rule (which is at 3 step left and 2 step up), then the ""wall is stop"" rule is broken. 

So the sequence would be:

1. Move right three times to reach the ""stop"" text block's position (1 left, 2 up).
2. Move the ""stop"" text block to a new position, say, to the right, making it 0 left and 2 up.
3. Now, walls are no longer stop, so can move through them.
4. Navigate to the key at 5 steps right, avoiding walls since they don't stop now.
5. Pick up the key, which is win.

But the immediate action needed is the first step: moving right to reach the ""stop"" block. 

However, the problem is that the assistant's previous actions kept getting marked as invalid. Maybe the way the positions are calculated is different. 

Alternatively, maybe the key is already win, so touching it would make me win. But the rule says key is win, so picking up the key would make it so that key is win, but I need to be the one to touch it. 

But since I'm Baba and ""baba is you"", if I touch the key, does that apply the ""win"" rule to me? The rule is ""key is win"", so maybe touching the key makes it win, but I need to be the one to win. 

Alternatively, maybe the win condition is to be in the same position as the key, since key is win. So if I can reach the key, I win. 

But the path is blocked by walls. So the only way is to remove the stop property from walls. 

Therefore, the correct action is to move towards the ""stop"" text block and then move it. 

But the assistant needs to choose an action (up, down, left, right, or idle) based on the current observation. 

Looking at the latest observation, the key is at 6 steps right and 3 step up. The ""stop"" text block is at 1 step left and 2 step up. Baba's position is at rule `baba` which is 4 step left and 3 steps down. 

So from Baba's position to reach the ""stop"" block, the direction is right (to decrease the left steps) and up. 

Specifically, Baba is at 4 left, 3 down. The ""stop"" block is at 1 left, 2 up. 

So the difference in left is 4 -1 =3 steps to the right. The difference in down is 3 - (-2) =5 steps up. 

But each action is a single step. So the first move should be right to get closer. 

Therefore, the correct action is to move right.

Let's see. The active rules are key is win, wall is stop, and baba is you. The goal is probably to get the key to be the win, but the key is already labeled as win. However, there's a ball nearby at position 2 steps to the right and 2 steps up. The player (Baba) is at rule `baba` which is 4 steps to the left and 3 steps down. So, I need to figure out how to reach the key or the door.

First, check if I can move towards the key. The key is at 5 steps to the right. But the path might be blocked by walls. Let me look at the map. From the current position of Baba (rule `baba` at 4 left, 3 down), moving right would approach the key. But between Baba and the key, there's a wall at 1 step right and 3 up, then rules and other walls. Wait, the wall is at 1 step right and 3 up. So if I move right, I might hit a stop wall. The active rule says wall is stop, so I can't move through them. So moving directly right isn't possible.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to rearrange the rules. The key is part of the ""key is win"" rule. If I can break that rule, maybe I can change what's win. But how? To break a rule, I need to move the text blocks. The ""key is win"" rule is at 4,3 up. The components are rule `key`, rule `is`, rule `win` all in a row. To break it, I might need to move one of these. But can I move them? The rules say that only objects not defined as stop can be moved. Wall is stop, but the rules themselves—are they stop? The active rules are key is win, wall is stop, baba is you. So 'rule' as an object—does it have a property? Not directly. But since wall is stop, maybe any object that's a wall is stop. The rules are on the map as separate objects. For example, the rule `key` is an object. Are those considered stop? Since wall is stop, but other objects like rule blocks might not be. So perhaps I can move the rule blocks.

If I can move the ""key is win"" rule, maybe I can change it to something else. For example, making Baba the win. But how? Let's see. The player is Baba, and the rule `baba is you` is present. So if I can create a ""baba is win"" rule, that would make reaching Baba (myself) the win condition. To do that, I need to move the 'baba', 'is', and 'win' text blocks. The 'win' is already part of the ""key is win"" rule. So maybe I can take the 'win' block and put it with 'baba' and 'is' to form ""baba is win"".

But first, I need to navigate to those text blocks. The current position of Baba is at rule `baba` which is 4 steps left and 3 steps down from the reference point (probably the key area). The 'win' block is 6 steps right and 3 steps up. So moving in that direction might be blocked by walls. Alternatively, maybe there's a path using other rules.

Looking at the objects again: the key is at 5 steps right, and there's a door at 4 steps right and 1 step up. The door might be a way out if I can reach it. But the door is behind a wall at 2 steps right and 2 steps up. So maybe I need to remove the wall rule. The ""wall is stop"" rule is at 2 steps left and 2 steps up. If I can break that rule, then the wall would no longer be stop, allowing traversal. To break it, I need to move the 'wall', 'is', or 'stop' blocks in that rule. The 'wall' rule is at 4 steps left and 2 steps up, 'is' at 3 steps left and 2 steps up, 'stop' at 2 steps left and 2 steps up.

So, if I can move the 'stop' block from the ""wall is stop"" rule, perhaps I can make the wall not stop. Let's see. The 'stop' block is at 2 steps left and 2 steps up. If I can move that block elsewhere, the ""wall is stop"" rule would be broken, and walls wouldn't be stop anymore. Then I could walk through walls, which might help in reaching the door or rearranging other rules.

But how to move the 'stop' block? I need to be adjacent to it and move it in a direction. Let's check Baba's current position. The rule `baba` is at 4 steps left and 3 steps down. To reach the 'stop' block at 2 steps left and 2 steps up, I need to move up and right. Let's calculate the steps needed. From current position (4 left, 3 down), to reach 2 left and 2 up: move up once, right twice. But the path might be blocked. Moving up from current position: the wall is at 1 step right and 3 up, but that's further right. Wait, the current position is rule `baba` which is 4 steps left and 3 steps down. So the actual coordinates might be relative. Maybe the reference point is the key area. This is getting a bit confusing. Alternatively, maybe the best approach is to move towards the 'stop' block to break the ""wall is stop"" rule.

Alternatively, since the key is already set as win, maybe grabbing the key allows you to win. But the key is at 5 steps right, and there's a wall in the way. The wall at 1 step right and 3 up is a problem. If walls are stop, I can't pass through. So unless I can remove the wall's stop property, I can't get past. So breaking the ""wall is stop"" rule seems necessary.

To do that, I need to move the 'stop' text block. Let's see where the 'stop' block is located. From the objects list: rule `stop` is 1 step to the left and 2 step up. So relative to the current position (rule `baba` at 4 left, 3 down), the 'stop' block is at (4 left -1 left) = 3 left, and (3 down -2 up) = 1 down. So position: 3 left, 1 down. To move from current position (4 left, 3 down) to 3 left, 1 down: move left once and up twice. But the path: moving left from 4 left to 3 left is okay. Then moving up twice from 3 down to 1 down. Is there any wall in between? The wall at 1 step right and 3 up is not in the way here. The walls are at specific positions, so maybe the path is clear. Once I reach the 'stop' block, I can move it somewhere else, say to the right, to break the ""wall is stop"" rule.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule that makes 'stop' something else, but that might be more complex. Breaking the existing rule by moving its components seems easier.

So the plan is: move towards the 'stop' block at 3 left, 1 down, pick it up, and move it to a different location to deactivate the ""wall is stop"" rule. Once walls are no longer stop, I can walk through them and reach the key or door.

But how to move the 'stop' block? I need to be adjacent to it. From the current position (4 left, 3 down), moving left once to 3 left, 3 down. Then up once to 3 left, 2 down. Then up again to 3 left, 1 down, which is where the 'stop' block is. Once there, I can move it. The action would be 'up' twice to reach it, then 'right' or another direction to move the 'stop' block away.

But the user is asking for a single action. The previous attempts were 'right' multiple times, but that didn't work. Maybe the correct action now is to move up to get closer to the 'stop' block. Alternatively, check if the 'stop' block is adjacent.

Wait, the current position of Baba is at rule `baba` which is 4 steps left and 3 steps down. The 'stop' block is 1 step to the left and 2 steps up. So relative positions: left 1, up 2. So from Baba's position, to reach 'stop', he needs to move left once and up twice. But each move is one step. So first action could be 'left' to get to 3 left, 3 down. Then 'up' to 3 left, 2 down. Then 'up' again to 3 left, 1 down, where 'stop' is. Once there, the next action could be to move 'stop' block, but the problem is that the user is asking for a single action. So maybe the first step is to move 'left' to get closer.

But looking at the latest observation, after several 'right' actions, the position of the key might have changed? Or perhaps the key is still at 5 steps right. Alternatively, maybe the correct action is to move towards the 'win' rule to change it. But the 'win' rule is part of the ""key is win"" rule. To change that, I need to move the 'win' block.

Alternatively, since the key is already win, maybe grabbing the key allows victory. But to grab it, I need to be on the same tile as the key. The key is at 5 steps right. The player is at rule `baba` which is 4 steps left and 3 steps down. So the distance to the key is quite far, and likely blocked by walls.

Another approach: the ball is at 2 steps right and 2 steps up. If I can move the ball, maybe that helps, but the active rules don't mention ball properties. Unless I can create a rule like ""ball is win"", but that would require moving the necessary text blocks.

But the main issue is the walls being stop. So breaking ""wall is stop"" is crucial. Therefore, the immediate action should be to move towards the 'stop' block to deactivate it.

Given that, the next action should be 'up' to move towards the 'stop' block. Alternatively, 'left' if needed. Let me check the coordinates again.

Current position: rule `baba` at 4 step left and 3 step down.

'stop' block is at 1 step left and 2 step up.

So from current position (4L, 3D), to reach 'stop' which is at (1L, 2U), the path is left 3 steps and up 5 steps. But that's too far. Wait, maybe the coordinates are relative to the key area. Alternatively, perhaps the direction is different. Maybe the 'stop' block is to the left and up from Baba's current position.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct move is to 'left' to get closer. But without knowing the exact map layout, it's challenging. However, based on the previous actions where moving 'right' didn't work, maybe the correct direction is 'up' to avoid walls.

In the last few steps, the assistant kept trying 'right', but the observations show that the key is moving further right each time, indicating that moving right isn't the solution. Instead, the key's position is changing, perhaps because the rules are being manipulated. Therefore, maybe the correct approach is to focus on breaking the ""wall is stop"" rule by moving the 'stop' block.

Thus, the next action should be to move up towards the 'stop' block. But how to determine the exact direction? The 'stop' block is 1 step to the left and 2 steps up from Baba's position. So from Baba's current position (4L, 3D), moving left once to 3L, 3D, then up twice to 3L, 1D. The first action would be 'left', then 'up' twice. But since we can only output one action, the first step is 'left' to get closer.

Wait, but the previous observations show that after moving right, the key's position changes. Maybe the key is part of a movable rule. If the ""key is win"" rule is movable, then moving the key block could change its position. But the goal is to have the key be win, which it already is. So maybe the issue is accessing the key.

Alternatively, perhaps the door at 4 steps right and 1 step up is the exit. To reach it, need to pass through the wall at 2 steps right and 2 steps up. If we can make walls not stop, then we can walk through them. So breaking ""wall is stop"" is essential.

Therefore, the priority is to reach the 'stop' block and move it. The first action is to move towards it. Given the current position, the direction to 'stop' is left and up. So the action could be 'left' to move left once, then 'up' to move up. But again, only one action is allowed. So the best single action is to move 'left' to get closer to the 'stop' block.

Let's try to figure out what to do here. The active rules are ""key is win"", ""wall is stop"", and ""baba is you"". So, normally, the goal is to get the key to become a win, but according to the rules, the key is already win. Maybe I need to reach the key? Or perhaps there's another interpretation.

Looking at the objects, there's a key positioned at 6 steps to the right. But there's a wall at 5 steps to the right and 1 step up, which might be blocking the path. Also, there's a ball at 3 steps to the right and 2 steps up, but I'm not sure if that's relevant. The door is at 5 steps to the right and 1 step up, which might be the exit once the key is obtained.

Since I'm controlled by ""baba is you"", I can move around unless there's a STOP rule. The walls are STOP, so I need to navigate around them. The key is the WIN object because of the rule, so getting to the key should solve the level. But how to get there?

Looking at the current position, I might be at the starting point. To reach the key at 6 steps right, I need to move right multiple times. However, there's a wall at 5 steps right and 1 step up, which could be a barrier. But maybe there's a way around. Wait, the door is at 5 steps right and 1 step up. If I can push the door or maybe change the rules to remove the STOP from the wall.

But first, let's check if I can move right. The key is 6 steps right, and the path might be blocked by walls. Let me see the objects again. At 2 steps right and 3 steps up is a wall, then rule key at 5 steps right and 3 up. Wait, maybe the layout is such that moving right incrementally is possible, avoiding the walls.

Alternatively, maybe I need to rewrite the rules. For example, if I can make ""key is not stop"" or change the STOP rule. But to do that, I need to move the text blocks. The rule ""wall is stop"" is at 3 steps left and 2 steps up. If I can move that rule away or replace it, then walls wouldn't be stop anymore, allowing me to walk through them.

But moving text blocks requires that they aren't defined as STOP. Currently, the STOP rule is active, but the text blocks themselves might not be STOP unless specified. Wait, the rule ""stop"" is a property. The objects that are STOP are the walls. So the text blocks like ""wall is stop"" are rules, not objects with STOP property. So maybe I can move those rules.

For instance, if I move the ""wall is stop"" rule, then walls wouldn't be stop anymore. Then I could walk through them. Let's see where the ""wall is stop"" rule is located. It's at 3 steps left and 2 steps up. To reach there, I might need to move left and up, but I have to check if that's possible.

Alternatively, if I can make myself a WIN by creating a new rule like ""baba is win"". But to do that, I need to move the ""win"" rule or combine it with ""baba"" and ""is"". The ""win"" rule is at 7 steps right and 3 steps up. So if I can move the ""is"" rule (at 6 steps right and 3 steps up) next to ""baba"" and ""win"", then I could create ""baba is win"".

But first, I need to navigate to where those text blocks are. Let's map out the positions:

- The ""key is win"" rule is at 5,6,7 steps right and 3 up.
- ""wall is stop"" is at 3 left and 2 up.
- ""stop"" rule is at 2 left and 2 up.
- ""baba is you"" is at 3 left and 3 down, etc.

Maybe the strategy is to move the ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" and ""win"" to create a new rule. For example, if I can position ""baba"", ""is"", and ""win"" in a line, then ""baba is win"" would become active, making me win. That could be a solution.

But how to get there? The player (Baba) is at a certain position. Looking at the objects, there's a rule `baba` at 3 left and 3 down, along with `is` and `you`. So maybe the player is near there. If I can move those rules to form ""baba is win"", that would work.

Alternatively, if I can make the key a you, then grabbing the key would make me you. But the rule is ""key is win"", so changing that to ""key is you"" might help. But need to move the ""is"" and ""you"" rules accordingly.

This is getting complicated. Let me try to prioritize. The immediate goal is to reach the key, which is WIN. But the path might be blocked by walls. If I can remove the STOP property from walls, that would help. To do that, I need to move the ""wall is stop"" rule. Let's see where that rule is. It's at 3 steps left and 2 steps up. To get there, I need to move left and up, but I have to check if there are any STOP objects in the way.

The walls are at various positions, but if walls are STOP, I can't walk through them. So moving left from the current position (assuming I'm at 0,0) to 3 left and 2 up might require stepping over walls. Wait, the rule ""wall is stop"" is a text block, not a wall object. So maybe I can move that rule even if there are walls nearby, as long as the text blocks aren't themselves STOP objects.

Wait, the STOP property applies to objects like walls. The text blocks themselves have their own positions but aren't necessarily STOP unless they're part of a rule that makes them so. For example, if there was a rule ""rule is stop"", then text blocks would be stop. But currently, the only STOP objects are walls. So perhaps I can move the ""wall is stop"" rule by pushing it, since it's not a STOP object itself.

Assuming that, I could move the ""wall is stop"" rule to a different position, thereby changing the rules. For example, moving it far away so that the rule is no longer active. Then walls would no longer be stop, allowing me to walk through them.

So the steps would be:

1. Navigate to the ""wall is stop"" rule located at 3 left and 2 up.
2. Move left and up to reach that position.
3. Once there, move the rule to a different location, say, by pushing it right or down, removing its effect.

But how to move the rule? To move a text block, I need to be adjacent to it and move in a direction, which would push it if it's not STOP. Since the text blocks themselves aren't STOP (unless specified), I can move them.

So first, determine the player's current position. Looking at the objects, there's a rule `baba` at 3 left and 3 down. That's probably where the player is, as ""baba is you"" makes the player controlled by Baba. So the player's position is at 3 left and 3 down.

To reach the ""wall is stop"" rule at 3 left and 2 up, the player needs to move up once. From 3 left, 3 down to 3 left, 2 down (which is 2 up from the original position). Then move up again to reach 3 left, 1 down, but wait, the ""wall is stop"" rule is at 3 step to the left and 2 step up. Wait, the coordinates might be a bit confusing. Let me parse the positions correctly.

The observation lists objects with their positions relative to the player. For example, ""wall 2 steps to the right and 3 step up"" means that wall is 2 steps east and 3 steps north from the player's current position.

The ""wall is stop"" rule is at ""3 step to the left and 2 step up"". So that's 3 steps west and 2 steps north from the player. The player is at 0,0 (presumably). So to get there, the player needs to move left 3 times and up 2 times.

But along the way, are there any STOP objects (walls) that block the path? Let's check the objects:

- Looking at the objects listed, there's a wall at 2 steps right and 3 up, but that's not on the direct path to 3 left and 2 up.
- The walls are at various positions, but the path west and north might be clear. For example, moving left from the player's position (0,0) to 3 left (west) would pass through positions (-1,0), (-2,0), (-3,0). Are there walls there? Checking the objects:

Looking at the listed objects:

- wall 2 steps right and 3 up
- wall 3 steps to the right and 2 up
- wall 2 steps to the right and 1 up
- wall at 1 step right
- etc.

So moving west (left) from the player's position, there are no walls in the way until maybe further left. The closest walls to the left are at 3 step to the left and 2 step up (the ""wall is stop"" rule's position is 3 left and 2 up, which is a text block, not a wall object). Wait, the objects listed include ""rule `wall` 3 step to the left and 2 step up"", which is a text block defining the rule, not a wall object. The actual wall objects are at other positions.

So perhaps the path to 3 left and 2 up is clear. Once the player reaches there, they can move the ""wall is stop"" rule by pushing it. For example, moving up while adjacent to it would push it further up, removing the rule.

Alternatively, moving the ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" and ""you"" to create a new rule. The ""you"" rule is at 1 step left and 3 steps down. The ""baba"" rule is at 3 left and 3 down. The ""is"" rule is at 2 left and 3 down. So if the player can move these together, they could form ""baba is you"" again, but that's already active. Maybe to form ""baba is win"", which would make the player win.

The ""win"" rule is at 7 steps right and 3 up. That's quite far. To get there, the player would need to move right multiple times, but there are walls blocking the path. For example, at 5 steps right and 1 up is a wall, and the door is there. Maybe the door is unlocked, but the rule is ""key is win"", so maybe having the key makes the door accessible.

Alternatively, if the player can push the door using the key. But the key is at 6 steps right. If the player retrieves the key, then maybe the door can be opened by moving it with the key. But how?

Alternatively, if the player changes the rule ""key is win"" to ""key is door"", then the key could open the door. But that requires rearranging the text blocks.

This is getting quite complex. Let's try to break it down step by step.

Current active rules:
- key is win: So the key is the win object. Therefore, reaching the key should solve the level.
- wall is stop: Walls block movement.
- baba is you: The player is Baba.

Objects on the map:
- Key at 6 right.
- Door at 5 right and 1 up.
- Walls at various positions.

The challenge is to reach the key at 6 right, but the path is blocked by walls. For example, between the player and the key, there's a wall at 5 right and 1 up (the door's position?), and other walls.

If I can remove the STOP property from walls, then I can walk through them. To do that, I need to move the ""wall is stop"" rule. The rule is located at 3 left and 2 up. So the player needs to move there.

Player's current position is where the ""baba"" rule is: 3 left and 3 down. To reach 3 left and 2 up, the player needs to move up once (from 3 left, 3 down to 3 left, 2 down, which is 2 up from the original position? Wait, coordinate systems can be confusing. Assuming that ""up"" increases the y-coordinate and ""right"" increases the x-coordinate.

So the player is at (0,0). The ""wall is stop"" rule is at (-3, 2). The player needs to move west (left) 3 times and north (up) 2 times to reach there.

But moving west 3 steps from (0,0) to (-3,0). Are there any walls along that path? Looking at the objects:

- The walls listed are at various positions, but none directly in the west path from (0,0) to (-3,0). For example, there's a wall at 2 steps right and 3 up (which is (2,3)), but that's east and north. The closest walls to the west are at 4 steps left and 3 steps down (rule `baba` is there), but that's part of the text block.

So the path to (-3, 2) should be clear. Once the player reaches (-3, 2), they can move the ""wall is stop"" rule. For example, moving north from there would push the rule further north, removing the ""wall is stop"" rule. Then walls wouldn't be stop anymore, allowing the player to walk through them.

After removing that rule, the player can move through walls and reach the key at (6,0). The path from (0,0) to (6,0) would have walls at various points, but since walls are no longer stop, the player can walk around them or through them.

Alternatively, once walls aren't stop, the player can go directly right to (6,0) to grab the key, which is the win object.

So the steps would be:

1. Move left 3 times and up 2 times to reach the ""wall is stop"" rule.
2. Move the rule away (e.g., up or down) to remove its effect.
3. Move right to reach the key.

But how to execute these steps given the observations and possible actions?

The immediate action needed is to start moving towards the ""wall is stop"" rule. From the current position (assuming player is at (0,0)), moving left (west) once would take them to (-1,0). Next left to (-2,0), then (-3,0). Then up twice to reach (-3,2).

But each move requires checking if the path is clear. Since the player is Baba and ""baba is you"", and assuming that text blocks aren't stop unless specified, the player can move freely through non-STOP objects (like other text blocks).

So the first action should be to move left to start heading towards the ""wall is stop"" rule.

Let's see what's going on here. I need to figure out the next move in this Baba Is You level. The active rules are ""key is win"", ""wall is stop"", and ""baba is you"". So, the goal is to get the key, which is acting as the win condition. But there's a door blocking the way, and walls are stoppable.

Looking at the objects on the map, the key is way to the right, at 7 steps right. But between me and the key, there's a wall at 3 steps right. Wait, no—the player (Baba) is probably at the rule `baba` block, which is 2 steps left and 3 steps down from the wall. So, my position isn't directly clear. Let me parse the objects again.

The rule `baba` is at 2 steps left and 3 steps down from a wall. So if that wall is at position (0,0), then Baba is at (-2, -3). But I'm not sure about the coordinate system here. The key is at 7 steps right, which would be (7,0) if up is positive y. The door is at 5 steps right and 1 step up, which is (5,1). The ball is at (3,2), which might be a distractor.

The active rules mean that picking up the key makes me win. So I need to get to the key. But the path to the key (to the right) is blocked by walls at each step. The wall at 3 steps right is a stop, so I can't push it unless I change a rule. Since I'm Baba, and ""baba is you"", I can move. But to move past the walls, I need to either move them or make them not stop.

Looking at the text blocks, there's a ""rule `stop` 2 step up"". If I can move that rule somewhere else, maybe I can remove the stop property from walls. Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule that makes walls passable. But how?

Wait, the key is at 7 steps right, and it's defined as win. So if I can reach the key, I win. But the walls are in the way. The walls are also defined as stop, so I can't go through them. The ball is there, but I don't know if it's useful.

Another approach: The ""rule `door` 5 steps to the right and 1 step up"" might be a way to exit, but I don't know how the door works. Maybe the door is a new object that can be opened with the key? But the active rules don't mention door properties. The key is win, so maybe picking up the key makes me win regardless of the door.

Wait, the key is win, so if I touch the key, I win. So the problem is getting to the key. The walls are stop, so I can't go through them. The only way is to move the walls or change their property.

Looking at the text blocks, there's a ""rule `wall` 2 step to the left and 2 step up"". Maybe if I can move that rule, I can change what a wall is. For example, if I make wall become something else, then the existing walls might not block me.

Alternatively, if I can create a new rule like ""key is push"" or ""baba is push"", maybe I can push the walls. But to do that, I need to manipulate the text blocks.

But how do I move the text blocks? The rules say that only objects not defined as stop can be moved. Since I'm Baba (you), and the text blocks like ""key"", ""is"", ""win"", etc., are they stoppable? The active rules are wall is stop, so unless a text block is a wall, it can be moved. Let's check:

The text blocks present are:

- rule `key` at 5 steps right and 3 up
- rule `is` at 6 steps right and 3 up
- rule `win` at 7 steps right and 3 up
- rule `wall` at 2 left and 2 up
- rule `is` at 1 left and 2 up
- rule `stop` at 1 left and 2 up (same as previous)
- door at 5 steps right and 1 up

So the text blocks like ""key"", ""is"", ""win"", ""wall"", ""stop"", and ""door"" are all rules. Since ""wall is stop"", but these text blocks themselves might not be walls unless they are part of a wall rule. For example, the rule `wall` is a text block that defines what a wall is. So unless the text block itself is a wall object, it's not stopped. But since the rules are separate from the objects, maybe the text blocks can be moved as long as they are not part of a stop rule.

Wait, the objects on the map include the rules. For example, ""rule `key` 5 steps to the right..."" is an object. So those are movable unless they are defined as stop. But the active rule is ""wall is stop"", so any object that is a wall is stop. However, the text blocks like ""key"" or ""is"" are rules, not walls unless they are part of a wall's definition.

This is getting a bit confusing. Let's recap:

- I am Baba (you), so I can move.
- Walls are stop, so I can't move through them.
- The key is win, so touching it wins.
- The key is located far to the right, behind several walls.
- There are text blocks that can be moved to change rules.

To move the walls, I need to change their definition. The current rule is ""wall is stop"". If I can change ""wall is stop"" to something else, like ""wall is push"" or remove the ""stop"" property, then the walls wouldn't block me.

Looking at the text blocks, there's a ""rule `stop` 2 step up"". If I can move that rule away, then maybe the wall's stop property is removed. Alternatively, I could create a new rule that says ""stop is nothing"" or similar.

But how to do that? Let's see the available text blocks:

At 2 step left and 2 step up: rule `wall` 3 step to the left and 2 step up? Wait, no. The objects list includes:

- rule `wall` 3 step to the left and 2 step up
- rule `is` 2 step to the left and 2 step up
- rule `stop` 1 step to the left and 2 step up

So these are three text blocks stacked vertically to the left of the main area. The player (Baba) is at rule `baba` 2 step left and 3 steps down, which is probably near the bottom-left area.

To reach the key, I need to get past the walls to the right. The walls are at 3 steps right, 2 steps right, etc. The key is at 7 steps right. So the path is blocked by walls at each rightward step.

To move the walls, I need to alter their definition. The rule that defines wall as stop is ""wall is stop"". That rule is likely part of the text blocks on the left. Specifically, there's a rule `wall` at 3 left and 2 up, followed by rule `is` at 2 left and 2 up, then rule `stop` at 1 left and 2 up. Putting those together, it forms ""wall is stop"".

So if I can move those three text blocks (wall, is, stop) apart, I can break the ""wall is stop"" rule. Then walls would no longer be stop, and I could move through them.

Alternatively, I could create a new rule that says ""stop is win"" or something, but that might not help.

So the plan is: move the ""wall is stop"" rule so that it's no longer a complete rule. To do that, I need to separate the ""wall"", ""is"", and ""stop"" text blocks.

Looking at the current positions:

- rule `wall` is at 3 left, 2 up
- rule `is` is at 2 left, 2 up
- rule `stop` is at 1 left, 2 up

They are all in the same vertical line, 1 step apart to the left. To break the ""wall is stop"" rule, I need to move one of these blocks away. For example, move the ""stop"" rule down or to the side, so that the ""wall is"" is no longer followed by ""stop"".

But how to move these blocks? Since I'm Baba (you), and assuming that text blocks are not stopped unless they are part of a stop object. The only stop objects are the walls. But the text blocks themselves are rules, not walls unless they are part of a wall's definition.

Wait, the rule `wall` defines what a wall is. So if a object is a wall, it's stopped. But the text blocks like ""wall"" are just rules unless they are placed as part of a rule.

This is a bit confusing. Let's think differently. The rules are formed by three adjacent text blocks: [Subject] IS [Property]. So ""wall is stop"" is made by the three blocks: wall, is, stop placed next to each other.

To deactivate this rule, I need to break that trio. So if I move the ""stop"" block away from the ""wall is"" sequence, the rule is no longer active.

Similarly, the current active rules are:

- key is win: formed by key, is, win
- wall is stop: formed by wall, is, stop
- baba is you: formed by baba, is, you

So to change a rule, I need to disrupt one of these triplets.

The key is at 5 right, 3 up; is at 6 right, 3 up; win at 7 right, 3 up. So that's the ""key is win"" rule.

The wall rule is at 3 left, 2 up (wall), 2 left, 2 up (is), 1 left, 2 up (stop). So those three make ""wall is stop"".

The baba rule is at 2 left, 3 down (baba), 1 left, 3 down (is), 3 down (you). So ""baba is you"".

To make progress, I need to either:

1. Move the ""stop"" block away from the wall/is sequence, removing the ""wall is stop"" rule. Then walls would not be stop, and I could move through them.

2. Create a new rule that allows me to pass through walls or moves the walls.

3. Use the key to win without picking it up, but the rule says key is win, so touching it is necessary.

Option 1 seems viable. To do that, I need to move the ""stop"" rule (which is at 1 left, 2 up) somewhere else. But how? To move a text block, I need to be adjacent to it and move in a direction that carries me and the block with me, provided that the block is not stopped.

Since the ""stop"" block is part of the ""wall is stop"" rule, but once moved, the rule is broken. The question is, can I move the ""stop"" block?

The blocks that are stop are the walls. The text blocks themselves are not walls unless they are part of a wall's definition. So the ""stop"" block is just a text block; it's not a wall. Therefore, it can be moved, as long as I'm not moving through a stop object (wall).

So, if I can get to the ""stop"" block at 1 left, 2 up, and move it, say, down or right, then the ""wall is stop"" rule is broken, making walls passable.

But how to reach that ""stop"" block? The player (Baba) is at rule `baba` which is 2 left and 3 down. So relative positions:

- The ""stop"" block is at 1 left, 2 up. From Baba's position, that's 1 step to the right (since Baba is 2 left, moving right to 1 left) and 5 steps up (from 3 down to 2 up). That's quite a distance. There are walls blocking the way.

Looking at the map, between Baba and the ""stop"" block, there are walls to the right and above. For example, at 3 steps right and 3 up is a wall. So moving right directly isn't possible due to the wall at 3 right, 3 up.

Alternative approach: Maybe push a wall. If I can make walls pushable, then I can push them out of the way. To do that, I need to change the ""wall is stop"" rule to ""wall is push"". But to do that, I need to manipulate the existing rule.

Alternatively, create a new rule ""wall is push"" by placing the necessary text blocks. But where?

Another idea: The key is win, so if I can get the key without moving through the walls, maybe by lifting it or something. But the key is on the ground, I think. So I need to reach it.

Wait, perhaps I can use the door. The door is at 5 steps right and 1 step up. If I can open the door with the key, but the active rules don't mention door properties. Maybe the door is only opened when you have the key? But the rules don't specify that. The key is win, so maybe picking up the key makes you win regardless of the door.

Alternatively, maybe the door is a way to exit, but I don't know how.

Back to the main problem: How to move the ""stop"" block to break the ""wall is stop"" rule.

Baba's current position is at the rule `baba` block, which is 2 left and 3 down. Let's assume coordinates where up is positive y and left is negative x. So Baba is at (-2, -3).

The ""stop"" block is at (-1, 2). To get there, I need to move right (increase x) and up (increase y). But the path is blocked by walls.

Looking at the objects:

- At (3,3) is a wall.
- At (3,2) is a wall.
- At (3,1) is a wall.
- The key is at (7,0).
- The door is at (5,1).
- The ""stop"" block is at (-1,2).

There's a wall at (3,3), which is to the right and above Baba. To reach the ""stop"" block at (-1,2), Baba needs to move up and right, but the wall at (3,3) is in the way. Unless there's a way around.

Wait, maybe there's a different path. Let's see the map layout based on the objects:

From Baba's position (-2,-3):

- Moving up: there's a wall at (3,3), but that's far to the right. Maybe there's a way to go left or around.

But to the left of Baba, there are text blocks at (-3, 2), (-2, 2), (-1, 2): wall, is, stop. So those are stacked to the left and up.

To the right of Baba, there are walls starting at (3,3) and moving down.

The ball is at (3,2), which is a wall's position. So maybe the ball is on a wall, but it's a separate object.

The door is at (5,1), key at (7,0).

So perhaps the only way to reach the ""stop"" block is to navigate around the walls to the left, but the text blocks there are part of the ""wall is stop"" rule. Moving them would break the rule, but how?

Alternatively, maybe I can move the text blocks that form the ""baba is you"" rule. The ""baba"" rule is at (-2, -3) (Baba's position), then ""is"" at (-3, -3), and ""you"" at (-3, -3 +1) = (-3, -2). Wait, the objects list says:

rule `baba` 2 step to the left and 3 steps down

So from the reference point (assuming the wall at 0,0 is the starting point), rule `baba` is at (-2, -3). Then rule `is` is 1 step to the left and 3 steps down from that, so (-3, -3). Then rule `you` is 3 steps down from the previous? Wait, the objects list says:

rule `baba` 2 step to the left and 3 steps down

rule `is` 2 step to the left and 3 steps down

rule `you` 1 step to the left and 3 steps down

Wait, no. Let me check the exact objects list:

rule `baba` 2 step to the left and 3 steps down

rule `is` 1 step to the left and 3 steps down

rule `you` 3 steps down

So:

- rule `baba` is at (-2, -3)
- rule `is` is at (-1, -3)
- rule `you` is at (-2, -3 + 3) = (-2, 0)? Or is it 3 steps down from the previous? The description says ""rule `you` 1 step to the left and 3 steps down"". Wait, the original observation has:

rule `baba` 2 step to the left and 3 steps down

rule `is` 1 step to the left and 3 steps down

rule `you` 1 step to the left and 3 steps down

Wait, the exact entry is:

""rule `baba` 2 step to the left and 3 steps down

rule `is` 2 step to the left and 3 steps down

rule `you` 1 step to the left and 3 steps down""

Wait, no, looking back at the user's previous observations, in one of them it's:

rule `baba` 2 step to the left and 3 steps down

rule `is` 1 step to the left and 3 steps down

rule `you` 3 steps down

But in other observations, it's different. This is getting too complicated. Maybe I should focus on the latest observation provided.

In the latest observation before the current one, the objects are:

rule `baba` 2 step to the left and 3 steps down

rule `is` 1 step to the left and 3 steps down

rule `you` 1 step to the left and 3 steps down

So Baba is at (-2, -3), the `is` is at (-1, -3), and `you` is at (-1, -3 + 3) = (-1, 0)? Or is it 3 steps down from Baba","

Let's try to figure out how to solve this Baba Is You level. The active rules are ""key is win"", ""wall is stop"", and ""baba is you"". My goal is usually to reach the win object, which is currently the key. But since the key is defined as win, maybe I need to get the key to become the win object, which it already is. But maybe there's a door involved here?

Looking at the map, there's a door at 5 steps right and 1 step up. To get to the door, I probably need to move past some walls. The walls are all labeled as stop, so I can't move through them. But since I'm Baba, and ""baba is you"", I can move around unless there's a stop property. Wait, the walls are stop, so they block me.

The key is at 6 steps right. If I can get to the key, maybe I can pick it up? But how? In Baba Is You, you can push objects if they're not stop. Wait, the rules say ""wall is stop"", so walls can't be moved. But the key isn't a wall, right? The key's rule is ""key is win"", so it's an object. Can I push the key? Maybe, but I need to check if there's any rule preventing that. Since there's no rule like ""key is push"" or ""key is stop"", maybe I can move it.

But how do I get to the key? The path is blocked by walls. Let me see the objects again. There's a ball at 3 steps right and 2 steps up. Maybe I can use that to block a wall? Or perhaps rearrange the rules to change the stop property.

The rules are in the format [Subject] IS [Property]. The current rules are key is win, wall is stop, and baba is you. If I can move the rule texts to create new rules, maybe I can change what's stop. For example, if I make ""wall is not stop"", then walls wouldn't block me. But how do I move the rule blocks?

The rule `wall` is at 3 steps left and 2 steps up, next to `is` and `stop`. If I can move those rule texts together to form a new rule like ""wall is you"" or something, that might help. But I need to see where I am. Wait, where is Baba located? The observation doesn't explicitly state Baba's position, but looking at the objects, there's a rule `baba` at 3 steps left and 3 steps down. So Baba is at that position. 

So, to get to the key, which is at 6 steps right, I need to move right multiple times. But the path is blocked by walls. Maybe I can push the walls? But walls are stop, so can't be moved. Unless there's a rule allowing it. Alternatively, maybe I can change the rule ""wall is stop"" to something else. For example, if I make ""stop is key"", then stops would be key, which might not block me. But how to do that?

The rule `stop` is at 1 step left and 2 steps up. The `is` is next to it. If I can move the `stop` rule and the `is` rule together with another subject, like ""wall"", then I can create a new rule. For instance, moving `wall` to the left of `is` and `stop` would make ""wall is stop"", which is the existing rule. But to change it, I need to replace parts of the existing rules.

Alternatively, since the key is win, and I need to reach the key, maybe I can make the door the win instead. The door is at 5 steps right and 1 step up. If I can change the win rule to door, then going to the door would be the goal. But how? The current win rule is at 7 steps right and 3 steps up. To change that, I need to move the `win` text block and the `is` next to it with a new subject.

Wait, the `key` rule is at 5 steps right, `is` at 6, `win` at 7. So the rule is ""key is win"". If I can move the `win` text to the door's position, then the rule would be ""key is door"", which might not help. Alternatively, if I can create a new rule like ""door is win"", that would make the door the win object. But the door is at 5 steps right and 1 step up. There's a `door` rule at 5 steps right and 1 step up. If I can move that `door` rule and combine it with `is` and `win`, that could work.

Let me think step by step. My current position is at the `baba` rule block, which is 3 steps left and 3 steps down. So I'm not at the starting position of Baba, but perhaps the Baba tile is where the `baba` rule is. To move, I need to use the direction actions. Let's see the objects around me. To the right are walls, but maybe I can move left to get to the rule blocks.

If I move left from my current position (3 left, 3 down), there's a `rule is` at 2 left and 3 down, and `rule you` at 1 left and 3 down. Maybe I can move those to create a new rule. For example, if I can make ""baba is win"", then I myself would be win. But how? The existing `baba` rule is at 3 left and 3 down, `is` at 2 left and 3 down, and `you` at 1 left and 3 down. If I can rearrange these to form ""baba is win"", that would be ideal. 

To do that, I need to move the `win` text which is at 7 right and 3 up. That's quite far. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to push the `win` text block closer. But since the walls are stop, I can't push them. Unless I can change the stop property. 

Another approach: Since the key is win, and the key is located at 6 steps right, maybe I just need to get to the key. But the path is blocked by walls. However, if I can make the walls not stop, then I can walk through them. To do that, I need to change the ""wall is stop"" rule. The `wall` rule is at 4 left and 2 up, `is` at 3 left and 2 up, `stop` at 2 left and 2 up. If I can rearrange these to make ""wall is not stop"" or another property, that would help. 

But how to move those text blocks? Let's say I'm at the `baba` rule block (3 left, 3 down). To move up, there's a wall at 2 right and 3 up. To move left, there's the `rule is` and `rule you` blocks. Maybe I can move left to get to the `rule you` and then combine it with other blocks. 

Alternatively, perhaps I can push the `win` rule to the key's position. If the rule ""key is win"" is moved so that ""key"" is next to ""win"" with an ""is"", that's already the case. But maybe I need to interact with the key itself. If I can pick up the key, then carry it to the door or somewhere else. But in Baba Is You, you can't pick up objects; you can push them if they're not stop. Since the key isn't stop, maybe I can push it. 

But the key is at 6 steps right. To get there, I need to move right past the walls. Let's see the path from my current position (assuming I'm at the `baba` rule block, which is 3 left, 3 down). To move right, there's a wall at 2 right and 3 up. Wait, the wall is 2 steps right and 3 steps up from where? Maybe the coordinates are relative to Baba's position. This is getting a bit confusing without a visual map. 

Alternatively, let's focus on the rule manipulation. The key is win, so if I can reach the key, maybe that's sufficient. But the key is behind walls. However, if I can change the ""wall is stop"" rule to something else, like ""wall is push"", then I could potentially push the walls out of the way. But to do that, I need to rearrange the rule blocks. 

The `wall` rule is at 4 left and 2 up, `is` at 3 left and 2 up, `stop` at 2 left and 2 up. If I can move these to form ""wall is push"", that would allow pushing walls. But how to move them? The `is` block is between `wall` and `stop`. To change the property, I need to replace `stop` with `push`. So perhaps moving the `stop` block away and placing a `push` block there. But where is the `push` block? It's not listed in the current objects. The available rule blocks are key, is, win, wall, stop, door, baba, you. So maybe I have to create ""push"" by rearranging existing blocks? No, I think the available properties are the ones present in the rules. 

Wait, the current rules are key is win, wall is stop, baba is you. So the properties are win, stop, you. There's no push property defined. Therefore, I can't create a ""wall is push"" rule unless I have a push text block, which I don't. So that approach might not work. 

Another idea: If I can make the door the win instead of the key. The door is at 5 steps right and 1 step up. There's a `door` rule at 5 steps right and 1 step up. If I can form a rule ""door is win"", then going to the door would make me win. To do that, I need to move the `win` block from the key's position to the door's position. 

The `win` block is at 7 steps right and 3 steps up. The door is at 5 steps right and 1 step up. So I need to move the `win` block left and down. But how? The only way to move rule blocks is to move them adjacent to them and then push them, but since walls are stop, I can't push them through walls. Unless I can change the wall's property. 

This seems tricky. Maybe another approach: Since I'm Baba and ""baba is you"", maybe I can use the key to interact with something. But the key is win, so maybe picking up the key makes me win? But I already have the key as win; I need to get to it. 

Wait, the key is at 6 steps right. If I can move right three times from my current position, but there are walls blocking the way. Let me check the path again. From the `baba` rule block (3 left, 3 down), moving right: there's a wall at 2 right and 3 up. Wait, maybe the coordinates are relative. This is getting confusing. Maybe I need to focus on the rule blocks nearby. 

The `rule you` is at 1 step left and 3 steps down. If I can move left to get to that, perhaps I can rearrange the rules. For example, moving the `you` block next to `baba` and `is` to make ""baba is you"", which is already the case. Not helpful. 

Alternatively, the `door` rule is at 5 right and 1 up. If I can create a rule ""door is win"", then going to the door would work. To do that, I need to move the `win` block to the door's location. But the `win` block is at 7 right and 3 up. There's a path of rule blocks: key, is, win. So maybe I can push the entire ""key is win"" rule to the left. But the blocks are likely attached, so moving one might move the whole rule. 

If I can move the `key` block left, then the entire rule ""key is win"" would move, allowing me to place the `win` block at the door's position. But the problem is that the path is blocked by walls. The `key` block is at 5 right, 3 up. To move it left, I need to be adjacent and push it, but the walls are stop. Unless I can change the walls to not be stop. 

This is really challenging. Maybe the solution is to rearrange the rules to make ""baba is win"". Since I'm Baba and ""baba is you"", if I can make ""baba is win"", then I would be win. The existing `baba` rule is at 3 left, 3 down. If I can move the `win` block next to `baba` and `is`, that would form ""baba is win"". 

The `win` block is at 7 right and 3 up. That's quite far from the `baba` rule. Maybe I can move the `win` block left by pushing it through the existing rules. But the `key is win` rule is a single unit? Or can individual blocks be separated? In Baba Is You, the rules are three blocks: subject, is, property. So ""key is win"" is three blocks connected. To move the `win` block, I would need to move the entire rule. 

But the `key` rule is at 5 right, 3 up. To move it left, I would need to be adjacent to it and push it. However, there's a wall at 2 right and 3 up, which is stop. So I can't push past that. Unless I can make the wall not stop. 

This seems like a dead end. Another possibility: The door is present, and maybe there's a way to unlock it using the key. But there's no ""door is unlock"" rule or anything. The door's rule is just ""door"", I think. 

Wait, the `door` rule is at 5 steps right and 1 step up. If I can create a rule like ""door is key"", then maybe interacting with the door with the key would do something. But how? 

Alternatively, since the key is win, maybe just grabbing the key makes me win. But in Baba Is You, you have to be at the win object. So even if the key is win, you need to be on the key tile. 

So the plan is: Move to the key's position (6 right) by rearranging rules to remove the walls blocking the path. But how? 

Alternatively, use the fact that ""baba is you"" to push blocks. If I can push a wall out of the way by being a you. But walls are stop, so pushing them isn't possible unless the rule allows it. 

Wait, maybe I can change the ""wall is stop"" to ""wall is push"". If I can do that, then walls can be pushed. The `wall` rule is at 4 left and 2 up, `is` at 3 left and 2 up, `stop` at 2 left and 2 up. To change it to ""wall is push"", I need to replace `stop` with `push`. But where is the `push` block? It's not listed in the objects. So unless I can create it by rearranging other blocks, which I can't, this isn't possible. 

This is really tricky. Maybe the solution is simpler. Since the key is win, and I need to be on the key to win, I just need to reach it. But the path is blocked. However, if I can make the walls not stop, then I can walk through them. To make walls not stop, change ""wall is stop"" to ""wall is you"" or something. 

The `wall` rule is at 4 left, 2 up. The `is` is at 3 left, 2 up. The `stop` is at 2 left, 2 up. If I can move the `stop` to another position and replace it with `you`, then walls would be you, and I could push them. But again, I don't have a `you` block there. The `you` block is at 1 left, 3 down, which is far away. 

Alternatively, create a new rule ""wall is you"" by moving the `wall`, `is`, and `you` blocks together. But the `you` block is at 1 left, 3 down, which is quite distant from the `wall` and `is` blocks at 4 left, 2 up. 

Maybe I need to move the `you` block closer. If I can move left from my current position (3 left, 3 down), there's the `rule is` at 2 left, 3 down, and `rule you` at 1 left, 3 down. If I move left to 1 left, 3 down (the `you` block), then maybe I can push it up or something. But I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, focus on the key. The key is at 6 right, 3 up. To get there, I need to move right three times. But there's a wall at 2 right, 3 up. Unless I can move that wall. 

Wait, the wall at 2 right, 3 up is part of the ""wall is stop"" rule. If I can delete that rule or change it, then the wall wouldn't be stop. But how? Deleting rules isn't a standard action, but you can move them away. If I can move the ""wall is stop"" rule off the screen, then effectively, the rule is removed. 

The ""wall is stop"" rule is composed of three blocks: `wall` at 4 left, 2 up; `is` at 3 left, 2 up; `stop` at 2 left, 2 up. If I can move these blocks away, the rule is no longer active. For example, moving the `stop` block down might take the entire rule off the relevant part of the map. 

But how to move those blocks. If I'm at the `baba` rule block (3 left, 3 down), moving up would take me to the `is` and `you` blocks. Maybe I can push the `stop` block down. If I move down from the `stop` block's position (2 left, 2 up) to 2 left, 3 up, but there's a wall there. Or to 2 left, 1 up, which might be empty. 

This is getting too complicated without a visual. Maybe the intended solution is to move the ""key is win"" rule to the door, making the door the win. To do that, move the","

I need to solve this Baba Is You level. The active rules are key is win, wall is stop, and baba is you. My goal is usually to reach the win object, which in this case is the key. But right now, the key is marked as win, so maybe I need to get to the key to win.

Looking at the map, I see that there's a rule `key` positioned at 6 steps to the right and 3 steps up. The `is` and `win` rules are following it, forming ""key is win"". So the key is the win object. But there are walls around, some marked as stop. Since wall is stop, I can't move through them. The ball is at 4 steps right and 2 up, but I don't know if that's relevant.

The player (Baba) is probably at a starting position, but the observation doesn't explicitly mention Baba's location. Wait, the rules include ""baba is you"", which means wherever Baba is, he can move. So I need to find Baba on the map. Looking at the objects, there's a rule `baba` at 2 steps left and 3 steps down from the current position. So Baba is located there. Let me visualize the map.

From the current position (assuming I'm at the origin), the walls and rules are arranged in specific directions. The key is far to the right, and there's a door at 6 steps right and 1 step up. The wall at 3 steps right and 3 steps down might be blocking some path. The rules for `baba`, `is`, and `you` are down at the bottom left.

To reach the key, which is at 6 right, 3 up, I need to move right and up. But there are walls in the way. For example, wall at 3 steps right and 3 up, and others. The door at 6 right and 1 up might be movable if I can change its property. But the door's rule is present, but it's not clear if it's a stop or not. Since wall is stop, but door's rule isn't stated here. Wait, active rules are key is win, wall is stop, and baba is you. So door's property isn't defined as stop, so maybe I can push it or move past it.

But how to get past the walls. The walls are at 3 steps right and 3 up, 2 left and 2 up, etc. Maybe I need to rearrange the rules. The `baba` rule is at 2 left, 3 down. If I can move that rule to make myself a different object, like 'win' or 'key', that might help. For example, if I can make Baba into 'win', then wherever I go, it's a win. Or make 'key' into 'stop' to avoid it, but that's counterproductive.

Alternatively, maybe I need to move the 'key is win' rule to a different position so that the key isn't the win anymore. But the rules are fixed unless I can move them. The 'key', 'is', and 'win' rules are in a sequence. To change the rule, I need to break them apart. For instance, move the 'is' or 'win' to a different spot to alter the rule.

Looking at the current setup, the key is 5 steps right and 3 up, followed by 'is' and 'win'. So the rule is ""key is win"". If I can move the 'is' or 'win' to another position, maybe I can create a new rule that changes the win condition. But how?

Alternatively, since I'm Baba and I can move, maybe I can push objects if they're not stop. The walls are stop, so I can't push them. But the rules might be movable if they're not stop. The 'baba' rule is at 2 left, 3 down. If I can move that rule to say, 'baba is win', then I would be win. But how to do that?

Wait, the 'you' rule is part of the 'baba is you' rule. The 'you' is at 1 step left and 3 steps down. So the rule is 'baba is you' located at 3 left, 3 down. If I can move the 'you' part to another object, maybe I can make myself win. For example, move the 'you' to 'win', making 'baba is win', which would make me the win condition.

But to move the 'you' rule, I need to be able to push it. Since the 'you' rule isn't defined as stop, and assuming that text blocks can be moved unless specified otherwise. So if I can navigate to the 'you' rule at 1 left, 3 down, and move it, perhaps to adjacent positions to form a new rule.

The current position of 'you' is 1 step left and 3 steps down. If I move left from there, but there's a wall at 3 steps right and 3 steps down, but maybe my position is different. Wait, the observation lists objects relative to the player's position. So the player is somewhere, and all objects are described relative to that. For example, 'wall 3 steps to the right and 3 step up' means three steps right and three up from the player's current position.

Assuming the player is at (0,0), then the 'baba' rule is at (-2, -3). The 'you' rule is at (-1, -3). To move the 'you' rule, I need to go to its position and move it. Let's say I move left to reach the 'you' rule. But the player's current position isn't specified, but the objects are relative. Maybe the player is adjacent to the 'baba' rule or somewhere else.

Alternatively, the player might be at a position where they can move towards the 'you' rule. If I can get to the 'you' rule and then move it next to 'baba' and 'is' to form a new rule, like 'baba is win'. That would make the player win.

So the plan would be:

1. Navigate to the 'you' rule at 1 step left and 3 steps down.
2. Move the 'you' rule to a position adjacent to 'baba' and 'is' to create 'baba is win'.
3. Then, the player (Baba) would be the win condition, so reaching any 'win' object (like the key) would complete the level.

To do this, the player needs to move left to reach the 'you' rule. From the observations, after previous actions, the player might have moved right multiple times, but now the 'you' rule is at 1 left and 3 down. So moving left would be the first step.

But wait, the last few actions were left, right, left, etc., maybe getting the player to a certain position. The current observation shows that after some movements, the 'key' is further right, and the 'you' rule is down. So perhaps the player is now in a position where moving left can reach the 'you' rule.

Alternatively, maybe the player needs to push the 'you' rule. Since 'you' isn't stop, they can move it. So moving left towards the 'you' rule, then grabbing it and moving it up or next to 'baba' and 'is'.

But how to do that in the game? Each action is a single step. So the player would need to move to the 'you' rule's location, then move it by adjacent steps.

Assuming the player is currently at a position where moving left would get them to the 'you' rule. Let's say the player is one step right and one step up from the 'you' rule. Then moving left would reach the 'you' rule, and then moving it to the left or up to attach to the 'baba is' rule.

But the exact path depends on the current player position, which isn't explicitly given. However, the objects are listed relative to the player. For example, 'wall 3 steps to the right and 3 step up' implies that the player is looking at the map from a certain point.

Given that the 'baba' rule is at 3 left and 3 down, and the 'you' is at 1 left and 3 down, the player is probably somewhere above or to the right of these rules. To reach the 'you' rule, the player would need to move left and down.

But in the latest observations, after previous left and right movements, the player's position might have changed. For example, if they kept moving right, the relative positions of the objects would shift. However, the problem is that the relative positions are from the player's current location, so each movement changes how the objects are positioned relative to the player.

This is getting a bit confusing. Let's try to simplify.

The key is at 6 right, 3 up. The 'win' rule is following the key, so key is win. To get the key, I need to reach it, but there are walls blocking the path. The walls are at 3 right, 3 up, and others. The door is at 6 right, 1 up, which might be a way through if I can move it or change its property.

Alternatively, by manipulating the rules, I can change the win condition. For example, if I can make 'baba' the win, then just standing on Baba would make me win. But the current rule is 'baba is you', so I'm Baba, but the win is the key.

To make 'baba' the win, I need to create a new rule 'baba is win'. The existing rules are 'key is win', so if I can break that rule and create a new one.

The 'you' rule is part of the 'baba is you' rule. If I can move the 'you' to 'win', then the rule becomes 'baba is win'. So the plan is:

1. Move to the 'you' rule located at 1 left, 3 down.
2. Move the 'you' rule to be next to 'baba' and 'is' to form 'baba is win'.

To do this, the player needs to navigate to the 'you' rule. Given that the last action was 'left' and the observation shows the 'you' is still at 1 left and 3 down, maybe the player is now positioned such that moving left again would get closer.

Alternatively, if the player is at a position where they can move left to reach the 'you' rule, then grabbing it and moving it up or next to the 'baba' rule.

But in the game, each action is a single step, so moving left multiple times might be needed. However, the observations show that after several left and right movements, the positions of the rules have shifted. For example, after moving right, the key and its rules moved further right.

Wait, in the latest observation, after moving right, the key is now at 6 steps right and 3 up, whereas before it was at 5 steps. So each time the player moves right, the entire map shifts left relative to the player? Or the other way around. It's a bit unclear, but it seems that moving right makes the objects to the right become closer, and moving left makes them further.

This is tricky. Let's try to focus on the immediate goal. The 'you' rule is at 1 left and 3 down. To reach it, the player needs to move left and down. But how?

If the player is currently at (0,0), then moving left would take them to (-1,0), but the 'you' is at (-1, -3). So the player needs to move left once, then down three times. But walls might be in the way. Looking at the objects, there's a wall at 3 steps right and 3 down, but that's on the opposite side. The walls near the 'you' area are at 2 step left and 2 up, which is not in the way.

Alternatively, the player might be blocked by other objects. For example, if moving down from the current position hits a stop wall. But the active rules say wall is stop, so any wall object is stop. The walls are at various positions, but the 'you' area doesn't have walls blocking it according to the observation.

So the steps could be:

1. Move left once to get to the 'you' rule's x-coordinate.
2. Then move down three times to reach the 'you' rule's position.
3. Once at the 'you' rule, move it next to the 'baba' and 'is' rules to form 'baba is win'.

But each movement is a single step. So from the current position, which is unknown, but based on the latest observation, the 'you' rule is at 1 left and 3 down. If the player is at a position where they can move left and down without hitting walls, that's the way to go.

Alternatively, maybe the player can push the 'you' rule by moving adjacent to it. Since 'you' isn't a stop, the player can move into it and then move in a direction, carrying the 'you' rule with them.

For example, if the player is to the right of the 'you' rule, they can move left into the 'you' rule, then move left again, pushing the 'you' rule further left. Repeating this could move the 'you' rule to the desired position.

But this requires precise movement. Let's assume the player is positioned such that they can move left into the 'you' rule. Then, by moving left while holding the 'you' rule, they can place it next to the 'baba' and 'is' rules.

In the latest observation, after several right and left movements, the 'baba' rule is at 2 left and 3 down, 'is' at 1 left and 3 down, and 'you' at 3 down. So the 'baba is you' rule is spread out. To form 'baba is win', the 'win' needs to be next to the 'is'.

The 'win' rule is at 7 right and 3 up, which is far from the 'baba' rule. So moving the 'you' to 'win' position isn't feasible. Instead, the better approach is to take the 'you' and move it to be after 'baba' and 'is', making 'baba is you win' or adjusting the positions to form 'baba is win'.

Alternatively, since the existing rule is 'key is win', if we can move the 'win' to be after 'baba', we'd have 'baba is win'. But the 'win' is currently at 7 right and 3 up, which is far away.

This seems complicated. Another approach: since the key is the win object, and it's located at 6 right and 3 up, maybe the player can reach it by moving right past the walls. But the walls at 3 right and 3 up are stop, so can't move through. The door at 6 right and 1 up might be a way. If the door can be moved or its property changed, maybe it's not a stop.

But the active rules don't define door as stop, so it's movable. If I can push the door out of the way or change its property, but I don't have a 'door is stop' or similar rule.

Alternatively, maybe the door is a separator, and to get past the walls, I need to use the door. But without a 'door is stop' rule, it's just an object that can be moved. So if I can move the door, perhaps I can create a path.

But this seems like a detour. The main goal is to change the win condition to self. So focusing back on moving the 'you' rule.

In the latest observation, the 'you' is at 3 steps down. To reach it, the player needs to move down three times. But are there walls blocking? The walls are at various positions, but the path down from the player's current position to the 'you' rule at 3 down might be clear.

Assuming the player can move down three times safely, they can reach the 'you' rule. Once there, they can move it left or right to attach to the 'baba' and 'is' rules.

For example, if the player moves down three times to reach the 'you' rule at (current x, current y -3), then moves left to be next to the 'is' rule (which is at 1 left and 3 down), then places the 'you' there, forming 'baba is win'.

But the exact movements depend on the player's current position relative to these objects. Since the player's position isn't given, it's challenging, but based on the observations, the 'baba' rule is at 3 left and 3 down, 'is' at 2 left and 3 down, 'you' at 1 left and 3 down. So the 'baba is you' rule is spread across three tiles: 'baba' at 3 left, 'is' at 2 left, 'you' at 1 left, all at 3 down.

To make 'baba is win', we need to replace 'you' with 'win'. So the player needs to move the 'you' rule to the position after 'baba' and 'is', which would be at 0 left and 3 down, and place a 'win' there. But 'win' is currently at 7 right and 3 up. So this isn't feasible unless we can move the 'win' rule.

Alternatively, take the 'you' rule and move it to the right next to 'baba' and 'is', and then add a 'win' rule. But where is the 'win' rule? It's far to the right. This seems impractical.

Another idea: since the key is win, and it's located at 6 right and 3 up, maybe the player can push the key towards themselves. But the key is an object, and unless there's a rule allowing it to be moved, but the active rules don't state that. The key's rule is 'key is win', but that's a property, not a movement rule.

Alternatively, if the player can make the key a stop, then they can't push it, but that's not helpful. If they can make the key a you, then they can move it. But 'key is win' is a rule, so to change it, they need to break the rule.

To break the 'key is win' rule, they need to move the 'is' or 'win' part. For example, move the 'win' to another position, making the rule 'key is' which is incomplete, effectively removing the rule. Then, they can create a new rule 'baba is win'.

But the 'win' is at 7 right and 3 up, far from the player. So moving it would require many","

Let's see. The active rules are key is win, wall is stop, and baba is you. My goal is probably to get to the key, since key is win. But walls are stop, so I need to avoid them.

Looking at the objects on the map: the player is Baba, right? Because baba is you. So I need to move Baba to the key. The key is 7 steps to the right. But there's a wall 3 steps to the right, and the key is further right beyond that. Also, there are other walls and a door at 6 steps right. The door might be a way out once I have the key.

Wait, the rule says key is win, so picking up the key would make it the win object. But how do I pick it up? Maybe by moving onto it? Or do I need to rearrange the rules? Let me think. Since baba is you, I can move around. But walls are stop, so I can't go through them. The key is 7 steps right, but there's a wall at 3 steps right. So if I move right three times, I hit a wall. That's a problem. Maybe I need to change some rules to bypass the walls.

The rules available are the ones on the map. There's a rule `wall` 2 steps left and 2 steps up. Maybe I can move that rule to make walls not stop me. For example, if I can change wall to something else, like ""wall is stop"" is a rule, but maybe I can replace it. Wait, how do you change rules? You have to move the text blocks. So if I can grab the ""wall is stop"" rule and move it somewhere else, or replace it with a new rule.

Looking at the objects, there's a rule `stop` 1 step left and 2 steps up. Maybe I can create a new rule that makes stop something else. Like, if I can move the ""stop"" text block and combine it with another. For example, ""stop is push"" or something. But I need to see where the text blocks are located.

The rule `wall` is at 2 steps left and 2 steps up, rule `is` is at 1 step left and 2 steps up, and rule `stop` is at 1 step left and 2 steps up. So those three form ""wall is stop"". To break that rule, I might need to move the ""is"" or ""stop"" away. But how do I move them? Since I'm Baba, and if I can move objects that aren't stop. Wait, the rules say wall is stop, so any wall is immovable. But the text blocks that define the rules might not be walls. Are the text blocks considered separate from the objects they define?

Hmm, this is a bit confusing. The text blocks like ""key is win"" are probably objects themselves. So if a text block is not part of a stop property, I can move it. For example, the rule `key` at 5 steps right and 3 steps up is a text block. Since key isn't defined as stop, I can move that. Similarly, the ""is"" and ""win"" text blocks can be moved.

So the plan is: get to the key, but it's blocked by walls. To do that, I need to remove the ""wall is stop"" rule. To do that, I need to move the ""is"" or ""stop"" text blocks that make up that rule. Let's see where they are. The ""wall is stop"" rule is composed of three text blocks: rule `wall` at 2 left, 2 up; rule `is` at 1 left, 2 up; and rule `stop` at 1 left, 2 up. So if I can move any of these, I can break the rule.

But how do I move them? Since I'm Baba (you), I can move objects that are not stop. The walls are stop, but the text blocks might not be walls. So the text blocks like ""wall"", ""is"", ""stop"" are separate objects. So I can move them. Let's check the positions again.

The rule `wall` is at 2 left, 2 up. That's a text block saying ""wall is..."", so maybe moving that would change the rule. If I can move the ""is"" or ""stop"" from the ""wall is stop"" rule, that would break it. For example, moving the ""stop"" text block away would mean the rule is no longer ""wall is stop"".

So maybe the approach is to move the ""stop"" text block from its current position. Where is it? At 1 step left and 2 steps up. If I can move that to another position, like combining it with another ""is"" or ""rule"", maybe creating a new rule that makes stop into something else, like ""stop is push"" or ""stop is you"", which might make walls movable.

Alternatively, create a new rule that says ""wall is you"", which would make walls controllable. But how?

Let me think about the steps. First, I need to get to the text blocks. My current position isn't clear, but the objects listed are walls, rules, and the key. Maybe the player is located somewhere on the map. Assuming the player is Baba, who is you, I need to find where Baba is. Looking at the objects, there's a rule `baba` 3 steps left and 3 steps down. So the Baba text block is there. To move Baba, I need to move that text block, but since Baba is you, you can move it, right?

Wait, in Baba Is You, the player is usually the Baba text block that's connected to ""you"". So if the rule is ""baba is you"", then the Baba object (the one with the ""baba"" text block) can be moved. So the player is that Baba text block. So to move, I need to move that specific Baba object.

Looking at the objects, the rule `baba` is at 3 steps left and 3 steps down. So the player is there. So I need to move that Baba text block to the right or left, up or down, avoiding walls.

But the walls are stop, so moving into a wall would be impossible. So the challenge is to reach the key by moving around the walls, possibly by changing the rules.

So first, let's see the path. The key is at 7 steps right. From the player's position (3 left, 3 down), moving right would go through walls. For example, 3 steps right would hit a wall at 3 steps right. So that's blocked. Maybe go up? Let's see. From the player's position (3 left, 3 down), moving up would be towards the rule `key` at 6 steps right and 3 up. Wait, the player is at 3 left, 3 down. So to go up, each step up would decrease the down steps. For example, moving up one step would be 3 left, 2 down. Then up again to 3 left, 1 down. Then up to 3 left, 0 down (same level as the wall at 3 right and 3 up). But the wall is at 3 right and 3 up, which is diagonally up from the player's position. So maybe moving up and right?

But the player is at 3 left, 3 down. To get to the key at 7 right, 3 up, need to move right 10 steps and up 6 steps. But there are walls in the way. The wall at 3 right and 3 up is directly above the key's column. So perhaps the way is blocked unless we change the wall rule.

Alternatively, maybe the door at 6 steps right and 1 step up is a way out. But to use the door, you need to have the key, I think. Since key is win, maybe picking up the key makes it possible to win by going through the door.

So the plan is: get the key, which is at 7 right. But to get there, need to move through or around walls. Since walls are stop, maybe change the rule of wall to something else. For example, if we can make wall not stop, then we can pass through them.

To change the ""wall is stop"" rule, we need to move the text blocks that make it up. The ""wall is stop"" rule is composed of three text blocks: rule `wall` at 2 left, 2 up; rule `is` at 1 left, 2 up; and rule `stop` at 1 left, 2 up. If we can move any of these, we can break the rule.

For example, moving the ""stop"" text block from 1 left, 2 up to another position. Where can we move it? Maybe combine it with another ""is"" to form a new rule. Like, if we move ""stop"" and ""is"" together with another subject, we can create a new rule.

Alternatively, create a rule that says ""stop is push"", which would make stop objects pushable. Or ""stop is you"", making them controllable.

But how to do that? Let's see the available text blocks. There's a rule `door` at 6 right, 1 up. Also, the key, is, win, wall, etc. Maybe we can take the ""stop"" text block and combine it with ""is"" and another subject to form a new rule.

For instance, if we move the ""stop"" block to be next to ""door"" and ""is"", creating ""door is stop"", but that might not help. Alternatively, move ""stop"" to be after ""baba"" and ""is"", making ""baba is stop"", which would make Baba a stop, but that's bad because then we can't move.

Alternatively, move ""stop"" to be after ""wall"" and ""is"", but that's the original rule. Hmm.

Alternatively, create a new rule ""wall is you"". To do that, we need the text blocks ""wall"", ""is"", and ""you"". The ""you"" is at 1 left, 3 down (from rule `you` 1 step to the left and 3 steps down). So if we can gather ""wall"", ""is"", and ""you"" in sequence, we can create the new rule.

The player is at the ""baba"" rule at 3 left, 3 down. Let's see the positions:

- rule `baba`: 3 left, 3 down
- rule `is`: 2 left, 3 down
- rule `you`: 1 left, 3 down

So these are all in a row to the right of the player. If the player moves right, they can pick up these rules. But wait, can the player move the text blocks? Since the player is Baba (you), and the rules don't say that text blocks are stop, they can be moved.

So maybe the steps are:

1. Move right to pick up the ""is"" and ""you"" rules.
2. Combine them with ""wall"" to create ""wall is you"".
3. Now walls are you, so they can be moved.
4. Then navigate through the walls to the key.

But how to execute this movement.

The player's current position is at the ""baba"" rule, 3 left, 3 down. To move right, each step right would be:

- Step 1: 2 left, 3 down (to the ""is"" rule)
- Step 2: 1 left, 3 down (to the ""you"" rule)
- Step 3: 0 left, 3 down (but there's a wall at 2 right and 3 up, not sure about this direction)

Wait, the walls are at various positions. For example, wall at 2 right and 3 up, which is up from the key's position. But moving right from the player's position (3 left, 3 down) would be towards the ""is"" and ""you"" rules. Once the player moves right three times, they would be at 0 left, 3 down, but I'm not sure if that's blocked.

Alternatively, maybe the player needs to move up first. Let's see. From 3 left, 3 down, moving up one step would be 3 left, 2 down. Then up again to 3 left, 1 down. Then up to 3 left, 0 down (same level as the wall at 3 right and 3 up, which is diagonally up-right). But there's a wall at 3 right and 3 up, so moving up from 3 left, 3 down would be towards that wall if moving right.

This is getting complicated. Let's try to outline a possible path.

First, gather the necessary text blocks to create ""wall is you"". The components are ""wall"", ""is"", and ""you"". These are located at:

- ""wall"" rule: 2 left, 2 up
- ""is"" rule: varies depending on the current setup. Initially, there's an ""is"" at 2 left, 2 up (part of ""wall is stop""), and another ""is"" at 1 left, 3 down (near the ""you"" rule).

The ""you"" rule is at 1 left, 3 down.

So the player is at 3 left, 3 down. To reach the ""you"" rule, they need to move right twice: once to 2 left, 3 down (to the ""is"" rule), then to 1 left, 3 down (to the ""you"" rule). Then, they need to get the ""wall"" rule at 2 left, 2 up. So from 1 left, 3 down, move up to 1 left, 2 down, then left to 2 left, 2 down, then up to 2 left, 2 up (where the ""wall"" rule is).

Once all three text blocks are in place, create the new rule ""wall is you"". Then, walls can be moved. Then, navigate to the key by moving around the walls.

But this requires moving the text blocks precisely. However, each time you move a text block, you have to make sure you're not moving into a stop object. Since the initial rules have wall as stop, but once we change that, it might be okay.

Alternatively, maybe a simpler approach: move the ""stop"" rule away. The ""stop"" text block is at 1 left, 2 up. If we can move it, say, to the right, next to the ""key"" rule, then the ""wall is stop"" rule is broken. Then walls are no longer stop, and we can move through them.

To do that, the player would need to move the ""stop"" text block. Since the player is at 3 left, 3 down, they need to navigate to 1 left, 2 up. That's a distance of 2 left and 1 up. So moving left twice and up once.

But along the way, are there any stop walls? From 3 left, 3 down:

- Move left once to 2 left, 3 down. Is there a wall there? Looking at the objects, there's a wall at 2 right and 3 up, but that's in the opposite direction. So moving left from 3 left, 3 down would be into open space (no wall mentioned there). Then move left again to 1 left, 3 down. There's a rule `you` at 1 left, 3 down, which is movable. Then move up to 1 left, 2 down. No walls mentioned there. Then move up to 1 left, 2 up, where the ""stop"" rule is.

Once the ""stop"" rule is moved, say, to the right next to the ""key"" rule, then the ""wall is stop"" rule is no longer complete, so walls are not stop. Then the player can move through walls.

But how to move the ""stop"" rule. Since it's a text block, and the rules don't make text blocks stop unless they're part of a stop rule. Since we're in the process of breaking that rule, maybe text blocks are temporarily movable.

Assuming we can move the ""stop"" rule, we can take it to another location. For example, move it to the position of the ""key"" rule, making a new rule like ""key is stop"", but that's not helpful. Or move it to create a new rule that changes stop's property.

Alternatively, move the ""stop"" rule to be part of a new rule like ""push is stop"", but that might not help.

The main goal is to remove the ""wall is stop"" rule so that walls can be moved. So by moving any part of that rule, like the ""stop"" text block, the rule is broken.

Once that's done, the player can move through walls. Then, navigate to the key.

So the steps could be:

1. Move from the player's position (3 left, 3 down) to the ""stop"" rule at 1 left, 2 up.
2. Move the ""stop"" rule to a new location, breaking the ""wall is stop"" rule.
3. Now walls are not stop, so move through them to reach the key.

But how to move the ""stop"" rule. Each move action would be directional. For example, from 1 left, 2 up, moving right to 2 left, 2 up (where the ""wall"" rule is), but that would create ""wall is stop"" again if combined. Alternatively, move the ""stop"" rule down or left.

Alternatively, move the ""stop"" rule to the position of the ""door"" rule, creating a new rule like ""door is stop"", which doesn't affect walls.

But the key is to break the ""wall is stop"" rule. So any movement that separates the three components of that rule would work.

Once the rule is broken, walls are no longer stop. Then, the player can move around them. For example, go around the wall at 3 right and 3 up by moving left past it, since walls are now just regular objects.

From the player's position (3 left, 3 down), after breaking the wall rule, move right to 3 left, 0 down (assuming down steps decrease as you move up). Wait, the directions are a bit confusing. The coordinate system isn't clear. Maybe up and down affect the vertical position, left and right the horizontal.

Assuming that moving up from 3 left, 3 down brings you to 3 left, 2 down, then 1 down, etc. And moving right increases the horizontal position.

The key is at 7 steps right, 3 steps up. So from the player's initial position (assuming they start at 0,0 or some other origin), but the observations list objects relative to the player's position. This is getting a bit too ambiguous without a visual map.

Alternatively, think in terms of the objects listed. The key is 7 steps to the right and 3 steps up from wherever the player is. To get there, need to","

The active rules are ""key is win"", ""wall is stop"", and ""baba is you"". So the goal is to get the key, which is currently defined as win. But the key is 7 steps to the right, and there's a wall (stop) at 3 steps to the right. To reach the key, I need to move right multiple times. But walls are stop, meaning I can't move through them. However, maybe I can manipulate the rules to make the walls passable or change my own properties.

Looking at the objects, there's a rule ""wall is stop"" which is at 2 steps to the left and 2 steps up. If I can move that text block, maybe I can change the wall's property. Also, there are other rules like ""is"", ""stop"", etc. But I need to move them without being stopped by walls.

Since I'm Baba, and ""baba is you"", I can move around. The key is 7 steps to the right, but there's a wall at 3 steps to the right. So moving right directly isn't possible past the wall. I need to either find a way around the wall or change the wall's rule.

Looking at the rules on the left side at 2 steps up, there's ""rule wall is stop"". If I can move ""wall"" and ""stop"" text blocks to create a new rule, like ""stop is nothing"" or ""wall is you"", that might help. Let me check the positions again. The ""wall"" rule is at 2 steps left and 2 steps up, ""is"" is at 1 step left and 2 steps up, and ""stop"" is at 2 steps up. So if I can move ""wall"", ""is"", and ""stop"" together to form a new rule like ""stop is push"" or something, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I can make the wall a non-stop by redefining it. For example, moving ""wall"" to the ""is"" and ""stop"" positions to create ""wall is stop"" again, but that's the same as before. Hmm.

Wait, the key is currently the win condition. So if I grab the key, I win. But getting there is blocked by walls. So perhaps I need to push the walls out of the way. But walls are stop, so I can't push them unless they are redefined. If I can change ""wall is stop"" to ""wall is push"", then maybe I can move them. Let's see where the ""wall"" rule is located. It's at 4 step to the left and 2 step up. The ""is"" is at 3 step left and 2 step up. So to create a new rule like ""wall is push"", I need to move ""wall"" to the ""is"" position and then add ""push"". But I need to check if the required text blocks are available.

Looking at the objects, there's a ""rule `door`"" at 4 steps right and 1 step up, but not sure if that helps. The ""you"" rule is at the bottom left. Maybe I can create a new rule by moving ""baba"", ""is"", and ""you"" to make ""baba is win"", but that might not help because the key is already win.

Alternatively, since ""key is win"", maybe I can just reach the key and touch it, which would satisfy the win condition. But the path is blocked. So perhaps I need to move the wall. To do that, I need to redefine the wall's property. Let's focus on the ""wall is stop"" rule. If I can move that rule somewhere else or break it apart.

The ""wall"" text block is at 4 left and 2 up, ""is"" at 3 left and 2 up, ""stop"" at 2 left and 2 up. So to create a new rule, I need to move these together. If I move ""wall"" to the position of ""is"" and then add ""stop"", but that would still be ""wall is stop"". Maybe instead, move ""stop"" to a different position to create another rule. For example, make ""stop is nothing"" by moving ""stop"" next to ""is"" and ""nothing"", but I don't see a ""nothing"" text block.

Alternatively, use the ""rule `door`"" somehow. Not sure. Another approach: since ""baba is you"", maybe I can turn into the key by making ""baba is key"". If I can create that rule, then I become the key, which is win. To do that, I need to move ""baba"", ""is"", and ""key"" together. The ""baba"" rule is at 4 left and 3 steps down, ""is"" at 3 left and 3 down, ""you"" at 1 left and 3 down. The ""key"" is at 6 right and 3 up. It's a bit far, but maybe possible.

Alternatively, move the ""key is win"" rule somewhere else, but that might break the win condition. Not sure. Let me think step by step.

Current position: The player (Baba) is at the starting position, probably at 0,0 based on the wall positions. The key is at 7 steps to the right. To get there, need to move right 7 times, but walls are blocking. So the key is at (7,0), but there's a wall at (3,0). So moving right from (0,0) to (3,0) is blocked by a wall. So need to find a way around.

Looking at the map layout:

- To the right, there's a wall at 3 steps right and various ups and downs. The door is at 4 steps right and 1 up. The key is at 7 steps right, 3 step up.

Maybe the path goes up around the wall. For example, move up to avoid the wall. Let's check the wall positions:

- Wall at 3 right, 3 up.

- Wall at 3 right, 2 up.

- Wall at 3 right, 1 up.

- Wall at 3 right, 0 up (the main wall blocking the path).

- Wall at 3 right, 1 down, 2 down, etc.

So the vertical line at x=3 has walls from y=1 up to y=3. So to go around, maybe go up to y=1 or y=2, then move right.

But how? The player is at (0,0). To get to x=3, y=1, but that's blocked by a wall. Alternatively, move up to y=1 first, then right. But the wall at x=3, y=1 is a stop. Unless I can push it.

Wait, if I can change the wall's rule to ""push"", then maybe I can push it aside. But how?

The ""wall is stop"" rule is at x=2 left, y=2 up. So to get to that rule, I need to move left and up. The player is at (0,0). To reach x=2 left (which is x=-2), y=2 up, that's a distance of 2 left and 2 up. But the player might not be able to move that far left due to other walls or the map boundaries.

Alternatively, look for other rules. There's a ""rule `door`"" at x=4 right, y=1 up. Not sure if that's useful. The ""rule `baba`"" is at x=4 left, y=3 down. So to reach that area, the player would have to move left and down, but again, possible obstacles.

Alternatively, use the existing rules to create a new rule that allows moving through walls. For example, create ""stop is nothing"". To do that, need the ""stop"" text block and ""nothing"". But ""nothing"" isn't present. Alternatively, ""wall is you"", which would make walls passable since you can move through them if they're defined as you. But how?

If I can create ""wall is you"", then since Baba is you, walking into a wall would let me pass. So to do that, I need to move the ""wall"" text block, ""is"", and ""you"" together. The ""wall"" text is at x=2 left, y=2 up. ""is"" is at x=1 left, y=2 up. ""you"" is at x=2 left, y=3 down. So it's a bit scattered.

The player's current position isn't clear from the observation, but assuming they start at a certain point, maybe near the bottom left. To reach the ""wall is stop"" rule, they would need to move left and up, but there might be walls in the way. For example, at x=3 right, various positions have walls. So moving left from the starting point might be possible if there's a path.

Alternatively, focus on reaching the key by moving around the walls vertically. For example, move up to y=1, then right around the wall at x=3, y=1. But that's blocked. Alternatively, move up to y=2, then right. There's a wall at x=3, y=2, but maybe if I can move past it by redefining.

This is getting complicated. Let me try to outline possible steps:

1. Identify the location of the text blocks needed to redefine rules.
2. Move those text blocks to create a new rule that allows passing through walls or changes the key's win condition.
3. Navigate to the key using the new rule.

Alternatively, since the key is win, maybe touching it is enough, but the path is blocked. So the main obstacle is the wall at x=3 right. If I can make that wall non-stop, then I can move through it.

To make ""wall is not stop"", I need to either delete the ""wall is stop"" rule or replace it with another rule. To delete it, I need to move the text blocks away. But how? If I can move ""wall"", ""is"", and ""stop"" to different positions, breaking the rule.

Alternatively, create a new rule that overrides it. For example, ""wall is push"", which would let me push the wall out of the way. To create that, I need to move ""wall"", ""is"", and ""push"" together. But ""push"" isn't a current rule text block. The available rules are key, is, win, wall, stop, door, baba, you.

Wait, there's a ""rule `door`"" which might have ""door"" as a text block. Maybe use ""door"" instead. But not sure.

Another angle: since ""baba is you"", maybe I can make myself into the key by creating ""baba is key"". Then, since I'm you (Baba), I would be the key, which is win. To do that, I need to move the ""baba"", ""is"", and ""key"" text blocks together.

The ""baba"" rule is at x=4 left, y=3 down. ""is"" is at x=3 left, y=3 down. ""key"" is at x=6 right, y=3 up. That's quite far, but possible with multiple moves.

So the plan would be:

1. Move left to reach the ""baba"" rule area.
2. Gather ""baba"", ""is"", and ""key"" text blocks.
3. Combine them to create ""baba is key"".
4. Then, move to the key (which is now you) and touch it to win.

But this requires navigating past several walls and moving text blocks, which might be tricky.

Alternatively, focus on redefining the wall rule. Let's see:

The ""wall is stop"" rule is at x=2 left, y=2 up. To change this, I need to move ""wall"", ""is"", and ""stop"" to different positions. For example, create ""wall is you"" by moving ""wall"" next to ""is"" and ""you"". The ""you"" is at x=2 left, y=3 down. That's a distance of moving left 2, down 1 from the ""wall is stop"" position. Possible, but requires careful movement.

So steps:

1. Move from starting position to the ""wall is stop"" rule area.
2. Break apart the ""wall is stop"" rule by moving the text blocks.
3. Create a new rule ""wall is you"".
4. Now, walls are passable since you can move through them.
5. Move right past the walls to reach the key.

But how to do this step by step?

First, the player needs to move left and up to reach the ""wall"" text block. Assuming the player starts at (0,0), moving left 2 and up 2 would get to the ""wall"" text at (-2, 2). Then move ""wall"" to the position of ""is"" which is at (-1, 2), and then add ""you"" from (-2,3). But this requires picking up the text blocks and placing them.

Alternatively, move the ""is"" and ""you"" next to ""wall"" to form ""wall is you"".

This is getting quite complex. Given the time constraints, perhaps the best immediate action is to try moving right towards the key, hoping that somehow the walls can be manipulated in the next steps. But previous attempts resulted in failed actions, so maybe the model isn't figuring out the correct sequence.

Another thought: The ""key is win"" rule is at (6,3). If I can move that rule to a different position, but that might not help. Alternatively, create a new rule ""baba is win"" to make Baba the win condition. To do that, gather ""baba"", ""is"", and ""win"" text blocks.

The ""baba"" rule is at (-4, -3), ""is"" at (-3, -3), ""win"" at (7,3). Distance is large, but possible with multiple moves.

Alternatively, focus on the immediate vicinity. The player is likely near the bottom left, given the wall positions. The ""key is win"" rule is far to the right. Maybe the first step is to move right towards the key, but blocked by walls. So need to find a way around.

Alternatively, look for a door. The ""rule `door`"" is at (6,1). If there's a door somewhere, maybe interacting with it opens a path. But the observation doesn't mention a door's state, just its rule.

Another angle: Since the key is the win condition, and it's located at (7,3), maybe the solution is to reach that position. But the path is blocked by walls at (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3). If I can make those walls passable by changing their rule, then proceed.

To change ""wall is stop"" to ""wall is push"", I need to move the text blocks. Assume the player is at (0,0). To reach the ""wall"" text at (-2,2), need to move left 2 and up 2. Then move ""wall"" to the ""is"" position (-1,2), then add ""push"" if available. But ""push"" isn't a text block on the map. Available text blocks are key, is, win, wall, stop, door, baba, you.

Wait, there's a ""rule `door`"" which includes ""door"" text. Maybe use ""door"" as part of a new rule. Not sure.

Alternatively, create ""stop is nothing"". But ""nothing"" isn't present.

Hmm. This is tough. Maybe the intended solution is to push the walls by redefining them as pushable. But without the ""push"" text block, it's tricky.

Alternatively, the key is already defined as win, so maybe just touching it is enough, but the path is blocked. So the real solution must involve redefining the wall rule.

Given the time I've spent and the previous failed actions, perhaps the next best action is to move right towards the key, hoping that in the next step, the model will figure out how to maneuver around the walls by redefining rules. But the previous attempts kept failing, so maybe I need to try a different approach.

Wait, looking at the latest observation, the key is at 7 steps right, 3 step up. The player is likely near the bottom left. The walls to the right are at 3 steps right. So the path is blocked. To go around, maybe move up to 1 step up, then right around the wall. Let's see:

If the player moves up once (to y=1), then they can try to move right past the wall at x=3, y=1. But that's a stop wall. Unless they can push it. If walls are pushable, then pushing them might move them out of the way.

But to push, the wall must be defined as push. So if I can create ""wall is push"", then I can push the wall. To do that, I need to move the ""wall"" text block, ""is"", and ""push"" together. But ""push"" isn't present. However, there's a ""rule `door`"" which includes ""door"". Maybe ""door"" can be used as part of the rule. Not sure.

Alternatively, use the ""door"" rule to create a new rule. For example, ""door is key"", but that doesn't help.

This is really challenging. Given the time I've spent and the need to provide an action, I'll go with moving right, hoping that in the next steps, the model will adjust based on feedback. But since previous right moves have been blocked, maybe a different direction is needed. Perhaps moving up first to avoid the wall.

Alternatively, move up once to y=1, then right. If the wall at x=3, y=1 is stop, then moving right from x=2 to x=3 would be blocked. So maybe move up two steps to y=2, then right.

But without knowing the player's exact position, it's hard to say. The observations show the positions of objects relative to the player, but the player's own coordinates aren't given. Assuming the player is at (0,0), then moving right increases x, up increases y.

Given that, perhaps the best immediate action is to move up to avoid the wall blocking the direct path right. So the action would be ""up"".

Let's try to figure out what to do here. The active rules are ""key is win"", ""wall is stop"", and ""baba is you"". So the key is considered the win condition, which means I need to get the key to win. But I'm Baba, right? Because ""baba is you"" makes me the player.

Looking at the objects, the key is at 7 steps to the right. There's a door at 6 steps to the right, which I guess I need to open with the key. But between me (Baba) and the key, there's a wall at 3 steps to the right. The wall is stop, so I can't go through it. How do I get past the wall?

The key is win, so maybe if I can make the wall not a stop? Maybe by rearranging the rules. Let me check the rules on the map. There's a rule ""wall is stop"" located 2 steps to the left and 2 steps up originally. But in the current observation, the ""wall is stop"" rule is now at 2 steps to the left and 1 step up. Also, there's an ""is"" rule next to it and a ""stop"" rule at 1 step up.

Hmm, maybe I can move the ""wall is stop"" rule away or break it. Since I'm Baba and ""you"", I can move text blocks unless they're stop. The wall itself is stop, but the text blocks (like ""wall"", ""is"", ""stop"") might be movable if they're not part of a stop rule. Wait, the rules are formed by text blocks. So the ""wall is stop"" rule is made of ""wall"", ""is"", and ""stop"" text blocks. If I can move those individual text blocks, I can change the rule.

The ""wall is stop"" rule is at 2 steps left and 1 step up. If I can move the ""stop"" text block somewhere else, maybe I can make the wall not a stop. But how? Let's see where the ""stop"" text block is. In the current observation, the ""stop"" rule is at 1 step up. So maybe if I move the ""stop"" text block away, the ""wall is stop"" rule would no longer be valid. Then walls wouldn't be stop anymore, and I could walk through them.

But to do that, I need to find the ""stop"" text block. It's at 1 step up. If I can move that, but am I allowed to? I'm Baba, which is you, so I can move objects unless they're stop. Wait, the wall is stop, but the text blocks like ""stop"" might not be stop unless they're part of a rule. The ""stop"" text block itself is probably just a regular object unless it's part of a rule. So maybe I can pick up the ""stop"" text block and move it.

So the plan would be: move the ""stop"" text block away from the ""wall is stop"" rule. Then the wall would no longer be stop, allowing me to go through it. Alternatively, create a new rule that makes me not stop. But how?

Alternatively, since the key is win, maybe I can reach the key and take it, even if there's a wall. But the wall is stop, so I can't pass through. Unless I can change the wall's property. If I can remove the ""stop"" property from the wall, then it's just a wall, and I can go around or through it.

Looking at the objects, the ""wall is stop"" rule is composed of the text blocks: ""wall"" at 2 left 1 up, ""is"" at 1 left 1 up, and ""stop"" at 1 up. To break this rule, I need to move one of these text blocks. The ""stop"" text block is at 1 step up. If I can move that to another location, the rule ""wall is stop"" would be destroyed because all parts of the rule need to be together.

So the steps would be: move the ""stop"" text block away. Then the wall is no longer stop, so I can move through it. Once past the wall, grab the key (which is win) and then use it at the door. But how to get to the key?

Wait, the key is at 7 steps to the right. Current position of Baba is at 2 step to the left and 3 steps down, according to the last observation. So to get to the key, which is 7 steps to the right, I need to move right multiple times. But there's a wall at 3 steps to the right. If I can remove the stop property from the wall, then I can go through it.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule that makes Baba immune to stop. For example, ""baba is not stop"" or something. But to do that, I need to find the ""not"" text block, but I don't see it in the current objects. The available text blocks are key, is, win, wall, stop, door, you. So maybe not possible with the current blocks.

Another approach: since the key is win, maybe just grabbing the key (even if I can't get past the wall) would make me win. But how? If the key is considered win, then just standing on it might be enough. Let me check the current position of the key. In the last observation, the key is at 7 steps to the right. If I can move right enough times to reach it, even if there's a wall in the way, but walls are stop. Wait, maybe the key is on the other side of the wall, but if I can make the wall not stop, then I can go through.

So back to moving the ""stop"" text block. The ""stop"" text block is at 1 step up. If I move it down or left, the ""wall is stop"" rule breaks. Let's see where I am. The player (Baba) is at rule `baba` which is 2 step to the left and 3 steps down. So my position is 2 left, 3 down. The ""stop"" text block is at 1 step up. So from my position, how to reach it?

To get to the ""stop"" text block at 1 step up, I need to move up once. But am I allowed to? The path might be clear. Let's see the objects around. There's a wall at 3 steps to the right and 2 step up, but that's not blocking my path up. Wait, my current position is rule `baba` at 2 left 3 down. So to move up, I would go to 2 left 2 down, then 2 left 1 down, then 2 left 0 down (which is 2 left up). But the ""stop"" text block is at 1 step up, which would be 2 left 1 up. Is there a wall there? Looking at the objects, at 2 step to the left and 2 step up, there's a wall. But the ""stop"" is at 1 step up. So moving up from my position:

1. Move up to 2 left 2 down (which is same as 2 left 1 up? Wait, maybe the coordinate system is a bit confusing. Let me clarify.

Assuming that the position is relative to Baba. So ""3 steps to the right and 3 step up"" would be to the right and up from Baba's current position. So when the observation says ""rule `baba` 2 step to the left and 3 steps down"", that means Baba is at the position that is 2 steps left and 3 steps down from the rule `baba` text block. Wait, this is a bit confusing. Maybe it's better to think in terms of directions.

Alternatively, perhaps the map is a grid, and each move changes the position in that grid. But without a visual, it's hard to map. But based on the observations, the key is moving to the right each time I move right, which suggests that the player (Baba) is moving, and the objects are in fixed positions relative to the player.

Wait, no. In Baba Is You, the player can move around, and the text blocks are on the grid. The rules are formed by text blocks placed on the grid. So when the observation says ""rule `key` 5 steps to the right and 3 step up"", that means the text blocks forming the rule ""key is win"" are positioned 5 steps to the right and 3 up from Baba's current position.

So perhaps the player (Baba) is at a certain coordinate, and all other objects are positioned relative to that. So to interact with an object, the player needs to move to the same coordinate as that object.

Given that, the key is at 7 steps to the right and 3 step up from Baba. The wall is at 3 steps to the right, so between Baba and the key. The ""wall is stop"" rule is made of text blocks at 2 left and 2 up from Baba. The ""stop"" text block is at 1 step up from Baba.

So the plan is: move to the position of the ""stop"" text block (1 step up), pick it up, and move it somewhere else to break the ""wall is stop"" rule. Then the wall is no longer stop, and I can pass through it to get to the key.

To do that, I need to navigate from my current position to the ""stop"" text block. My current position is at the ""baba"" rule, which is 2 step left and 3 steps down. So to get to the ""stop"" text block at 1 step up, I need to move up once. But wait, the direction might be relative. If the ""stop"" is 1 step up from Baba's current position, then moving up once should get me there.

But I need to check if there are any obstacles. Let's see the objects around. At 3 steps to the right and 2 step up from Baba, there's a wall. But that's not on the path to the ""stop"" text block, which is 1 step up. So moving up once should be possible.

Once I'm at the ""stop"" text block, I can move it. Since I'm Baba (you), I can move objects that are not stop. The ""stop"" text block itself is just a text block; unless it's part of a stop rule, it can be moved. So moving the ""stop"" text block away would break the ""wall is stop"" rule.

After moving the ""stop"" text block, the wall is no longer stop, so I can walk through it. Then I can go right to the key, pick it up (since key is win), and that should solve the level.

So the steps are:

1. Move up once to reach the ""stop"" text block.
2. Move the ""stop"" text block to a different location (e.g., down or left) to break the ""wall is stop"" rule.
3. Move right past the now non-stop wall to reach the key.
4. Grab the key (which is win) to complete the level.

But the user is asking for the next action based on the current observation. In the last observation before this, after moving up, the new observation shows that the ""wall is stop"" rule is now at 2 step left and 1 step up, and the ""stop"" rule is at 1 step up. So the ""stop"" text block is separate from the ""wall is stop"" rule. Wait, in the current observation, the ""wall is stop"" rule is at 2 step left and 1 step up, composed of ""wall"" at 2 left 1 up, ""is"" at 1 left 1 up, and ""stop"" at 1 up (same position as the ""stop"" rule). So the ""stop"" text block is part of the ""wall is stop"" rule. To break the rule, I need to move any of the three text blocks.

So moving the ""stop"" text block from 1 step up to another position would break the rule. Therefore, the next action should be to move the ""stop"" text block. But how to do that in the game? The allowed actions are move directions: up, down, left, right, or idle.

Wait, but the text blocks are objects on the grid. To move a text block, you have to move it in a direction, which would involve stepping onto it and then moving it. But in the game, you can push objects by moving into them if they are not stop. So if the ""stop"" text block is not part of a stop rule, you can move it.

In this case, since the ""stop"" text block is part of the ""wall is stop"" rule, but the rule is still active, does that make the text blocks stop? Probably not. The text blocks themselves are movable unless they are defined as stop. Since the rule is ""wall is stop"", the wall objects are stop, but the text blocks like ""stop"" are just regular objects unless they are part of a rule that makes them stop. So I can move the ""stop"" text block.

Therefore, the action should be to move the ""stop"" text block. But how to express that in the allowed actions? The actions are up, down, left, right, or idle. To move the ""stop"" text block, I need to move in the direction that pushes it. For example, if the ""stop"" is to my left, I could move left to push it further left.

In the current observation, the ""stop"" rule is at 1 step up. My position is at the ""baba"" rule, which is 2 step left and 3 steps down. So the ""stop"" text block is 1 step up from me. To move it, I need to move in a direction that would push it. For example, if I move up, I would be next to the ""stop"" text block, and then maybe move again to push it further up. But the allowed actions are single steps. So perhaps I need to first move up to get next to the ""stop"" text block, then move again in a direction to push it.

Wait, but the actions are per step. So each action is a single movement. To move the ""stop"" text block, I would have to move into it and then in the next step move again to push it. However, the user is asking for the next action based on the current observation, not multiple steps. So perhaps the first step is to move up to reach the ""stop"" text block.

Looking at the current observation, the ""stop"" rule is at 1 step up. So from my current position (2 left, 3 down), moving up once would place me at 2 left, 2 down (which is 1 step up). Then, if I move up again, I would be at 2 left, 1 down (which is 2 steps up), pushing the ""stop"" text block further up. But I need to check if that's possible.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""stop"" text block by moving in a direction that's adjacent to it. For example, if I move right, maybe I can push it right. But I need to see the layout.

In the current observation, the key is at 7 steps to the right, which is far away. The ""stop"" is at 1 step up. So the immediate next action should be to move up to reach the ""stop"" text block. Once there, I can move it further up or left to break the rule.

So the chosen action is to move up.

Let's try to figure out how to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. The goal is usually to reach the 'WIN' object, which is defined as 'key is win', so getting the key probably opens the door or something.

Looking at the current observation, the active rules are 'key is win' and 'baba is you'. That means I control Baba since 'baba is you', and the key has the 'win' property. So getting the key should make me win. But there are walls labeled 'stop', which are immovable. 

Looking at the objects on the map, the key is at 7 steps to the right and 2 steps down. I need to get there, but there are walls blocking the path. The walls are 3 steps to the right in various positions. Maybe I can move the 'stop' rule to remove the walls' immovable property. 

Wait, the 'stop' rule is 1 step up. If I can move that 'stop' text block somewhere else, maybe I can make the walls not stop. Also, there are rules for 'wall' being 'stop' at the left side. If I can change that, the walls might become movable. 

But how do I move the text blocks? I have to be next to them and move them, but I can only move them if they aren't 'stop' or similar. Wait, the current active rules are 'wall is stop', so any text block that's a 'wall' is stop. Also, 'baba is you' means I can move Baba (which is me) but maybe other objects if I can change the rules. 

Looking at the objects, there's a 'rule `stop` 1 step up'. If I can move that 'stop' rule, maybe I can remove the 'wall is stop' rule. Let me check the positions. The 'stop' rule is 1 step up. If I move it, perhaps to the same spot as the 'wall' rule, then the 'wall' might no longer be stop. 

Alternatively, since 'key is win' is active, maybe I can just grab the key even if there are walls. Wait, but 'wall is stop' means walls block movement. So I need to navigate around or remove the 'stop' property from the walls. 

The key is at 7 right, 2 down. From my current position (assuming I'm at the initial position, maybe?), but the exact position isn't clear. Let me map out the possible path. The walls are at 3 steps right in various directions. The key is two steps down from the rightmost wall. Maybe there's a path down there. 

Alternatively, maybe I can push the 'stop' rule out of the way. If I move the 'stop' rule up or down, the walls might no longer be stop. For example, if I move the 'stop' rule to where the 'wall' rule is, then 'wall is stop' would be replaced, making walls not stop. 

But how to move the 'stop' rule. The 'stop' rule is 1 step up. I need to be adjacent to it and move it. But am I next to it? If the 'stop' rule is 1 step up from my current position, I could move up to get to it. Let's assume my position is somewhere near the lower part. 

Looking at the objects, the 'key' is at 7 right, 2 down. Maybe I need to go down there. But there's a wall at 3 steps right and 1 step down. If I can make that wall not stop, I can move through. 

Alternatively, if I can delete the 'wall is stop' rule, that would help. The 'wall is stop' rule is at 2 steps left and 1 step up. If I can move that rule away, then walls wouldn't be stop anymore. 

But how to reach that rule. The 'wall is stop' rule is at 2 left, 1 up. If I can move towards that position, maybe by moving left and up. But I need to check if I can pass through walls. Since current rules say 'wall is stop', moving into a wall would be blocked. 

This is getting complicated. Maybe a better approach is to first gather all the text blocks needed to create new rules. For example, to make 'baba is you' which I already have, but maybe I need to make 'you' into something else. Wait, the active rules are 'key is win' and 'baba is you'. The 'you' is defined by the rule at 1 step left and 3 steps down (rule `you`). 

If I can make 'baba' into 'win', then touching the key would make me win. But to do that, I need to move the 'is' and 'win' rules to create 'baba is win'. The 'baba' rule is at 2 left, 5 steps down, and the 'is' is at 1 left, 5 steps down, and 'win' is at 8 right, 1 step up. That's far apart. 

Alternatively, maybe I can pick up the 'key' by moving towards it. But the path is blocked by walls. The walls are at 3 right, 1 down and 2 steps down. If I can remove those walls by changing their rules, then I can get to the key. 

Another thought: Since 'key is win', if I can touch the key, does that automatically make me win? Maybe, but I need to reach it. The key is at 7 right, 2 down. Let's see the path. From the current position (assuming I'm at the starting point), maybe moving right and down. But there are walls at 3 right, 1 up, 2 up, etc. 

Wait, the current active rules are 'key is win' and 'baba is you'. So I am Baba, and the key has the 'win' property. In some levels, touching the win object makes you win. So maybe if I can reach the key, that's the solution. 

But how to navigate. The key is at 7 right, 2 down. Let's look at the objects again. The 'door' is at 6 right, 1 down. The 'key' is at 7 right, 2 down. The walls are at 3 right in various positions. The 'stop' rule is 1 step up. 

Maybe I need to move the 'stop' rule out of the way. If I can move the 'stop' rule to somewhere else, then the walls that were 'stop' would no longer be. For example, moving the 'stop' rule to where the 'wall' rule is. 

The 'wall is stop' rule is at 2 left, 1 up. If I can move the 'stop' rule there, then the 'wall' rule would become 'wall is [nothing]', making walls not stop. But how to get the 'stop' rule there. 

The 'stop' rule is currently 1 step up. If I move up to get to it, then I can carry it. But I need to be adjacent. Suppose I'm next to the 'stop' rule. Moving up once would reach it. Then I can move it left or right. 

Alternatively, maybe I can push the 'stop' rule. But I think you can only move text blocks by being adjacent and then moving in a direction, carrying the text block. 

Let me try to outline steps:

1. Move to the 'stop' rule at 1 step up.
2. Pick it up and move it to the 'wall is stop' rule's location (2 left, 1 up), replacing it. This would remove the 'wall is stop' rule, making walls passable.
3. Now, navigate through the walls to the key.

Alternatively, if I can create a new rule that makes 'baba' have the 'win' property. For that, I need 'baba is win'. The 'baba' rule is at 2 left, 5 down, 'is' at 1 left, 5 down, 'win' at 8 right, 1 up. That's quite far apart. Maybe not feasible. 

Another idea: Since 'key is win', perhaps taking the key and placing it somewhere to activate the win condition. But I'm not sure how that works. 

Alternatively, use the 'door' which is at 6 right, 1 down. If I can open the door, maybe that's the exit. But the door's rule is 'door' at 6 right, 1 down. There's no rule defining what the door does except possibly being a target. 

Wait, in some levels, the door is the win condition, but here the active rule is 'key is win', so the key is the win object. 

Maybe the solution is to reach the key. So, let's focus on that. To do that, need to remove the 'stop' property from the walls. 

So, step-by-step:

- Find the 'stop' rule (1 step up).
- Move it to somewhere else, like overwriting the 'wall is stop' rule.
- Now, walls are not stop, so I can move through them.
- Navigate to the key at 7 right, 2 down.

But how to move the 'stop' rule. If I'm next to it, moving up to get there. Suppose I need to move up once to reach the 'stop' rule. Then, once I have it, move left or right to the 'wall is stop' location.

Alternatively, maybe the 'stop' rule is already in a position that allows me to carry it to the 'wall' rule. 

Another thing: The 'you' rule is at 3 steps down. If I can change 'you' to something else, maybe I can become the key or win. But that's more complicated. 

Alternatively, since I am Baba (you), and the key is win, touching the key should make me win. So maybe the key is the target. 

But the problem is the path. Let's see the layout:

- The key is at 7 right, 2 down. There's a wall at 3 right, 1 down and 2 steps down. If walls are stop, I can't go through them. 

If I can remove the 'wall is stop' rule, then I can move through walls. So the critical action is moving the 'stop' rule out of the way. 

So, the plan is:

1. Move to the 'stop' rule (1 step up).
2. Pick it up and move it to the 'wall is stop' rule's location (2 left, 1 up), replacing it.
3. Now, walls are not stop, so navigate to the key.

But how to execute this in the game. Let's check the current observation again. 

The active rules are 'key is win' and 'baba is you'. Objects include the 'stop' rule 1 step up. To get to it, I need to move up. 

In the current observation, after moving 'up' previously, the positions have shifted. The latest observation shows after moving 'up', the 'stop' rule is now 1 step up, the 'key' is at 6 right and 1 step up, etc. 

Wait, in the last observation before the current one, after moving 'up', the 'stop' rule is 1 step up. So if I move 'up' again, I can get to the 'stop' rule. 

But the problem is that when moving up, am I able to pass through walls? The 'wall is stop' rule is still active. The 'stop' rule is a separate text block. So if there's a wall in the way, moving into it would be blocked. 

Wait, the 'wall' objects are separate from the rules. The 'wall is stop' rule defines that any object named 'wall' has the 'stop' property. So even if I move the 'stop' rule, the walls themselves remain, but their immovability depends on the rule. 

So, to move the 'stop' rule, I need to navigate to it without being blocked by walls. Let's see:

In the current observation, the 'stop' rule is 1 step up. If I move 'up', I can reach it. But is there a wall in the way? The walls are at 3 steps right and 1 step up, and other positions. If my current position is, say, at 3 steps right, then moving up would take me to the 'stop' rule's position. But if there's a wall there, I can't. 

Wait, the 'wall' at 3 steps right and 1 step up is a separate object. But the 'stop' rule is at 1 step up. Are they in the same position? Or are they different positions? The observation lists all objects, so the 'stop' rule is at 1 step up, and the wall is at 3 steps right and 1 step up. So they are in different positions. 

Therefore, moving up from my current position (assuming I'm at 3 steps right) would take me to the 'stop' rule's position (1 step up), which is adjacent. Then I can pick up the 'stop' rule and move it. 

So the steps would be:

1. Move up to reach the 'stop' rule.
2. Grab the 'stop' rule and move it left or right to overwrite the 'wall is stop' rule.
3. Now, walls are not stop, so move through them to the key.

But how to execute this in the game. Let's think about the required actions. 

First, check the current position. The 'stop' rule is 1 step up. If I'm currently at the same x-coordinate, moving up once would get me there. 

Assuming I need to move up, then once I have the 'stop' rule, move it to the 'wall is stop' location at 2 left, 1 up. 

So the actions would be:

up (to get to the 'stop' rule)
left (to move to the 'wall is stop' position)
up (or another direction) to place the 'stop' rule there.

But I need to be precise. 

Alternatively, after picking up the 'stop' rule, move left twice to reach the 'wall is stop' rule's position (2 left, 1 up). Then place the 'stop' rule there, replacing the 'wall is stop' with 'stop is [something]'. This would remove the 'wall is stop' rule, making walls passable. 

Once that's done, I can move through the walls to the key. 

So the sequence of actions would be:

1. up (to get to the 'stop' rule)
2. take the 'stop' rule (but how? The actions are move directions. Maybe 'move up' brings me to it, then I need to 'move' in a direction carrying it)
3. move left to the position of the 'wall is stop' rule
4. place the 'stop' rule there, which would replace the existing 'wall is stop' rule
5. now, walls are not stop, so navigate to the key

But the problem is that the actions are limited to moving in directions: up, down, left, right, or idle. The game mechanics require that you can only move text blocks if you are adjacent to them and the block you're moving isn't stop. 

So, to move the 'stop' rule:

- Move up to be adjacent to the 'stop' rule.
- Then, move in a direction (left, right, etc.) while carrying the 'stop' rule. 

Assuming that after moving up, I am adjacent to the 'stop' rule, then moving left (towards the 'wall is stop' location) would carry the 'stop' rule there, replacing the existing rule. 

Once that's done, the 'wall is stop' rule is gone, so walls are no longer stop. 

Then, I can move right past the walls to the key. 

So the actions needed are:

up (to reach 'stop' rule)
left (to move 'stop' rule to the 'wall is stop' position)
right (to go towards the key)

But I need to check the exact positions. 

In the current observation, after moving up previously, the 'stop' rule is 1 step up. The 'wall is stop' rule is at 2 left, 1 up. So moving left from the 'stop' rule's position would take me to 2 left, 1 up, replacing the 'wall is stop' with 'stop' there. 

Once that's done, walls are not stop. Then, I can move right past the walls at 3 steps right to reach the key at 7 steps right, 2 down. 

So the steps are:

1. Move up to get to the 'stop' rule.
2. Move left to place the 'stop' rule over the 'wall is stop' rule.
3. Now, move right, down to reach the key.

But how to translate this into actions. Each action is a single direction. So:

First, to get to the 'stop' rule which is 1 step up. If I'm currently at the same x-coordinate, then 'up' once.

Then, while holding the 'stop' rule, move left to the position of the 'wall is stop' rule. That would be 2 left from the 'stop' rule's position. 

Assuming the 'stop' rule is at (x, y), moving left would take it to (x-1, y). If the 'wall is stop' rule is at (x-2, y), then moving left again would place it there. 

But I need to make sure that the movement is correct. 

Alternatively, once I have the 'stop' rule, moving left once would place it at 2 left, 1 up, replacing the existing 'wall is stop' rule. 

After that, the walls are no longer stop. Then, I can navigate right and down to the key. 

So the sequence of actions would be:

up
left
down
right
right
right
down
down

But I'm not sure. Another approach is to first move up to get the 'stop' rule, then move left to place it, then go right past the walls. 

But I need to output a single action now. The current observation shows that after some moves, the 'stop' rule is 1 step up. So the immediate action should be to move up to reach it. 

Alternatively, if the 'stop' rule is already in reach, moving up would be the first step. 

So the chosen action is 'up' to get to the 'stop' rule.

I need to figure out the correct action to take in this Baba Is You level. Let me start by understanding the current situation based on the observation provided.

First, the active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". That means pressing the key will make me win the level, and since Baba is You, I can interact with other objects by moving them or manipulating the rules.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key located at 7 steps to the right and 2 steps down. The ball is at 4 steps to the right, which might be a red herring because the key is the win condition. There are several walls labeled as stop, which I can't move through unless I change their properties.

The rule blocks are scattered around. The ""stop"" rule is 1 step up, and there are several ""wall"" rules at different positions. The ""baba"" rule is 2 steps to the left and 5 steps down, connected by ""is"" and ""you"" rules. Since I'm Baba (because ""baba is you""), I can move around unless blocked by walls marked ""stop"".

My goal is to reach the key (which is the win object because ""key is win""). But the key is behind a wall at 6 steps right and 1 step up, and another wall at 3 steps right. Wait, no—the key's position is 7 steps to the right and 2 steps down. Let me clarify the map layout.

Let me visualize the grid. Assuming the player's starting position isn't specified, but based on the objects listed, the key is to the right and down from the current position. The walls are spread out, some above, some below, some to the left. The ""door"" rule is at 6 steps right and 1 step down, but I don't know if that's relevant yet.

Since ""baba is you"", I can move freely unless there's a STOP. The walls that are STOP are at specific positions. For example, there's a wall 3 steps right and 1 step up, which is STOP. So I need to navigate around those.

The key is at 7 right, 2 down. To get there, I need to move right and down. The path might be blocked by walls. Let me check the obstacles. From the current position (assuming I'm at the original position, maybe 0,0), moving right 3 steps gets to a wall that's STOP. But maybe I can manipulate the rules to remove the STOP property from those walls.

Looking at the rule blocks, there's a ""stop"" rule 1 step up. If I can move that ""stop"" rule away or replace it, maybe I can make the walls passable. Alternatively, if I can change the ""wall is stop"" rule to something else, that would allow me to walk through walls.

Wait, the active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". The original ""wall is stop"" rule is probably still present but not listed here? Wait, the active rules only show ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". That suggests that the ""wall is stop"" rule might have been altered or removed. Let me check the objects again.

The objects list includes several rule blocks. For example, there's a rule `wall` at 2 steps to the left, and a rule `is` at 1 step to the left. So combining those, it's ""wall is [something]"". But the active rules don't show ""wall is stop"", so maybe that rule has been changed. Perhaps it's now ""wall is key"" or something else. Wait, looking at the objects, rule `win` is at 8 right, 1 up, which is part of ""key is win"". The ""wall"" rule at 2 left might be part of a different rule, like ""something is wall"".

But the active rules only show ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". So the ""wall is stop"" rule must have been removed or overwritten. That's good because if walls are no longer stop, I can walk through them. Wait, but in the previous observations, walls were still stop. Let me check the latest observation.

In the last observation provided, the active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". The objects list includes a rule `stop` at 1 step up, but that's a separate rule. So the ""wall is stop"" rule might have been replaced. For example, if there's a rule ""floor is stop"" or something else, but I need to confirm.

Wait, the objects list has ""rule `stop` 1 step up"". That means there's a standalone ""stop"" rule at that position. But without a subject, that rule might not do much. Active rules are the ones that define properties, like ""wall is stop"". Since ""wall is stop"" isn't in the active rules now, perhaps that rule has been moved or altered.

If ""wall is stop"" is no longer active, then walls aren't stop anymore, meaning I can walk through them. If that's the case, then I can path through the walls to reach the key. Let me verify.

In the current observation's active rules, only ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"" are active. The other rules like ""wall is stop"" must have been moved or changed. For example, if there's a rule ""stop is key"" somewhere, that would mean stop is key, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe the ""wall"" rule is now paired with a different property.

Looking at the objects, there's a rule `wall` at 2 steps to the left, and a rule `is` at 1 step to the left. So combining those, it would be ""[subject] IS wall"", but the subject is missing. Similarly, there's a rule `you` at 5 steps down, connected by ""is"" at 1 step left and 3 steps down. The rule `baba` is at 2 steps left and 5 steps down, so combining with ""is"" and ""you"", that would make ""baba is you"", which is already an active rule.

So perhaps the ""wall is stop"" rule has been moved. Let me check the objects again. There's a rule `stop` at 1 step up, but no subject for it. To make a rule like ""X is stop"", we need a subject and the ""is"" and ""stop"" rules in proximity. Since ""wall is stop"" was an active rule before, maybe it's now broken into its components, like ""wall"" rule somewhere, ""is"" rule somewhere else, and ""stop"" rule somewhere else, so the active rule is no longer formed.

If that's the case, then walls are no longer stop, meaning I can walk through them. So my path to the key at 7 right, 2 down would be possible if I can move around the walls.

But let's look at the specific positions. The key is at 7 right, 2 down. My current position is unclear, but based on the objects, maybe I'm near the lower part of the map. Let's assume I'm at the position of ""rule `baba` 2 step to the left and 5 steps down"", but that's part of the ""baba is you"" rule. Alternatively, maybe I'm at the starting position, which isn't explicitly stated.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to move the ""key is win"" rule to make myself win by touching the key. But since ""key is win"" is already active, touching the key should make me win. So the problem is reaching the key.

The key is at 7 steps right and 2 steps down. To get there, I need to move right and down. Looking at the walls, there's a wall at 3 steps right, which might be a barrier. But if walls are no longer stop, I can walk through them. Alternatively, if there's a STOP rule elsewhere that I need to avoid.

Wait, the objects list includes a ""rule `stop` 1 step up"". If that's the only STOP rule, and it's not attached to any subject, then maybe it's inert. So perhaps walls are not stop anymore, allowing me to pass through them.

In that case, my path to the key would be straightforward: move right past the wall at 3 steps right (since it's not stop), then continue right to 6, 7 steps. Then move down 2 steps.

But wait, the key is at 7 right and 2 down. So from my current position (assuming I'm at the original starting point, maybe 0,0), moving right 7 steps and down 2 steps. But there are walls along the way. For example, at 3 steps right, there's a wall. If I can move through it, then it's okay. Otherwise, I need to find a way around.

Alternatively, maybe I need to retrieve the ""key is win"" rule and move it to the key's position, but that might not be necessary since the rule is already active. Touching the key should suffice.

Another possibility is that the door at 6 steps right and 1 step down is involved. If the door is locked, maybe I need a key, but the key is the win condition, so perhaps touching the key opens the door automatically.

Alternatively, maybe the ""door"" rule is relevant. If I can move the ""door"" rule to the key's position, but that's unclear.

Wait, the active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". So touching the key should make me win. Therefore, the main task is to reach the key.

The key's position is 7 right, 2 down. Let's see the path:

From current position (unknown), but based on the objects, perhaps I'm near the lower part. Let's assume I need to move right and down.

Looking at the walls:

- There's a wall at 3 steps right (at 3 right, 0 down?), but need to check coordinates.

Alternatively, the map's layout might be such that moving right 3 steps brings me to a wall that's stop, but if ""wall is stop"" is no longer active, then I can pass through.

Alternatively, the ""stop"" rule at 1 step up might affect other objects, but not the walls.

This is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to outline the possible steps:

1. Confirm if walls are stop. Since ""wall is stop"" is not an active rule, walls are not stop. Therefore, I can walk through them.

2. The key is at 7 right, 2 down. Need to navigate to that position.

3. Obstacles: walls at 3 steps right and 1 step up, 3 steps right and 1 step down, etc. But if walls are passable, then these are just blocks I can move around.

4. The ""door"" rule is at 6 steps right and 1 step down. Maybe the door is connected to the key. If I have the key, the door opens, but since the key is the win condition, perhaps touching the key is enough.

So the plan is to move right past the walls (since they're not stop) to reach the key's location at 7 right, 2 down.

But how to get there step by step:

- Move right until I reach 7 steps right.

- Then move down 2 steps.

But need to check if there are any STOP rules in the way. The only STOP rule is at 1 step up, which is unrelated.

Therefore, the action should be to move right repeatedly until reaching the key's x-coordinate, then down.

But the problem is that the key is 7 steps to the right and 2 steps down. Assuming the agent's current position is not specified, but based on the objects, maybe the agent is near the lower left part of the map.

Alternatively, perhaps the agent is at the position of the ""baba"" rule, which is 2 steps left and 5 steps down. So to get to the key at 7 right and 2 down, the agent would need to move right (7 - (-2) = 9 steps right?) or maybe the coordinates are relative.

This is getting a bit too ambiguous without a visual map. Let's try to think differently.

Since the key is the win condition, and ""key is win"" is active, the solution is to touch the key. The key is located at 7 steps right and 2 steps down from some position. The obstacles are walls, but if they're not stop, then they can be walked through.

Therefore, the optimal action is to move right and down towards the key. The exact sequence would depend on the agent's current position, but given the observations, the most direct path is to move right first to reach the key's x-coordinate, then down.

Looking at the previous actions, the assistant tried moving right multiple times, but perhaps the agent is still positioned to the left of the key. For example, in the latest observation, after moving up, the agent's position might have changed.

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to retrieve the ""key is win"" rule and place it on the key, but since the rule is already active, that's not necessary.

Another angle: perhaps the ""door"" at 6 steps right and 1 step down is a red herring, and the key is behind it. But since the key's position is 7 right and 2 down, it's past the door.

In summary, the best action is to continue moving right and then down towards the key. Based on the previous successful action of moving up to reach a certain position, perhaps moving right again is the next step.

Let's see. I need to figure out how to solve this Baba Is You level. Let's start by understanding the current situation based on the observation provided.

The active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". That means whatever has the ""key"" property is now the target to win, and Baba is the player character. So, I need to get the key to win. The key is located 7 steps to the right and 1 step up from my current position. Wait, but looking at the objects on the map, there's a key at 5 steps to the right and 1 step up? Hmm, maybe I need to check the map again.

Looking at the objects list:

- rule `stop` 1 step to the left and 1 step up
- wall 2 steps to the right and 1 step up
- rule `key` 5 steps to the right and 1 step up
- rule `is` 6 steps to the right and 1 step up
- rule `win` 7 steps to the right and 1 step up
- rule `wall` 3 step to the left
- rule `is` 2 step to the left
- wall 2 steps to the right
- ball 3 steps to the right
- wall 2 steps to the right and 1 step down
- rule `door` 5 steps to the right and 1 step down
- wall 2 steps to the right and 2 steps down
- key 6 steps to the right and 2 steps down
- wall 2 steps to the right and 3 steps down
- wall 2 steps to the right and 4 steps down
- rule `baba` 3 step to the left and 5 steps down
- rule `is` 2 step to the left and 5 steps down
- rule `you` 1 step to the left and 5 steps down
- wall 2 steps to the right and 5 steps down

Hmm, there are two keys mentioned here. One at 5 steps right, 1 step up, and another at 6 steps right, 2 steps down. But the active rule is ""key is win"", so whichever key is present on the map is the target. But the key's position might be blocked by walls or other stop properties.

Let me visualize the grid. The player (Baba) is likely at the starting position, which isn't explicitly mentioned, but based on the objects, maybe at position (0,0) or similar. The key at 5 steps right and 1 step up would be in a position that's accessible? But there's a wall 2 steps to the right and 1 step up. Also, there's a rule `stop` 1 step left and 1 step up, which might be a text block making something stop.

The wall is defined as ""stop"", so any object with the ""wall"" property cannot be moved. The player can move objects that aren't stopped. Since Baba is ""you"", I can move Baba by moving left, right, up, or down, but only if the path isn't blocked by a wall or a stop rule.

The key is at 5 steps right, 1 step up. So from my current position (assuming I'm at the starting point, maybe 2 steps left and 5 steps down?), I need to navigate to that key. But there's a wall at 2 steps right and 1 step up. Wait, the wall is 2 steps to the right and 1 step up. So if I'm trying to go up from my current position, I might hit that wall. Let's think: if I'm at position (0,0), then moving right to (2,0), then up to (2,1) would hit the wall at (2,1). So that path is blocked.

Alternatively, maybe there's another way around. Let's check the layout again. The rule `stop` is at 1 left, 1 up. So that's (-1,1) if I'm at (0,0). Then the wall is at (2,1). So between me and the key at (5,1), there's a wall at (2,1). How can I get past that?

Since walls are stop, I can't push them unless they're not stopped. Wait, the rule ""wall is stop"" means that any object labeled as wall has the stop property. So unless there's a rule that changes that, I can't move the wall. So I need to find another path.

Looking at the other objects: there's a ball at (3,0), which isn't a wall or stop. Maybe I can use that to create a new rule? But to do that, I need to move text blocks. The text blocks are ""key"", ""is"", ""win"", ""wall"", ""stop"", ""door"", ""baba"", etc.

The rule `key` is at (5,1), `is` at (6,1), `win` at (7,1). So if I can get to those text blocks, I might rearrange the rules. For example, if I can make ""baba"" as ""win"" or ""key"", that could change the win condition. But the current rule is ""key is win"", so the key is the win object.

Alternatively, if I can make ""Baba"" be ""win"", then reaching Baba would win the level. Since there's a rule `baba` at (3,5) (assuming positions are relative), but it's 3 steps left and 5 steps down from somewhere. Wait, the rule `baba` is at 3 steps left and 5 steps down from the current observer's position. Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I need to track the positions more carefully.

Alternatively, perhaps I should focus on moving the key to a different location. Since the key is at (5,1), and I need to get it to a position where it's not blocked. But how? The key is a movable object unless it's stopped. The key's property is determined by the rule ""key is win"", so it's a win object but not necessarily stopped. Wait, the rule ""wall is stop"" applies to walls, not keys. So the key can be moved.

So if I can move the key from (5,1) to a different spot, maybe closer to me. But to do that, I need to move it left or right, but are there any walls blocking its movement? At (5,1), the key is adjacent to the `is` text block at (6,1) and the `win` text block at (7,1). Also, there's a wall at (2,1), but that's further left.

Wait, the key is at (5,1). To move it left, I would need to go to (4,1), but is there a wall there? Looking at the objects, there's a wall at (2,1), but nothing mentioned at (3,1) or (4,1). So maybe I can move the key left by first moving the `is` and `win` text blocks out of the way. But how?

Each text block is an object that can be moved unless they're part of a stop rule. Since ""wall"" is stop, but other text blocks like ""is"", ""key"", etc., are not stopped unless specified. So I can move the `is` at (6,1) and `win` at (7,1) by moving them left or right. For example, move the `is` from (6,1) to (5,1), then the key can move to (6,1). But I need to be in the position to do that.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule that changes the stop property. For example, if I can make ""stop is wall"", that would remove the stop property from walls, allowing them to be moved. But to do that, I need to move the existing `stop` text block and rearrange the rules.

The `stop` rule is at (1 left, 1 up) from the current position. So if I can move that `stop` text block away, then I could redefine other properties. Let's see:

1. Move right to reach the `stop` text block at (-1,1) (assuming current position is (0,0)).
2. Then, move the `stop` text block to a different location, say, to the right, so that it's no longer affecting the walls.
3. Once `stop` is moved, perhaps walls are no longer stopped, allowing me to push them out of the way.

But this seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to use the `baba` text blocks to create a new rule. The rule `baba` is at (3 step left and 5 steps down), which would be (-3, -5) from (0,0). If I can move that `baba` text block next to ""is"" and ""you"", I could create a new rule like ""baba is you"" (which is already the case) or ""baba is win"".

Wait, the current active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". The `you` rule is at (1 step left and 5 steps down) from the current position. So if I can move the `baba` text block next to `is` and `you`, I could create a new rule. For example, moving `baba` to be adjacent to `is` and `you` would form ""baba is you"", which is already active. Not helpful.

Alternatively, if I can move `baba` next to `win`, then create ""baba is win"", which would make reaching Baba the win condition. That might be a way to win the level. But how to do that?

The `baba` text block is at (-3, -5). To get to that position, I would need to move left and down multiple times, but there are walls blocking the way. For example, at (2 steps right and 3 steps down) there's a wall, and so on. This path might be blocked.

Alternatively, maybe focus on moving the key. Since the key is at (5,1), and I need to get it to a position where I can take it. But the path is blocked by the wall at (2,1). Unless I can move that wall. But the wall is stopped, so I can't move it unless I change the stop rule.

Another approach: Since the key is the win object, maybe I don't need to physically pick it up, but just reach its location. But the rule says ""key is win"", so I think you have to be on the key or move it to your position. Wait, in Baba Is You, usually, the win condition is to touch the object defined as win. So if the key is win, I need to touch the key.

So, to touch the key at (5,1), I need to navigate there. But the path is blocked by the wall at (2,1). So how to get past the wall?

If I can make the wall not a stop, then I can move around it. To do that, I need to change the rule ""wall is stop"" to something else. For example, make ""stop is door"" or remove the ""stop"" property from wall.

The `stop` rule is at (-1,1). If I can move that `stop` text block away, then walls would no longer be stopped. Let's see:

1. Move up to reach the `stop` text block at (-1,1).
2. Then move the `stop` text block left or right, say to (-1,2), so it's no longer affecting the wall at (2,1).
3. Now, the wall at (2,1) is just a regular wall (since ""wall is stop"" rule is removed), so I can push it or move around it.

But how to move the `stop` text block? To move it, I need to be adjacent to it and move in a direction. Let's assume my current position is (0,0). The `stop` is at (-1,1). So I need to move left and up to get there. But can I?

From (0,0), moving left once gets to (-1,0). Then up to (-1,1), which is the `stop` text block. Now, I can move the `stop` block. Let's say I move it up to (-1,2). Then the rule ""stop is..."" would be moved, and the original wall at (2,1) is no longer stopped, so I can move around it.

Once the wall is no longer stopped, I can go around it to reach the key. Let's outline the steps:

1. Move left to (-1,0).
2. Move up to (-1,1) to grab the `stop` text block.
3. Move up again to (-1,2) to place the `stop` rule elsewhere, removing the ""wall is stop"" rule.
4. Now, walls are no longer stopped. Go around the wall at (2,1) by moving right past it.
5. Head towards the key at (5,1).

But wait, after moving the `stop` rule, do the existing walls lose their stop property? Yes, because the rule that made them stop (""wall is stop"") is no longer present. So walls can now be moved.

So now, the wall at (2,1) is just a regular wall, so I can push it or move around it. Let's say I move around it by going right past (2,1) to (3,1), (4,1), etc., towards the key at (5,1).

Once I reach the key at (5,1), since it's the win object, touching it should win the level. So the final steps would be:

- Move to (5,1) by going around the now-movable wall.

But let's verify the movement step-by-step:

Starting position: Let's assume I'm at (0,0) based on the objects' positions. The key is at (5,1), wall at (2,1), `stop` at (-1,1).

1. Move left to (-1,0).
2. Move up to (-1,1) (grabbing the `stop` text block).
3. Move up to (-1,2) (placing the `stop` rule elsewhere, say above).
4. Now, walls are no longer stopped. The wall at (2,1) can be moved.
5. From (0,0), move right to (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), etc., but need to navigate around the wall at (2,1). Since the wall is now movable, can I push it?

Wait, to push a wall, I need to be adjacent to it and move in the same direction as the wall. So from (2,0), I can move up to (2,1), which is the wall, and then move further up, but I can't because pushing requires being next to it and moving away. Alternatively, since the wall is now just a regular object (not stopped), I can move it aside.

But moving the wall might be necessary to clear the path. For example:

- From (2,0), move up to (2,1) (the wall).
- Then move up again to (2,2), pushing the wall from (2,1) to (2,2).
- Now, the path to the key is clear.

But this requires that the wall can be moved, which it can now since the stop rule is removed.

So after step 4, the steps would be:

5. Move right to (1,0).
6. Move right to (2,0).
7. Move up to (2,1) (the wall).
8. Move up to (2,2), pushing the wall to (2,2).
9. Now, from (2,2), move right to (3,2), (4,2), etc., towards the key at (5,1).

Wait, but the key is at (5,1), which is one step down from (5,2). So after pushing the wall, moving right from (2,2) to (5,2), then down to (5,1), which is the key's position.

Once I'm at (5,1), touching the key (which is the win object) should complete the level.

Alternatively, maybe there's a shorter path. Let's see:

After step 4 (having moved the `stop` rule), from (0,0):

- Move right to (1,0).
- Move right to (2,0).
- Move up to (2,1) (the wall), but since it's movable, I can move it out of the way first.
- Push the wall from (2,1) to (2,2) by moving up from (2,0) to (2,1) and then up to (2,2).
- Then move right to (3,1), (4,1), (5,1).

Yes, that makes sense. So the sequence of moves would involve moving the `stop` rule, then pushing the wall, then going right to the key.

But how to execute this in the game? Each move is a single step, so I need to plan the exact path.

Alternatively, maybe there's a quicker way. If I can directly move the key to a position where I can reach it without obstacles. But the key is at (5,1), and I need to get there. Let's see:

If I can move the `key` text block from (5,1) to a nearby spot. For example, move the `key` left to (4,1), but there's no wall there. So:

1. Move to (5,1) (the key's position).
2. Grab the key and move it left to (4,1).

But to do that, I need to be adjacent to the key. From where?

Assuming I'm at (0,0), I need to navigate to (5,1). But the path is blocked by the wall at (2,1). Unless I move the `stop` rule first.

So the steps would still involve moving the `stop` rule, then pushing the wall, then moving right to the key.

Alternatively, maybe there's a different rule to change. For example, if I can make ""key is you"", then I would be the key and touching myself would win. But to do that, I need to create the rule ""baba is key"" or ""baba is you"" alongside ""key is you"". Wait, the current rule is ""baba is you"", so if I can make ""key is you"", then both Baba and the key are you, and touching either would win. But how?

The `key` text block is at (5,1), `is` at (6,1), so if I can move `baba` next to `is` and `you`, I could create ""b","

Let's try to figure out what to do here. The active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". So, if I can get the key, it becomes the win condition, right? Or maybe since key is already win, grabbing it would make me win. Let me check the objects on the map.

Looking at the objects, there's a key at 6 steps to the right and 2 steps down. To reach that key, I need to move right several times and down. But the walls are labeled as ""stop"", so I can't move through them. Wait, the rules say ""wall is stop"", so any object marked as wall can't be moved through. But I, being Baba, can move unless there's a wall in the way.

First, where am I currently located? The observation doesn't explicitly state my position. Hmm, maybe I need to infer it based on the rules and objects. The rules ""baba is you"" are present, so I must be the Baba object. Looking at the objects, there's a rule `baba` at 3 steps to the left and 5 steps down. Wait, but how does that relate to my position? Maybe I'm at the same position as the ""baba"" rule? Or perhaps not. Maybe the Baba entity is a separate object that I control. This part is a bit confusing without explicit position information.

Assuming I need to move towards the key, which is at 6 steps right and 2 down. Let's see the path. From my current position (unknown), moving right multiple times towards the key. But there are walls in the way. Let me map out the obstacles.

Looking at the objects:

- There's a wall at 3 steps to the left. But if I'm moving right, that's not in my path.
- Walls at 2 steps to the right and various down positions. For example, wall at 2 right, 1 step down; 2 right, 2 steps down, etc. The key is at 6 right and 2 down. So moving right from 2 to 6 would require passing through steps that may have walls.

Wait, the key is at 6 steps to the right and 2 steps down. The wall at 2 steps right and 2 steps down is directly below the key. So to get to the key, I need to move down from the position above the wall at 2 steps right, 2 steps down. But how do I get there?

Alternatively, maybe there's a door at 5 steps right and 1 step down. Wait, the rule `door` is there. Doors might be passable unless there's a stop rule. But the active rules don't mention door being stop, so maybe I can go through doors.

Let me think step by step. My goal is to reach the key, which is win. So I need to navigate to the key's position. Let's assume I'm starting somewhere near the initial rules. The initial setup had rules like ""key is win"" on the right side. Maybe I'm positioned to the left of those rules.

Looking at the objects again, the rule `baba` is at 3 steps left and 5 steps down. That might be where the Baba entity is located. So if I'm at that position, how do I move to the key?

From 3 left and 5 down, to get to 6 right and 2 down, I need to move right 9 steps and up 3 steps. But there are walls blocking the path. For example, at 2 steps right and 1 step up, there's a wall. Also, at 2 right and 1 down, wall. So moving right directly might hit a wall.

Alternatively, maybe I can move around the walls. Let's see:

Current position (assuming at rule `baba`'s location: 3 left, 5 down).

To get to the key at 6 right, 2 down:

Possible path:

1. Move up from 5 down to 4 down, 3 left.
2. Check if there's a wall. At 3 left, 4 down: objects? Not listed, so maybe open.
3. Continue up to 3 down, 3 left.
4. Move right to 4 left, 3 down. Is there a wall? At 2 right and 1 step down, there's a wall. Wait, the walls are at various positions. Let me check:

Walls listed:

- 1 step to the left and 1 step up (relative to where?)
- 2 steps right and 1 step up
- 2 steps right and 1 step down
- 2 steps right, 2 steps down, etc.

This is getting complicated without a visual map. Maybe the best approach is to move towards the key incrementally, checking for walls.

Another angle: since ""key is win"", maybe I don't need to pick up the key, but just be near it? But usually, you have to interact with it. Alternatively, maybe I can redefine the rules. For example, if I can make ""baba is win"", then just standing there would win. But how?

To do that, I need to move the ""win"" text block. The ""win"" rule is at 7 steps right and 1 step up. If I can move that to be ""baba is win"", then I win. But to move the text blocks, they can't be marked as ""stop"". The current rules have ""wall is stop"", so any object named wall is stop. Other objects like ""is"", ""you"", ""key"", ""win"", ""door"" might be movable.

So, the plan could be:

1. Move to the ""win"" rule at 7 right, 1 up.
2. Move left to attach it with ""baba"" and ""is"" to form ""baba is win"".

But to do that, I need to navigate past walls. Let's see:

Current position (assuming near the ""baba"" rule at 3 left, 5 down). Need to get to 7 right, 1 up.

Path options:

Maybe move up first from 5 down to 4 down, then right towards the ""win"" rule. But there's a wall at 2 steps right and 1 step down. Wait, the walls are at various positions. Let's list all walls:

- 1 step to the left and 1 step up (relative to where? Maybe the starting point)
- 2 steps right and 1 step up
- 2 steps right and 1 step down
- 2 steps right, 2 steps down
- 2 steps right, 3 steps down, etc.

This is tricky. Alternatively, perhaps moving towards the key is still the way to go. Let's try to move right from the current position (3 left, 5 down) to 6 right, 2 down.

But moving right from 3 left would actually be moving towards the right direction. Wait, the directions are relative. If the ""baba"" rule is at 3 steps left and 5 steps down, that might mean my position is somewhere else, and the rules are placed relative to me.

This is getting too ambiguous without knowing my exact position. Maybe I should focus on moving right towards the key, avoiding walls. For example, if I move right once, then up to bypass a wall.

Alternatively, since the key is 6 right and 2 down, and I'm at 3 left and 5 down, perhaps moving right 9 times and up 3 times. But there are walls along the way.

Alternatively, look for a door to pass through. The door is at 5 steps right and 1 step down. If I can reach there, maybe I can go through it.

But how to get there? Let's see:

From 3 left, 5 down:

- Move right to 4 left, 5 down.
- Move right to 5 left, 5 down. Is there a wall here? At 2 steps right and 1 step down, there's a wall. Wait, the walls are at specific positions. Maybe at 5 left, 5 down, there's no wall. Not sure.

This is really challenging without a clear map. Let's try to think of possible valid actions. The possible actions are idle, up, down, left, right.

Given the previous actions were right, left, up, etc., and the game defaulted to idle when invalid actions were given, maybe I need to find a valid direction that's not blocked by walls.

Looking at the latest observation, the active rules are still ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". The objects include a key at 6 right, 2 down, and walls at various positions.

Assuming I'm currently next to a movable object, maybe I can move right towards the key, avoiding walls. For example, if moving right doesn't hit a wall, then that's a valid action.

Alternatively, since the key is the win condition, maybe the solution is to reach it, but the path is blocked by walls. So perhaps I need to move the ""win"" rule to associate with Baba.

To do that, I need to grab the ""win"" text block and move it to create ""baba is win"". The ""win"" rule is at 7 right, 1 up. The ""is"" rule is at 6 right, 1 up. The ""baba"" rule is at 3 left, 5 down. So to form ""baba is win"", I need to move ""win"" next to ""baba"" and ""is"".

This would require moving the ""win"" block from 7 right, 1 up to, say, 4 left and 5 down (assuming my position is there). But this seems complex.

Alternatively, maybe I can push the ""win"" rule to the left by moving leftwards, but I need to check if the path is clear.

Another approach: since ""key is win"", if I can make Baba into the key, then Baba would be win. To do that, move the ""key"" text block next to ""baba"" and ""is"".

The ""key"" is at 5 right, 1 up. The ""is"" is at 6 right, 1 up. So forming ""baba is key"" would make Baba the key, and since key is win, then Baba would be win.

So steps would be:

1. Move to the ""baba"" rule at 3 left, 5 down.
2. Move right to 4 left, 5 down.
3. Continue moving right until reaching the ""is"" rule at 6 right, 1 up. But this path is blocked by walls.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe the simplest valid action at this point, given the observations, is to keep moving right towards the key, assuming that eventually I'll find a path. Alternatively, try moving up to avoid walls.

In the latest observation, after moving up, the key is now at 7 right, 1 step up (but the observation shows after moving up, the key's position might have shifted). Wait, no, the key's position is still at 6 steps right and 2 down in the previous observation, but after moving up, perhaps the grid shifts.

I think I'm stuck here. Given the time I've spent and the previous failed attempts, maybe the best valid action is to keep moving right towards the key, assuming there's a path.

70,right,"<reasoning>
Let me try to figure out what to do here. The active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". So, normally, the goal would be to get the key because it's defined as win. But I need to check if there's any other way to win or if I need to manipulate the rules.

Looking at the objects, the key is pretty far to the right, at 5 steps to the right and 2 steps down. But there are walls in the way. The walls are marked as stop, so I can't move through them. The ball is near the key, but I don't know if that's useful yet.

Wait, the rule ""key is win"" means that if I can get to the key, I win. So my goal is to reach the key. But the path is blocked by walls. The only way to get past walls is if they're no longer stop. But the rule ""wall is stop"" was active earlier, but now it's not listed. Wait, looking at the current active rules, it's only ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". So the wall's property might have changed. How?

Oh, maybe I need to move the ""wall"" rule text blocks. The rules ""wall is stop"" must have been moved or deleted. Let me check the objects on the map. There's a rule `wall` at 4 steps to the left. Let me parse that. So the rule is ""wall is [something]"". Wait, the object is a rule `wall`, but what's it paired with? The rule `is` is at 3 steps to the left, and `stop` is at 2 steps to the left and 1 step up. Hmm, maybe the rule ""wall is stop"" was broken apart. So the current active rules don't include ""wall is stop"" anymore. That means walls are no longer stop? Or their property might have changed. Wait, the active rules only show ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". So perhaps the ""wall is stop"" rule was deleted, making walls not stop anymore. That would mean I can move through them?

Wait, but the objects on the map include walls. For example, wall 1 step to the right and 1 step up. If walls are no longer stop, then I can walk through them. But I need to confirm. The active rules don't have ""wall is stop"", so maybe walls are now a different property. But the default for walls in Baba Is You is that they are stop. If the rule is removed, then perhaps they are just a normal object. So maybe I can move through them now.

If that's the case, then I can path through the walls to get to the key. Let's see the layout. Starting from the player's position (assuming I'm Baba, since ""baba is you""), I need to move right past the walls. The walls are at various positions. For example, wall 1 step to the right, then another at 1 step right and 1 step up, etc. If I can move right past these, then maybe I can reach the key.

But how do I know where I am exactly? The observation doesn't explicitly state the player's position. It lists other objects but not the player. Hmm, maybe I need to infer the player's position based on the rules and other objects. Alternatively, perhaps the player is at a default starting point, like the bottom-left corner.

Assuming I need to move right to reach the key at 5 steps right and 2 steps down. Let's check the path. From the player's position (unknown), moving right towards the key. There's a wall at 1 step right, then another at 1 step right and 1 step up. But if walls are no longer stop, I can walk through them. So the plan would be to move right past these walls.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to change another rule. For example, if I can make ""key is you"", then the key becomes the player, and I can push or move it. But to do that, I need to manipulate the text blocks. The key is at 5 steps right and 2 steps down, with a rule `key` there. The `is` rule is at 5 steps right and 1 step up, and `win` is at 6 steps right and 1 step up. So if I can move the `is` and `win` blocks to create a new rule like ""baba is win"" or something else.

Wait, the active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". So maybe I need to create a new rule that changes the win condition. For example, making ""baba is win"" so that reaching Baba (myself) would win. But how? To do that, I need to move the `baba`, `is`, and `win` text blocks together.

Looking at the objects, there's a rule `baba` at 4 steps left and 5 steps down, `is` at 3 steps left and 5 steps down, and `you` at 2 steps left and 5 steps down. So if I can bring those together to form ""baba is you"", but that's already an active rule. Alternatively, move `baba`, `is`, and `win` to make ""baba is win"".

But how to move them? The player (Baba) can move if they are the ""you"" object, which they are. So the plan is to move the `baba`, `is`, and `win` text blocks adjacent to each other to create ""baba is win"", making Baba the win condition. Then, I just need to reach my own position, which would make me win.

So the steps would be:

1. Move towards the `baba`, `is`, and `win` text blocks located at the lower left (4 left, 5 down; 3 left, 5 down; and 6 right, 1 up). Wait, no, the `win` is at 6 steps right and 1 step up. That's on the upper right. The `baba` rule is at 4 left and 5 down. So those are in opposite corners. To connect them, I need to move the `win` rule block to the area where `baba` and `is` are.

But the `win` rule is at 6 steps right and 1 step up, which is near the key. To get there, I might have to navigate past the walls. But if walls are no longer stop, that's possible.

Alternatively, maybe there's a door at 4 steps right and 1 step down. If the door is a stop or not, but since ""wall is stop"" is not active, maybe doors are passable. But I'm not sure. The rule `door` is present, but without a corresponding property, it might just be a static object.

This is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to outline possible actions:

Option 1: Navigate to the key directly by moving right, ignoring walls since they're no longer stop. But need to confirm if walls are passable.

Option 2: Create a new rule ""baba is win"" by moving the `baba`, `is`, and `win` blocks together. This would make reaching myself (Baba) the win condition, which is trivial since I'm already there. But how to form the rule?

To create ""baba is win"", I need to have the `baba` text block, then `is`, then `win` all adjacent. The current positions are:

- `baba`: 4 left, 5 down
- `is`: 3 left, 5 down
- `win`: 6 right, 1 up

So they're spread out. I'd need to move the `win` block all the way to the left to be next to `baba` and `is`. That would require moving left multiple times, passing through areas. But if walls are passable, this might be feasible.

Alternatively, maybe there's a shorter path. Let's see:

Current player position: Not explicitly stated, but assuming the starting point is somewhere. Let's assume the player is at the bottom-left, needing to move right and up.

To reach the `win` block at 6 right, 1 up, the player would have to move right 6 times and up 1. But there are walls along the way. For example, at 1 step right, there's a wall. But if walls are passable, then moving right through them is okay.

Alternatively, moving up first to avoid walls. For example, move up to avoid the wall at 1 step right, then right, then down.

But this is all speculative. The key is to determine the valid actions based on the current rules.

Since the active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"", and assuming walls are no longer stop, the immediate goal could be to reach the key. However, the key is at 5 steps right and 2 steps down. The player's position isn't given, but looking at the objects, perhaps the player is near the lower part.

Looking at the objects:

- rule `stop` at 2 left, 1 up
- wall at 1 right, 1 up
- rule `key` at 4 right, 1 up
- rule `is` at 5 right, 1 up
- rule `win` at 6 right, 1 up
- etc.

If the player is starting at, say, position (0,0), then moving right to reach the key would involve moving past the wall at 1 right, 1 up. But if walls are passable, then moving right through them is allowed.

So the action would be to move right repeatedly until reaching the key. However, the previous attempts had the assistant moving right multiple times, but the environment seems to be shifting the positions of the rules as they move, which might mean that moving right pushes the rules to the left? Or maybe the coordinates are relative.

This is confusing without knowing the exact grid layout. But given the observations, the latest one shows that after moving up, the positions of the rules have shifted. For example, after moving up, the `stop` rule is now 2 steps to the left and 1 step up, whereas before it was 1 step up.

In any case, the critical point is that the walls are no longer stop, so the player can move through them. Therefore, the best action is to move towards the key by going right, as that's the direction of the win condition.

So the chosen action is right.

71,Failed to obtain a valid action from the reasoning.,"<reasoning>
Let's try to figure out what the correct action should be here. The goal is to get to the 'win' object, which is currently the key. The active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". Since Baba is me, I need to manipulate the rules to reach the key, which is acting as the win condition.

Looking at the objects, the key is 5 steps to the right and 1 step up from where I am. But there are walls blocking the path. The walls are defined as 'stop', so I can't move through them. The rule 'key is win' means that touching the key will make me win. But how do I get around the walls?

I see some text blocks on the map. The 'stop' rule is at 3 steps left and 1 step up. Maybe I can move that 'stop' rule away or change it. Also, there's a 'door' rule at 3 steps right and 1 step down. Not sure if that's useful yet. 

The key is to either move the walls out of the way or alter the rules to make the walls passable. Since I'm Baba and 'baba is you', I can push objects that aren't stopped. Wait, but the walls are 'stop', so I can't push them. Hmm.

Looking further, there's a 'rule `baba`' at 5 steps left and 5 steps down. If I can move that 'baba' rule closer, maybe I can change my own property. But how? I need to move the text blocks 'baba', 'is', and 'you' to form a new rule. For example, if I can create ""BABA IS WIN"", then I would be the win object and standing on the key would automatically win. 

But to do that, I need to collect the 'win' text block. The 'win' rule is currently attached to the key. If I can separate them and move 'win' to Baba, that might work. Let's see the positions:

- 'key' is at 3 steps right, 1 step up.
- 'is' is at 4 steps right, 1 step up.
- 'win' is at 5 steps right, 1 step up.

So the current rule is ""key is win"". To make ""baba is win"", I need to move 'baba' text block (which is at 5 left, 5 down) near these. But that's far away. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to move the existing 'is' and 'win' to attach to 'baba'.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the 'stop' rule away so I can path through. The 'stop' is at 3 left, 1 up. If I can move that 'stop' rule somewhere else, like next to a wall, then the wall might no longer be stop. But how to move the 'stop' rule? I need to be adjacent to it and move it in a direction, but I can only move objects that aren't 'stop'. Wait, the 'stop' rule itself is a text block. Since I'm 'you' (Baba), can I move the 'stop' text block? The rule says 'wall is stop', so walls are stop, but text blocks aren't necessarily stop unless specified. So maybe I can move the 'stop' text block.

So, if I move the 'stop' rule to a different position, the wall it was modifying might lose the 'stop' property. For example, the wall at 1 step up is currently under the 'stop' rule. If I move 'stop' away, that wall might no longer be stop, allowing me to pass.

Looking at the current layout, the wall at 1 step up is next to the 'stop' rule at 3 left, 1 up. If I move the 'stop' rule to, say, 1 step up's position, then that wall would no longer be stop. Let's check:

The 'stop' rule is at 3 left, 1 up. If I move it right by 2 steps to 1 step up's position (0 left, 1 up), then the wall at 1 step up would no longer be stop. Then I could move past it to the key.

But how to move the 'stop' rule? I need to be adjacent to it and move it. The 'stop' rule is 3 steps to the left and 1 step up from my current position. Wait, where am I located? Looking at the objects, the player (Baba) is at the position of the 'baba' rule, which is at 5 left and 5 down. Wait, no, the 'baba' rule is a text block, not necessarily the player's position. The player is Baba, so the player's position is where the 'baba' object is. But in the current observation, the 'rule `baba`' is at 5 left and 5 down. So the player is at that position. 

So to reach the 'stop' rule at 3 left, 1 up, I need to move left and up. But the path is blocked. Let's see:

From the player's position (5 left, 5 down), to get to the 'stop' rule at 3 left, 1 up, the directions would be left twice and up four times. But the way is blocked by walls. For example, moving up from the player's position (5 left,5 down) to 5 left,4 down, then 5 left,3 down (a wall), etc. So that's not feasible.

Alternative approach: Maybe push a wall? But walls are 'stop', so I can't. Unless I change the 'wall is stop' rule. If I can remove 'wall is stop', then walls become passable. To do that, I need to move the 'stop' rule away from the 'wall' rule. 

The 'wall' rule is at 5 left, and the 'stop' rule is at 3 left,1 up. So the current rule is ""wall is stop"" formed by those two. If I can separate them, then the wall would no longer be stop. 

To move the 'stop' rule, I need to be adjacent to it. The 'stop' rule is at 3 left,1 up. The player is at 5 left,5 down. The distance is quite far. Maybe there's a closer text block to interact with.

Alternatively, look at the key. The key is at 3 right,1 up. If I can get to the key, which is the win condition, then touching it would win. But the path is blocked by walls. The wall at 1 step up is stop, so I can't pass. 

Another idea: Maybe create a new rule that makes Baba able to pass through walls. For example, ""BABA IS NOT STOP"". To do that, I need to move the 'not' text block, but I don't see 'not' in the current objects. Alternatively, use existing rules. 

Alternatively, ""BABA IS WIN"" would make me win immediately when I step on anything, including the key. To create this rule, I need the 'baba', 'is', and 'win' text blocks. The 'win' is already attached to the key. If I can detach 'win' from the key and attach it to 'baba', that would work. 

The 'win' rule is at 5 right,1 up, next to 'is' and 'key'. So the current rule is ""key is win"". To make ""baba is win"", I need to rearrange these text blocks. If I can move 'is' and 'win' to the 'baba' rule, which is at 5 left,5 down. But that's a far distance. 

Perhaps there's a way to move the 'is' and 'win' closer. The 'is' is at 4 right,1 up. The 'win' is at 5 right,1 up. If I can move these to the left towards the 'baba' rule. But how? 

Since I'm Baba (you), I can move any text blocks that are not 'stop'. The 'stop' rule is active, but text blocks themselves aren't stopped unless they're part of a 'stop' rule. So I can move the 'is', 'win', 'key', 'door', etc., as long as they're not part of a 'stop' rule. 

So, the plan is: Move the 'is' and 'win' text blocks to the 'baba' rule to form ""baba is win"". To do that, I need to navigate to their positions and move them. 

The 'is' is at 4 right,1 up. From the player's position (5 left,5 down), moving right and up. But there are walls in the way. For example, moving right from the player's position: the wall at 1 step up is stop, so can't go through. But if I can move the 'stop' rule, then the wall becomes passable. 

So maybe first, move the 'stop' rule away. The 'stop' is at 3 left,1 up. To reach it, the player needs to move left twice and up four times. But that's a long way. Alternatively, find a shorter path. 

Alternatively, push a wall to create a path. But walls are stop, so can't be pushed. 

Another angle: The key is win, and it's at 3 right,1 up. If I can reach the key, even if there's a wall, maybe by changing the rule so that the wall isn't stop. 

So let's try to move the 'stop' rule. The 'stop' rule is at 3 left,1 up. The player is at 5 left,5 down. The distance is 2 steps left and 4 steps up. That's quite a distance. Maybe there's a way to move closer by moving other objects. 

Looking at the objects, there's a 'door' rule at 3 right,1 down. Maybe moving that, but not sure. 

Alternatively, the 'key' is at 3 right,1 up. If I can move the 'key' text block to be next to the 'baba' rule, but that's also far. 

Wait, perhaps the solution is to move the 'win' rule from the key to Baba. Since the key is win, but if I can make Baba win, then standing anywhere would win. 

To do that, I need to create the rule ""baba is win"". The 'baba' rule is at 5 left,5 down. The 'is' is at 4 right,1 up. The 'win' is at 5 right,1 up. So the current arrangement is key-is-win. To form baba-is-win, I need to move 'is' and 'win' left past the key. 

But moving those would require navigating around the walls. The wall at 1 step up is stop, blocking the path. So unless we remove the 'stop' rule, we can't get past. 

So the steps might be:

1. Move the 'stop' rule away from the 'wall' rule so that the wall at 1 up is no longer stop.
2. Navigate past the now-passable wall to the key.
3. Alternatively, rearrange the text blocks to make 'baba is win' regardless of path.

But how to move the 'stop' rule? The 'stop' is a text block that can be moved since it's not part of a 'stop' property (the 'stop' property is on the wall). So, I can move the 'stop' text block. 

To move the 'stop' rule at 3 left,1 up, I need to be adjacent to it. The player is at 5 left,5 down. The 'stop' is 2 steps left and 4 steps up. To get there, the player would have to move left twice and up four times, but the path is blocked by walls. 

Alternatively, is there a way to move the 'stop' rule indirectly? For example, by pushing other objects into it? But I don't see any movable objects except the text blocks. 

Another thought: The 'key' is win, so if I can reach the key, I win. The key is at 3 right,1 up. The wall at 1 up is stop, but if I can make that wall not stop, then I can pass. To do that, I need to move the 'stop' rule away from the 'wall' rule. 

The 'wall' rule is at 5 left. The 'stop' rule is at 3 left,1 up. The current rule is ""wall is stop"" formed by these two. If I can move either the 'wall' or 'stop' rule, the connection breaks. 

But the 'wall' rule is part of the map, so maybe it's fixed. The 'stop' rule is movable. So moving the 'stop' rule away from the 'wall' would break the ""wall is stop"" rule. 

So, moving the 'stop' rule to a different position. For example, moving it to the position of the 'door' rule at 3 right,1 down. But how to get there? 

The player is at 5 left,5 down. To reach the 'stop' at 3 left,1 up, it's a long way. Maybe a better approach is to move the 'stop' rule closer to the player. 

Wait, perhaps the player can move the 'stop' rule by moving adjacent to it and then pushing it. But the player is at 5 left,5 down. The 'stop' is at 3 left,1 up. The distance is quite large. Maybe there's a shorter path via other text blocks. 

Alternatively, focus on creating the ""baba is win"" rule. The 'baba' rule is at 5 left,5 down. The 'is' is at 4 right,1 up. The 'win' is at 5 right,1 up. So to form ""baba is win"", the player needs to move the 'is' and 'win' text blocks to the left next to 'baba'. 

But moving those blocks would require traversing through the map. The 'is' is at 4 right,1 up. To get there from the player's position (5 left,5 down), the player needs to move right 9 steps and up 4 steps, which is impossible due to walls. 

Alternatively, maybe the solution is to push the 'is' and 'win' text blocks towards the 'baba' rule by using other movable objects. But I don't see any other movable objects except the text blocks themselves, which can be moved if they're not 'stop'. 

Wait, the 'key' is a movable object because it's not 'stop' (since 'key is win', not 'key is stop'). So maybe the player can move the 'key' to create space. 

The key is at 3 right,1 up. If the player can move the key to the left, perhaps that creates a path. Moving the key left would require being adjacent to it. The key is at 3 right,1 up. The player is at 5 left,5 down. So the distance is significant. 

Another angle: Since the key is win, maybe touching it is enough. But the path is blocked. Unless we can remove the 'stop' property from the wall. 

So, back to moving the 'stop' rule. The 'stop' rule is at 3 left,1 up. The player needs to move left twice and up four times to reach it. But the way is blocked by walls. For example, moving up from the player's position (5 left,5 down) to 5 left,4 down (a wall), then can't proceed. 

Alternatively, find a path around the walls. For instance, move right to reach a passable area. But the player is at 5 left,5 down. Moving right would take them to 4 left,5 down, which might be a wall or not. Checking the objects: There's a wall at 3 steps to the right and 3 steps down, but that's not in this area. 

This is getting complicated. Maybe the intended solution is to move the 'stop' rule to a different position, allowing passage. Let's try to think step by step:

1. Current position: Player (Baba) is at rule `baba` location: 5 left,5 down.
2. Target: Move the 'stop' rule away from the 'wall' to make the wall passable.
3. 'stop' rule is at 3 left,1 up. Need to move it.
4. To move the 'stop' rule, the player must be adjacent to it and move it in a direction.
5. The player is 2 steps left and 4 steps up from the 'stop' rule. How to reach there?

Alternatively, maybe the player can push other objects to create a path. For example, push the 'wall' that's at 1 step up, but walls are stop, so can't be pushed.

Wait, the 'wall' at 1 step up is affected by the 'stop' rule. If we remove the 'stop' rule, that wall becomes passable. So the priority is to move the 'stop' rule.

But how to move it? The player is too far away. Maybe there's a way to indirectly influence the 'stop' rule's position.

Another idea: Use the 'door' rule. The 'door' is at 3 steps right,1 step down. Not sure how that helps.

Alternatively, look for other text blocks that can be moved to block or unblock something. 

Wait, the 'key' is win. If I can move the 'key' to the player's position, but the key is at 3 right,1 up. Moving it would require being adjacent. 

Alternatively, the solution is to create the ""baba is win"" rule by moving the existing 'is' and 'win' text blocks next to 'baba'. Since the 'is' and 'win' are attached to the key, maybe detaching them and moving them.

The current rule is ""key is win"", formed by 'key', 'is', 'win'. To create ""baba is win"", I need to rearrange these. So, move the 'is' and 'win' from the key to the 'baba' rule.

The 'baba' rule is at 5 left,5 down. The 'is' is at 4 right,1 up. The 'win' is at 5 right,1 up. So moving 'is' left and 'win' left past the key.

But the path is blocked by the wall at 1 up (stop). Unless we remove the 'stop' rule.

This seems like a dead end. Maybe the correct action is to move the 'stop' rule to the left or right, away from the 'wall' rule.

The 'stop' rule is at 3 left,1 up. If I move it","

Let's try to figure out how to solve this Baba Is You level. The active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". So right now, the key is acting as the win condition. My goal is to get the key, which is the win object. I need to move towards it.

Looking at the objects on the map, the key is located at 3 steps to the right and 1 step up from my current position. Wait, no, in the latest observation, the key is at 3 steps to the right and 1 step up. But wait, the player (Baba) is probably at the starting position, which seems to be near the bottom left based on the rules and walls arranged.

Looking at the map structure:

- There's a wall at 1 step up, which is a STOP object. So I can't go through that.
- The key is at 3 steps right and 1 step up. But there's a rule `door` at 3 steps right and 1 step down. Hmm, maybe the door is blocking the path upwards?
- There's a ball at 1 step to the right, which might be a distraction. The ball is probably not interactable unless there's a rule that changes it, but right now the rules are key is win and baba is you. So moving the ball might not help unless I can turn it into something else.

The main obstacles here are the walls labeled as STOP. Since ""wall is stop"", any wall is immovable. So I need to find a way around them. Maybe by redefining the rules. For example, if I can make the door not a stop, or turn the wall into something else.

But the current active rules are key is win and baba is you. To move the key, I might need to pick up the ""is"" and ""win"" text blocks to create a new rule. For instance, if I can make ""baba is win"", then touching the key would make me win. Alternatively, maybe make ""key is you"" so I can move the key myself.

Wait, but how do I interact with the text blocks? I think I can pick up text blocks that are not STOP. The rules say I can only move objects or text not defined as STOP. So the rule `stop` is at 3 steps left and 1 step up. So the wall at 1 step up is STOP, meaning I can't move through it. But I can move the text blocks around if they aren't STOP.

Looking at the objects, there's a rule `key` at 3 steps right and 1 step up. To pick that up, I need to move right and up. But the wall at 1 step up is STOP, so I can't go through it. Maybe I need to move the wall out of the way by redefining it. For example, if I can change ""wall is stop"" to something else, then the wall becomes movable.

But to do that, I need to modify the existing rules. The current rules are ""key is win"", ""wall is stop"", and ""baba is you"". The text blocks for these rules are located at various positions. For instance, the ""wall is stop"" rule is made of the text blocks 'wall' at 5 steps left, 'is' at 4 steps left, and 'stop' at 3 steps left. If I can move these text blocks, I can change the rule.

So the plan might be:

1. Move to the position of the 'stop' text block (3 steps left and 1 step up) to pick it up.
2. Then rearrange the text blocks to change ""wall is stop"" to something else, like ""wall is you"" or ""stop is..."" which would make the wall movable.

Alternatively, create a new rule that allows me to pass through the wall. For example, ""baba can move through stop"" by rearranging the rules. But I need to have the necessary text blocks.

Looking at the available text blocks, besides the existing rules, there's a 'door' rule at 3 steps right and 1 step down. Maybe that can be used. Also, the 'baba', 'is', 'you' text blocks are at the bottom left (5 steps left and 5 steps down).

Wait, in the last observation, the rule `baba` is at 5 steps left and 5 steps down, along with 'is' and 'you'. So if I can get to those, I can create a new rule like ""baba is win"" which would make me win immediately by standing on the key.

But how to get there? The path might be blocked by walls. Let's see:

From my current position (assuming starting at 0,0), the key is at (3,1). There's a wall at (0,1) which is STOP. So I need to go around it. Maybe go down to (0,0), then right to (3,0), but there's a wall at (3,0) as well. Wait, looking at the objects:

- Wall at 1 step up (so (0,1))
- Wall at 3 steps right and 3 steps down (but that's probably further down)
- The key is at (3,1)
- The door is at (3, -1) (1 step down)
- There's a key at (4, -2) (2 steps down)

So the path to the key is blocked by the wall at (0,1). To get around it, maybe move down to (0,0), then right to (3,0), but there's a wall at (3,0). Alternatively, find another path.

Wait, the ball is at (1,0). Maybe I can push it, but since I'm Baba and the rules are key is win and baba is you, pushing might not be possible unless there's a rule allowing it. But by default, can I push objects? The rules don't specify, so probably not. So I have to move around.

Alternatively, redefine the 'stop' property. If I can change ""wall is stop"" to ""wall is you"", then walls become movable. Let's see where the 'stop' text block is. In the last observation, the rule `stop` is at 3 step to the left and 1 step up. So position (-3,1). The 'wall' part of ""wall is stop"" is at 5 step left, 'is' at 4 step left, 'stop' at 3 step left.

So to change ""wall is stop"" to ""wall is you"", I need to replace 'stop' with 'you'. But 'you' is at 2 step left and 5 steps down. That's quite far. Alternatively, create a new rule ""baba is win"" using the 'baba', 'is', 'win' text blocks.

The 'baba' rule is at 5 step left and 5 steps down, 'is' at 4 step left and 5 steps down, 'win' at 3 step left and 5 steps down. So if I can move those three text blocks together to form ""baba is win"", then touching any win object (which is the key) would make me win.

But how to move them? The 'baba', 'is', 'win' are all at the bottom left. To get there, I need to navigate around the walls. Let's see:

From current position (assuming starting at 0,0), the path to the bottom left might be blocked. There's a wall at (0,1), but maybe I can go down to (0,0), then left? But can I move left? The initial observations don't mention left movement being blocked, but walls are present. Looking at the objects:

- At 2 steps left and 1 step up: rule `stop`
- At 3 steps left and 1 step up: wall (part of the STOP rule)
- At 5 steps left: rule `wall`
- Etc., down to 5 steps left and 5 steps down: rule `baba`

So to get to the 'baba', 'is', 'win' text blocks at the bottom left, I need to move left and down. But moving left from (0,0) would be to (-1,0), but is there a wall there? The objects listed don't show a wall at (-1,0), so maybe it's possible. But I have to check if there are any STOP objects in the path.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the 'stop' rule to a different position, allowing me to pass through the wall at (0,1). For example, if I can make the wall not a STOP, then I can go around it.

To do that, I need to break the ""wall is stop"" rule. The rule is composed of 'wall' at 5 steps left, 'is' at 4 steps left, 'stop' at 3 steps left. If I can move these text blocks, I can change the rule.

Let's say I move the 'stop' text block from (3 left,1 up) to somewhere else. Then the ""wall is stop"" rule would be broken, and walls would no longer be STOP. That would make them movable.

But to pick up the 'stop' text block, I need to move to its position. It's at 3 steps left and 1 step up. From my current position (assuming starting at 0,0), that's left 3, up 1. But there's a wall at (0,1) which is STOP. So I can't go through it. Unless I can move around it somehow.

Alternatively, if I can make the wall at (0,1) not a STOP, then I can walk through it. But that requires changing the ""wall is stop"" rule, which is what I'm trying to do.

This seems a bit circular. Maybe another approach: create a new rule that allows me to move over STOP objects. For example, ""baba can move over stop"" by creating a rule like ""baba is push"" or something. But I need the text blocks for that.

Alternatively, make the door not a stop. The door is at 3 steps right and 1 step down. If I can change the 'stop' property to something else, maybe the door becomes passable.

But I'm not sure. Let's think step by step.

Current active rules:

1. key is win: Touching the key makes me win.
2. baba is you: I am controllable.

Objects nearby:

- Key at (3,1), but blocked by wall at (0,1) which is STOP.
- Door at (3,-1), which might be a way to exit or enter another area.
- Ball at (1,0), maybe a distraction.
- Text blocks for rules at various positions, especially the 'baba', 'is', 'you' at the bottom left.

Possible actions:

1. Move towards the key, but blocked by wall.
2. Move to the text blocks at the bottom left to create a new rule like ""baba is win"".
3. Rearrange existing rules to make walls passable.

Option 2 seems promising. If I can create ""baba is win"", then standing on the key (which is win) would make me win. So I need to gather the 'baba', 'is', 'win' text blocks.

The 'baba' rule is at 5 left,5 down; 'is' at 4 left,5 down; 'win' at 3 left,5 down. To form ""baba is win"", I need to place them in that order.

But how to get there? From my current position (assuming starting at 0,0), moving left 5 and down 5 would be quite a distance. There are walls along the way. For example, at 2 left,1 up is a 'stop' rule, and at 0,1 is a wall. But if I can move left past those, maybe.

Alternatively, use the existing key and door to find a way. The door is at (3,-1). If I can move through the door, maybe it connects to another part of the level. But without knowing the level layout, it's hard to say.

Another angle: Since the key is the win object, maybe I don't need to touch it directly if I can redefine the win condition. For example, make ""baba is win"", so just being Baba makes me win. But that requires creating that rule.

To do that, I need to move the 'baba', 'is', 'win' text blocks. Let's see their positions:

- 'baba' rule: 5 left,5 down
- 'is' rule: 4 left,5 down
- 'win' rule: 3 left,5 down

So they are adjacent horizontally. If I can move them to form ""baba is win"" by placing them next to each other in that order, then the rule becomes active.

But how to move them? Each text block is part of a rule, so I might need to break existing rules first. For example, the ""key is win"" rule is at 3 right,1 up. If I can break that rule by moving its components, I can free up the 'win' text block to use in the new rule.

The ""key is win"" rule consists of:

- 'key' at 6 right,1 up
- 'is' at7 right,1 up
- 'win' at8 right,1 up

If I can move these text blocks, I can remove the ""key is win"" rule and reuse the 'win' block.

So step by step:

1. Move to the 'win' text block at 8 right,1 up, pick it up, and move it to the 'baba' area.
2. Break the ""key is win"" rule by moving its 'key', 'is', 'win' blocks apart.
3. Create the new rule ""baba is win"" by placing 'baba', 'is', 'win' together.

This would make ""baba is win"" active, so just by being Baba (which I am), I win. Then I don't need to touch the key.

But this requires navigating through the map, moving multiple text blocks, and avoiding STOP walls.

Alternatively, if I can make the door a win condition. The door is at 3 right,1 down. If I can create a rule like ""door is win"", then touching the door would make me win. But how to get there?

The door is at (3,-1). To get there, I need to move right and down. From (0,0), right 3 and down 1 would be (3,-1), which is the door's position. But on the way, there's a wall at (3,0) (from the observation: wall 3 steps to the right). So I can't go right past that.

Wait, in the latest observation, there's a wall at 3 steps right (so (3,0)), which is a STOP. So I can't move right past that. Unless I can change the wall's property.

This is getting complicated. Maybe the fastest way is to focus on creating the ""baba is win"" rule.

To do that, I need to gather the 'baba', 'is', 'win' text blocks. The 'win' block is currently part of the ""key is win"" rule. So I need to break that rule first.

Breaking ""key is win"" requires moving the 'key', 'is', 'win' text blocks away from each other. For example, move the 'win' block to the 'baba' area.

Assuming I can move the 'win' block from (8 right,1 up) to (3 left,5 down), which is where the 'baba' and 'is' blocks are.

But how to move the 'win' block? I need to navigate to its position, which is 8 steps right and 1 step up. From my current position (assuming starting at 0,0), that's a long way to the right. There are walls along the way, like at 3 steps right (STOP wall), which blocks the path.

Wait, in the current observation, there's a wall at 3 steps right (position (3,0)), which is STOP. So moving right past that is impossible unless the wall is no longer STOP.

This seems like a dead end. Maybe another approach: use the existing 'you' rule to become something else.

Since ""baba is you"", I am Baba. If I can create a rule like ""baba is win"", then I win. But to do that, I need the 'win' text block.

Alternatively, make ""you is win"", which would make any object labeled 'you' win. Since I am 'you' (because ""baba is you""), then I would win by being 'you' if 'you' is win. But that requires creating ""you is win"".

The 'you' text block is at 3 step to the left and 5 steps down. So if I can move 'you' to be next to 'win', that could work.

But again, the problem is accessing those text blocks due to walls.

Perhaps the key is to first move the 'stop' rule to allow passing through walls. For example, changing ""wall is stop"" to ""wall is push"" or something. But I don't have the 'push' text block.

Alternatively, create a rule that negates 'stop'. For example, ""stop is nothing"", but I don't have the 'nothing' block.

This is really tricky. Maybe the intended solution is to move the 'key' to be under the 'win' rule, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, another thought: since the key is the win object, maybe I just need to stand on it. But it's blocked by a STOP wall. If I can make the wall not a STOP, then I can walk over it.

To do that, I need to break the ""wall is stop"" rule. The rule is made of 'wall' at 5 left, 'is' at4 left, 'stop' at3 left. If I can move these blocks apart.

For example, move the 'stop' block to another position, which would break the rule. Then walls are no longer STOP, so I can move through them.

But to move the 'stop' block, I need to go to its position at 3 left,1 up. From my current position (assuming starting at 0,0), that's left 3, up 1. But there's a wall at (0,1) which is STOP. I can't go through it. So how to get there?

Unless I can move the wall at (0,1) out of the way. But the wall is part of the ""wall is stop"" rule. If I break that rule, the wall becomes movable.

This is a loop. Maybe I need to push the wall instead. But can I push it? The rules don't mention pushing, so probably not unless there's a rule allowing it.

Alternatively, if I can make the wall a PUSH object. For example,","

Let's try to figure out what to do here. The active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". So, normally, getting the key would make it a win condition, but right now the key is labeled as win. Maybe that's part of the puzzle.

Looking at the objects, the ball is at 1 step to the right. Wait, no, the ball is actually at ""ball 1 step to the right"" from the player's position. But the key is at 3 steps to the right and 1 step up. The door is at 3 steps to the right and 1 step down. Hmm.

The player is probably where the ""baba"" rule is, which is at 5 steps to the left and 5 steps down. But maybe I'm misunderstanding the positions. Let me parse the objects again.

The key is at 3 steps right, 1 step up. The rule `win` is next to it. Since ""key is win"", moving the key to where the win condition is might not help. Wait, maybe the goal is to reach the door, but the door is behind a wall? Or maybe the door is a stop because of the ""wall is stop"" rule. But ""wall is stop"" is still active, so any wall is immovable.

Wait, the player is ""baba"", so if I can change the rules to make myself a different thing, maybe I can bypass the walls. For example, if I can make baba be ""win"", then touching the win object would win. Or maybe make baba ""not stop"". Let's see the available text blocks.

Looking at the map, there are rule blocks scattered around. The closest ones are the ""stop"" rule at 3 steps left and 1 step up, wall rules, etc. If I can move the ""is"" and ""win"" blocks together to create a new rule, like ""baba is win"", then touching the win (which is the key) would make me win. But how do I move those blocks?

The key is at 3R,1U. The ""win"" rule is at 5R,1U. So between them are ""key"" and ""is"". To create ""baba is win"", I need to get the ""baba"" rule, which is at 5L,5D, and bring it near the ""win"" rule. But that's far away. Alternatively, maybe use existing blocks.

Wait, the player is at the position of the ""baba"" rule, which is 5 steps left and 5 steps down. So the player's current position is there. To move, perhaps the direction keys. Let me check the objects around the player.

From the observation, the player is at the position of the ""baba"" rule. The ""stop"" rule is 3 steps left and 1 step up. The wall is 1 step up. So moving up from the player's position would hit a wall (since ""wall is stop""), which can't be moved. Moving left would take me closer to the ""stop"" rule, but that's also a wall. Maybe down? Let's see.

If I move down from the player's position (5L,5D), what's there? The map shows walls at various positions, but maybe there's a path. Alternatively, maybe I need to move some text blocks to create a new rule.

The key is at 3R,1U. The ""win"" rule is at 5R,1U. So if I can move the ""is"" block (which is at 4R,1U) between the key and the win, then create ""key is win"", but that's already the case. The active rule is ""key is win"", so maybe the goal is to get the key, but since key is win, maybe touching the key makes you win. But the key is at 3R,1U, which is behind a wall (wall is at 1 step up). So how to reach it?

Alternatively, maybe the key is the win object, so if I can pick up the key, but you can't pick up objects unless you're ""you"". Since ""baba is you"", maybe that's possible. Wait, ""baba is you"" means the player can move objects that aren't stop. But the key is a win object, not stop, so maybe the player can move it.

Wait, the key is at 3R,1U. To get there, the player needs to move right and up. But the wall at 1 step up is a stop, so can't be moved. So moving up from the player's position (5L,5D) would hit the wall at 1 step up. So that's blocked.

Alternatively, maybe there's a different approach. The door is at 3R,1D. If I can make the door not a stop, then I could go through it. But the door's rule is ""door"" at 6R,1D? Wait, in the current observation, the rule `door` is at 3 steps to the right and 1 step down. Wait, the objects are:

- rule `door` 3 steps to the right and 1 step down
- wall 2 steps down
- key 4 steps to the right and 2 steps down
- etc.

So the door is at 3R,1D. If I can make the door not a stop, maybe by changing the ""wall is stop"" rule. But the ""wall is stop"" rule is at 5L (2 step to the left and 1 step up). To move that rule, I need to be able to move objects that aren't stop. Since I'm baba and you, I can move things that aren't stop. The ""wall is stop"" rule is a text block, but is it considered a stop? The rule is ""wall is stop"", so walls are stop. But the text blocks themselves—are they considered stop? Probably not, unless specified. Since the active rule is ""wall is stop"", but text blocks aren't walls, so they can be moved.

So, if I can move the ""wall is stop"" rule away, then walls wouldn't be stop anymore. That would let me move through walls. But how to do that? The ""wall is stop"" rule is at 5L (2 step left and 1 step up). To move it, I need to be next to it and move left or right. The player is at 5L,5D. To reach the ""wall is stop"" rule at 2L,1U, the player would need to move up and left multiple times. But the path is blocked by walls.

Alternatively, maybe there's a different text block to manipulate. The ""stop"" rule is at 3L,1U. If I can move that rule, perhaps to change what is stop. For example, if I make ""door is stop"" instead, then the door would be a wall. But that might not help.

Wait, the key is win, so if I can reach the key, that should win the level. But the key is at 3R,1U, behind a wall. Maybe I can push the wall? But walls are stop, so I can't move them. Unless I change the rule that makes walls stop.

So the plan is: move the ""wall is stop"" rule to somewhere else, thereby removing the stop property from walls. Then, walls can be moved, allowing me to push them out of the way to reach the key.

To do that, I need to grab the ""wall is stop"" rule text block. The text block is at 2L,1U (since rule `wall` is at 3 step to the left, and rule `is` is at 2 step to the left, etc.). Wait, in the current observation:

Objects on the map include:
- rule `stop` 3 step to the left and 1 step up
- rule `wall` 5 step to the left
- rule `is` 4 step to the left

Wait, the ""wall is stop"" rule is composed of three text blocks: ""wall"", ""is"", ""stop"". The ""stop"" rule is at 3L,1U. The ""wall"" rule is at 5L, and ""is"" is at 4L. So to form ""wall is stop"", the ""wall"" (5L) and ""is"" (4L) are next to each other, then ""stop"" (3L,1U) is attached? Or maybe arranged in a line.

Assuming the text blocks are placed horizontally, ""wall"" at 5L, ""is"" at 4L, and ""stop"" at 3L,1U. To move this rule, I need to pick up the ""stop"" block. Since the player is at 5L,5D, which is the position of the ""baba"" rule. To reach the ""stop"" block at 3L,1U, the player needs to move left and up. But the path is blocked by walls. For example, moving left from 5L to 4L, but there's a wall at 1 step up (wall 1 step up). Wait, the wall at 1 step up is at the player's current position's 1U, which is 5L,1U. But the player is at 5L,5D. So moving up from there would go through the wall at 5L,1U, which is a stop. Can't move through that.

This seems really stuck. Maybe there's another approach. Since the key is win, maybe touching the key is enough. But how to reach it. Alternatively, maybe the door can be used. The door is at 3R,1D. If I can make the door not a stop, then I can go through it. But the door's rule is at 3R,1D. Wait, the rule `door` is at 3R,1D. To change the door's properties, I need to create a new rule like ""door is not stop"". But to do that, I need to move the ""is"" and ""not stop"" blocks. But ""not stop"" isn't a current rule here.

Alternatively, maybe make ""baba is door"", then go through the door. But that requires creating ""baba is door"" rule. The ""baba"" rule is at 5L,5D. The ""door"" rule is at 3R,1D. So the player would need to move the ""baba"", ""is"", and ""door"" blocks together. That's a long way, but possible?

The player is at 5L,5D. To get to the ""door"" rule at 3R,1D, the player would need to move right and up multiple times, but there are walls blocking the path. For example, moving right to 4L,5D: is there a wall there? Looking at the objects, there's a wall at 3R, which is the opposite direction. Maybe the path is blocked by walls at certain steps.

This is getting complicated. Maybe another angle: since ""key is win"", perhaps the win condition is the key itself. So if I can grab the key, that would win. To grab the key, I need to be next to it and move into it. But the key is at 3R,1U, behind a wall. The wall is at 1 step up from the player's position. So moving up from the player's position (5L,5D) to 5L,4D, then 5L,3D, etc., until reaching 5L,1U, which is a wall. So stuck again.

Wait, maybe the key is at 3 steps right and 1 step up from the player's current position. The player is at 5L,5D. So moving right three times would get to 2L,5D. Then up once to 2L,4D. But where are the walls in between? The wall at 1 step up is at 5L,1U, which is not on this path. So maybe the path is clear. Let me visualize:

Player starts at 5L,5D (baba's position).

Move right once: 4L,5D. Is there a wall here? Looking at the objects, the walls are at 3R (which is 2L from the player's starting position?), 1 step up, 1 step down, etc. Hmm, maybe the walls are arranged in a specific pattern. This is getting confusing without a visual map.

Alternatively, maybe the solution is to move the ""win"" rule to be under the key. But ""key is win"" is already active. So touching the key would trigger the win. But how to reach the key.

Another thought: since ""baba is you"", maybe pushing objects. If I can push the wall next to the key, moving it away. The wall at 1 step up is blocking the path to the key. To push it, I need to be on the opposite side. But the wall is at 1 step up from the player's position. The key is at 3R,1U. So if I can move the wall out of the way, maybe by pushing it down. But walls are stop, so can't be moved unless the rule is changed.

This is really tricky. Maybe the answer is to keep moving right towards the key, even if it's blocked, but the previous actions didn't work. The assistant kept getting errors, so maybe the correct action is to move right repeatedly until reaching the key, or to find a way to alter the rules.

Wait, looking back at the previous actions, the assistant kept moving left and right, which might not be effective. Maybe the correct action now is to move up, but the player's position is 5L,5D. Moving up would go towards the wall at 1 step up. That's not possible. Moving left would go further away from the key. Moving right might get closer.

Alternatively, the assistant needs to find the text blocks to create a new rule. For example, to make ""baba is win"", so that touching anything win makes the player win. The ""baba"" rule is at 5L,5D. The ""win"" rule is at 5R,1U. To connect them, the player needs to move those blocks together. But that's a long distance.

Given the previous failures, maybe the correct action now is to move right towards the key, even if it's blocked, but perhaps there's a way around. Or maybe the solution is to move the ""stop"" rule away. For example, moving the ""stop"" rule at 3L,1U to another position, thereby removing the stop property from walls.

To do that, the player would need to grab the ""stop"" text block. The ""stop"" rule is at 3L,1U. The player is at 5L,5D. The distance is 2 steps left and 4 steps up. That's a long way, but possible by moving left and up repeatedly. However, there are walls blocking the path. For instance, moving left from 5L to 4L, then 3L, but at each step, are there walls?

Looking at the objects, there's a wall at 1 step up (5L,1U). So moving up from 5L,5D to 5L,4D, then 5L,3D, etc., until reaching 5L,1U (a wall), then can't proceed. So that path is blocked.

Alternatively, moving right towards the key. The key is at 3R,1U. From the player's position (5L,5D), moving right three times would get to 2L,5D. Then up once to 2L,4D. Then right again to 1L,4D, etc. But are there walls in between?

It's unclear without the exact map layout, but based on the previous observations, the assistant is struggling to find a valid action. Maybe the correct action now is to move right, as that's the direction towards the key, even if it's blocked, hoping that the path clears or a rule change allows movement.

74,Failed to obtain a valid action from the reasoning.,"<reasoning>
Let's see. The current active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". So my goal is to get the key because it's defined as win. But I'm Baba, so since ""baba is you"", I can move around unless something is stop.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key at 2 steps to the right and 1 step up. The door is at 2 steps to the right and 1 step down. But the key is up there. The rule ""stop"" is 4 steps to the left and 1 step up, which might be a wall or something immovable.

Wait, the wall positions: There's a wall at 1 step to the left and 1 step up. Then rule `stop` is further left. So maybe I need to navigate around the walls. Let me check my current position. The user hasn't specified where Baba is, but based on the objects, maybe I'm at the starting point. Let's assume I'm near the bottom left since the key is moving right and up.

To reach the key at 2 steps right and 1 step up, I need to move right twice and up once. But there's a wall at 1 step to the left and 1 step up. Wait, the wall is blocking the path upwards. So how to get past that?

The rule ""stop"" is a property, and walls are stop. So maybe I need to remove the stop property from the wall or create a new rule. But I can only move objects that aren't stop. So if I can move the ""stop"" text block, maybe I can change the wall's property.

Looking at the objects, there's a rule `stop` at 4 steps left and 1 step up. That's part of the existing rule ""wall is stop"". So if I can move that ""stop"" text block away, maybe I can make the wall not stop anymore. Then I could pass through it.

But how to move the ""stop"" rule? To do that, I need to move the text blocks that form the rule ""wall is stop"". The rule is made up of ""wall"", ""is"", and ""stop"". The ""stop"" part is at 4 steps left and 1 step up. If I can move that ""stop"" text block, perhaps I can break the ""wall is stop"" rule. But I have to check if those text blocks are movable. Since the rule ""wall is stop"" is active, but the text blocks themselves might not be stop unless defined. The current active rules don't mark text blocks as stop, so maybe they can be moved.

So the plan is: move the ""stop"" text block away to disable the ""wall is stop"" rule, then navigate past the wall to get to the key. Alternatively, create a new rule that allows moving through the wall.

Alternatively, since the key is win, maybe grabbing the key (which is win) is enough. But how to reach it. Let me see the path. From my current position (assuming I'm near the lower left), moving right towards the key. But there's a wall at 1 step left and 1 step up. If I can remove that wall's stop property, then I can go around.

Alternatively, maybe create a rule like ""wall is_you"" or something, but I need to have the text blocks for that. Let's check the available text blocks. There are ""rule `stop`"", ""rule `key`"", ""rule `is`"", ""rule `win`"", etc. If I can rearrange them to form a new rule.

For example, if I can make ""wall is you"", then walls would be movable. But I need the ""you"" text block. Looking at the objects, there's a ""rule `you`"" at 4 steps left and 5 steps down. That's quite far. Maybe I can move that ""you"" block up to the wall's position.

But to move the ""you"" block, I need to move the text blocks that form the existing ""you"" rule. The ""you"" rule is at 3 step to the left and 5 steps down (rule `you` 3 step to the left and 5 steps down). So the text blocks for ""you"" are there. If I can move those, perhaps I can create a new rule.

This seems complicated. Maybe the easier way is to first move the ""stop"" rule away. Let's look at the ""stop"" rule's position: 4 step to the left and 1 step up. If I can move that ""stop"" text block to another spot, then the ""wall is stop"" rule is broken.

To move the ""stop"" text block, I need to be adjacent to it and move it in a direction. The ""stop"" rule is a single text block. So if I can get next to it and move it, say, to the right or left. But where is Baba located? The observation doesn't explicitly state Baba's position, but based on the rules and objects, perhaps Baba is at the position defined by the ""baba is you"" rule. Looking at the objects, there's a rule `baba` at 5 step to the left and 5 steps down, but that's part of the ""baba is you"" rule. Wait, the ""baba is you"" rule is made of three text blocks: ""baba"", ""is"", ""you"". The positions are:

rule `baba` 2 step to the left and 3 steps down
rule `is` 1 step to the left and 3 steps down
rule `you` 3 steps down

Wait, in the last observation, the ""baba is you"" rule is spread out. So maybe Baba's avatar is at the position of the ""baba"" text block? Or perhaps Baba is where the player is standing, which isn't specified here. This is a bit confusing without knowing the player's starting position.

Alternatively, maybe the player (Baba) is at the position where the ""baba"" rule's subject is, but that's not clear. Assuming I need to reach the key at 2 steps right and 1 step up, perhaps I need to move right twice and up once. But there's a wall at 1 step left and 1 step up. If I can remove the stop property from that wall, then I can go around.

To remove the stop property, I need to break the ""wall is stop"" rule. The ""wall is stop"" rule is composed of ""wall"", ""is"", ""stop"" text blocks. The ""stop"" part is at 4 step left and 1 step up. If I can move that ""stop"" text block away, the rule is broken. So moving the ""stop"" text block to a different position would do that.

So the steps would be:

1. Move to the position of the ""stop"" text block (4 step left and 1 step up).
2. Move the ""stop"" text block to a different location, say, to the right or left, thus breaking the ""wall is stop"" rule.
3. Then navigate past the wall to reach the key.

But first, I need to locate where I am. Since the observation doesn't specify Baba's position, this is tricky. Let's assume that the player is near the ""baba"" rule's text blocks. For example, in the last observation, the ""baba is you"" rule is at positions 2 step left and 3 steps down for ""baba"", 1 step left and 3 steps down for ""is"", and 3 steps down for ""you"". So maybe Baba is at 2 step left and 3 steps down? Or perhaps the player's position is separate and needs to be inferred.

Alternatively, maybe the player starts at a default position, like the bottom left, and needs to move towards the key. Let's assume I'm at the bottom left, needing to move right and up.

Looking at the objects, the key is at 2 steps right and 1 step up. There's a wall at 1 step left and 1 step up. To move right towards the key, I need to pass through the wall at 1 step left and 1 step up. But since it's a stop, I can't. So I need to disable that.

The ""stop"" rule is at 4 step left and 1 step up. That's part of the ""wall is stop"" rule. To break that, move the ""stop"" text block. So I need to move that ""stop"" block. Let's see where that ""stop"" is located relative to me. If I'm assuming I'm at the bottom left, moving right to reach the ""stop"" block at 4 step left and 1 step up would require moving left, which might not be possible. Wait, the positions are described relative to the player? Or is it an absolute grid?

This is getting complicated. Maybe a better approach is to try to move the key itself, but the active rule is ""key is win"", so maybe grabbing the key would make it win. But how to pick up the key? In Baba Is You, you can move objects that are not stopped. So if the key is not stopped, I can move it. The key's position is 2 steps right and 1 step up. If I can move right twice and up once, but the wall is in the way.

Alternatively, if I can make the wall not stop, then I can move through it. To do that, break the ""wall is stop"" rule by moving the ""stop"" text block. So the plan is: move the ""stop"" text block away.

The ""stop"" text block is at 4 step to the left and 1 step up. To move it, I need to be adjacent to it. If I'm at a position adjacent to that ""stop"" block, I can move it. But where is that? If the player is at, say, position (0,0), then the ""stop"" block is at (-4, 1). To get there, the player would need to move left four times and up once. But that might not be feasible if there are walls in the way.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to create a new rule that allows moving through walls. For example, ""wall is you"", making walls movable. To do that, I need to rearrange the text blocks ""wall"", ""is"", ""you"". The ""you"" block is at 4 step to the left and 5 steps down. That's far away. Maybe not practical.

Another idea: Since the key is win, maybe just move to the key's position and take it, even if there's a wall. But if the wall is stop, I can't pass through. Unless I can push the wall, but in Baba Is You, you can't push objects; you can only move text blocks and objects that aren't stop.

Wait, the rules might allow pushing if there's a rule like ""push is you"", but there's no such rule here. So probably can't push.

So back to the original plan: move the ""stop"" text block to break the ""wall is stop"" rule. Let's see if I can reach the ""stop"" block. Assuming I'm at the starting point, maybe I need to move left four times and up once, but there's a wall at 1 step left and 1 step up. Wait, the wall at 1 step left and 1 step up is part of the ""wall is stop"" rule. If I can remove the stop property, then that wall becomes passable.

This is a bit of a loop. Maybe the solution is to first move the ""stop"" block away. To do that, I need to be adjacent to it. Let's check the position of the ""stop"" block: 4 step to the left and 1 step up. If I'm at 3 step to the left and 1 step up, I can move left to get there. But how do I get there in the first place?

Alternatively, maybe the player is near the ""baba"" rule's text blocks. For example, in the last observation, the ""baba is you"" rule is at positions 2 step left and 3 steps down for ""baba"", 1 step left and 3 steps down for ""is"", and 3 steps down for ""you"". If the player is near there, they could move up to reach the ""stop"" block.

But without knowing the player's exact position, it's hard to plan. Given the uncertainty, perhaps the best immediate action is to move right towards the key, hoping that the wall isn't blocking the path once the ""stop"" rule is broken. Alternatively, try to move the ""stop"" block by moving adjacent text blocks.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is made of three text blocks: ""wall"", ""is"", ""stop"". The ""stop"" part is the last one. If I can move the ""stop"" text block, that would break the rule. So the action would be to move the ""stop"" block. To do that, I need to be next to it and move it in a direction. For example, if the ""stop"" block is at 4 step left and 1 step up, moving it to the right (decrementing the left steps) would be possible if there's no wall there.

Assuming the player can move left and up, the action would be to move left towards the ""stop"" block. But how many steps? The ""stop"" is 4 steps left and 1 step up. If the player is at, say, 0 steps left (origin), moving left four times and up once would reach the ""stop"" block. But there's a wall at 1 step left and 1 step up, which is part of the ""wall is stop"" rule. If that wall is stop, the player can't move through it. So this approach is blocked.

This is really tricky. Maybe another angle: since the key is win, and I'm Baba who is you, perhaps I can just move to the key's position and since it's win, that's the goal. But I can't get past the wall. Unless I can move the wall by changing its rule.

Alternatively, create a new rule like ""wall is you"", making walls movable. To do that, I need to rearrange the text blocks ""wall"", ""is"", ""you"". The ""you"" block is at 4 step left and 5 steps down, which is quite far. Maybe not reachable in one move.

Alternatively, take the ""you"" block from its current position and move it near the ""wall"" and ""is"" blocks. But that would require multiple moves, and the game might expect a single action.

Given the time constraints, maybe the best immediate action is to try to move right towards the key, hoping that the wall isn't there anymore. Or try to move the ""stop"" block by moving adjacent text blocks.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at 4 step left and 1 step up. The text blocks for ""wall is stop"" are likely arranged horizontally or vertically. For example, ""wall"" at 4 step left, ""is"" next to it, and ""stop"" next. If they're vertical, then moving the ""stop"" block down or up.

Assuming the text blocks are in a horizontal line: ""wall"" at (x, y), ""is"" at (x+1, y), ""stop"" at (x+2, y). If the ""stop"" is at 4 step left and 1 step up, then the ""wall"" would be at 4 step left, and ""is"" at 5 step left, and ""stop"" at 6 step left, all at 1 step up. But in the observation, the ""stop"" is at 4 step left and 1 step up, while the ""wall"" rule is at 5 step left. Hmm, maybe the text blocks are arranged differently.

Alternatively, the ""wall is stop"" rule is made of three separate text blocks placed somewhere. The ""wall"" rule is at 5 step left, ""is"" at 4 step left, and ""stop"" at 4 step left and 1 step up. This is confusing without a visual, but perhaps the ""stop"" block is separate.

In any case, to move the ""stop"" block, I need to be adjacent to it. If I can move left four times and up once to reach it, but there's a wall blocking the path, that's not possible. So maybe the solution is to first remove the wall's stop property by moving the ""stop"" block, but I can't get there.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe the intended solution is to realize that since the key is win, you just need to touch it. Even if there's a wall, maybe you can move around it by changing the rules. For example, create a rule that allows moving through walls.

But how? If I can create ""wall is you"", then walls become passable. To do that, I need to move the ""you"" text block to form that rule. The ""you"" block is at 4 step left and 5 steps down, which is far away. So maybe that's not feasible.

Alternatively, take the ""key"" and since it's win, just move to it. But the path is blocked. Unless there's another way.

Wait, looking at the objects, there's a door at 2 steps to the right and 1 step down. The key is at 2 steps right and 1 step up. Maybe the door is unlocked, and if you have the key, you can open it. But the rule ""door"" is just a rule; there's no ""key is door"" or ""door is unlock"" rule. So maybe the door is just a static object.

Another thought: Since ""key is win"", maybe grabbing the key automatically makes you win, regardless of position. But in Baba Is You, usually, you have to reach the win object, which might be the key. So you need to get to the key's position.

Given all this, perhaps the correct action is to move right towards the key, assuming that the wall's stop property has been removed. But how?

Alternatively, the solution involves moving the ""stop"" text block. For example, if I can move the ""stop"" block to the right, making the wall not stop. So the action would be to move the ""stop"" block to the right by one step. To do that, I need to be adjacent to it and move it.

Assuming the ""stop"" block is at 4 step left and 1 step up, and I'm at 3 step left and 1 step up, I can move left to get there. But how do I get to 3 step left and 1 step up? There might be walls in the way.

This is really challenging without knowing the exact layout and Baba's position. Given the time I've spent, I'll have to make an educated guess. The most plausible action is to move right towards the key, as that's the goal, and hope that the wall's stop property has been altered. Alternatively, try to move the ""stop"" block by moving it to the right.

Given the available information, the best action is probably to move right to approach the","

75,right,"<reasoning>
Let's try to figure out what to do here. The active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". So, normally, the goal would be to get to the key because it's defined as win. But maybe that's a trick? Let me check the objects on the map.

Looking around, the player (Baba) is probably near the bottom-left? There's a rule `baba` at 6 steps to the left and 5 steps down, along with `is` and `you`, which means that rule is ""baba is you"". That reinforces that the player is Baba.

Now, the key is at 3 steps to the right and 2 steps down. But between me and the key, there's a wall at 1 step to the left and 1 step down, and another wall at 1 step to the left and 2 steps down. Those are probably stop rules, meaning they block movement. So how do I get past them?

The key is marked as win, so grabbing it should let me win. But the walls are in the way. Wait, maybe I can manipulate the rules to make the walls not stop? The current rules have ""wall is stop"", but that's not active here. Let me check the active rules again. Oh, right, the active rules are only ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". So the wall's stop property isn't active? That seems odd. Maybe I need to create a new rule that changes wall's property.

Looking at the objects, there are text blocks for ""wall"", ""is"", and ""stop"" scattered around. For example, there's a rule `wall` at 6 steps to the left and a rule `is` next to it. If I can move those to form a new rule like ""wall is not stop"", that would let me walk through walls. But how do I move them?

First, I need to locate the text blocks. The rule `wall` is at 6 steps to the left, and there's an `is` at 5 steps to the left. So if I can move the `wall` and `is` together with a `not` or something, but wait, does the game have a ""not"" block? The observations don't mention it. Alternatively, maybe I can use existing blocks to form a rule that negates stop. But without a ""not"" block, that's tricky.

Alternatively, since the key is win, maybe I can just reach it by moving around the walls. But the walls are at 1 step left and 1 down, 1 left and 2 down. If I can move right past them. Let me see the player's position. The `baba` rule is at 6 steps left and 5 down, so the player is probably at 6 left, 5 down? Wait, no, the player is Baba, which is defined by the rule `baba` is you. The exact position might be harder to tell, but maybe I need to check the map layout.

Assuming the player is near the bottom-left, moving right towards the key. But the walls are in the way. Maybe there's a way to push the walls? But the rules say wall is stop, so they can't be moved. Unless I change the rule. So the plan is: either find a way to remove the stop property from walls or find a different path.

Alternatively, maybe the key is the win object, so grabbing it would make me win, regardless of the walls. But how to get there? Let me see the positions again. The key is at 3 steps right and 2 steps down from somewhere. If the player is at 6 left, 5 down, moving right 3 steps and down 2 steps would reach the key. But there's a wall at 1 left, 1 down (which is 5 left, 6 down if the player is at 6 left,5 down?), and another wall at 1 left, 2 down (4 left,7 down). So moving right past those walls would hit them because they're stop.

So the only way is to change the wall's rule. To do that, I need to find the text blocks for wall, is, and maybe not. Looking at the objects:

- rule `wall` at 6 steps left
- rule `is` at 5 steps left
- rule `stop` at 4 steps left and 1 step up

So if I can move the `wall` and `is` blocks together with a `not` block, but there's no `not` here. Alternatively, use the existing `stop` rule. Maybe combine them as ""wall is not stop""? But how? The available text blocks are wall, is, stop, key, win, door, you.

Wait, there's a rule `stop` at 4 left, 1 up. If I can move that to form a new rule. For example, moving `wall` to the left, `is` next to it, and `stop` somewhere to make ""wall is not stop"". But I don't have a 'not' block. Maybe the game allows using negative implications? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the current rule ""key is win"" can be changed. If I can make ""key is not win"", but that's counterproductive. Or change ""baba is you"" to something else, but that would make me not control Baba.

Hmm. Another approach: since the key is win, maybe I just need to touch it. If I can bypass the walls by moving around them. Let's see the layout. If the player is at 6 left,5 down, moving right towards the key at 3 right,2 down would go through positions 5 left,5 down (wall), then 4 left,5 down (maybe empty), then 3 left,5 down (key's position?). Wait, the key is at 3 steps right and 2 steps down from where? Maybe the coordinates are relative. This is getting confusing without a visual map.

Alternatively, maybe the path is blocked, so the only solution is to alter the wall's rule. Let's try to find the necessary text blocks. There's a rule `wall` at 6 left, a rule `is` at 5 left, and a rule `stop` at 4 left,1 up. If I can move the `wall`, `is`, and `stop` to create ""wall is not stop"". But without a 'not' block, this is difficult. Alternatively, use ""wall is key"" or something else, but that might not help.

Wait, the key is win. If I can make the walls into keys, then they wouldn't be stop. But how? If I form the rule ""wall is key"", then walls would be keys, and since key is win, touching a wall would make me win. But that's a stretch. Let's see: if I move the `wall` text block next to `is` and `key`, creating ""wall is key"". Then walls would be keys, which are win. So walking into a wall would make me win. But that's dangerous, but maybe possible.

Alternatively, make ""stop is key"", so stop becomes key. But not sure.

This is tricky. Maybe the intended solution is to push the door open? There's a rule `door` at 2 steps right and 1 step down. If I can change the door's rule to be passable. But how?

Alternatively, use the ball object. The ball is at 3 steps right. Not sure if that's relevant.

Another thought: the rule `you` is at 4 step to the left and 5 steps down. Maybe combining that with other rules. But not sure.

Wait, the player is Baba, and the rule `baba` is you. So the player is at the position of the `baba` rule, which is 6 step left and 5 steps down. To move right, the player would go to 5 left,5 down. But there's a wall at 1 step to the left and 1 step down from the player's position? Wait, the wall is at 1 step to the left and 1 step down. If the player is at 6 left,5 down, then 1 step left is 5 left,5 down, and 1 step down is 6 left,6 down. So the wall at 1 step left and 1 step down would be at 5 left,6 down. That's below the player. So moving down would hit that wall. But moving right would go towards the key.

Alternatively, move up. The rule `stop` is at 4 step left and 1 step up. If the player moves up, they might avoid the walls below. Let me see: player is at 6 left,5 down. Moving up to 6 left,4 down. Is there a wall there? There's a wall at 1 step left and 1 step up from the player's original position? No, the wall at 1 step left and 1 step up is at 5 left,4 down. So moving up from the player's position (6 left,5 down) to 6 left,4 down is clear? There's a rule `stop` at 4 left,1 up (which is 4 left,4 down?), but that's not in the same column.

This is getting complicated. Maybe the best approach is to try moving right towards the key, hoping that the walls aren't in the way. If the walls are actually not stop because the rule ""wall is stop"" is not active, but in the current active rules, it's not listed. Wait, the active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". The original rule ""wall is stop"" must have been changed or removed. Looking at the objects, there's a rule `wall` at 6 step left, but no rule `is stop` nearby. So maybe the ""wall is stop"" rule has been destroyed. If that's the case, then walls are not stop anymore, so they can be passed through. That would mean the player can walk through walls. If that's true, then the path to the key is clear.

So if the wall's stop property is removed, then moving right through the walls is possible. So the solution would be to move right towards the key. Let's check the objects again. The key is at 3 steps right and 2 steps down from the player's position (assuming player is at 6 left,5 down). So moving right 3 steps would get to 3 left,5 down, then down 2 steps to the key at 3 left,3 down. But there are walls at 1 left,1 down (5 left,6 down) and 1 left,2 down (4 left,7 down), but if walls are not stop, then the player can move through them. So the action would be to keep moving right towards the key.

Therefore, the chosen action is right.

Let me try to figure out the solution here. The goal is usually to reach the WIN object, but in this case, the active rules say ""key is win"", which means the key itself is what we need to interact with. So, the objective is to get to the key, which is now acting as the WIN condition.

Looking at the current observation, Baba is the player (baba is you). The key is located at 1 step to the right and 1 step up from my current position. There are walls (stop) around, so I need to navigate around them. Let me check the map layout again.

The active rules are key is win and baba is you. The key is to the right and up, but there's a rule `stop` 5 steps to the left and 1 step up. Wait, maybe that's not directly blocking the path. Let me visualize the position.

I think the key is positioned such that I need to move right and up to reach it. But are there any walls in the way? Let's see the objects:

- The key is at 1 step right and 1 step up.
- There's a wall at 2 steps left and 1 step up, and another wall at 2 steps left and 1 step down. So, my current position must be somewhere in the middle. To get to the key, moving right once and up once should do it. But I need to ensure that the path isn't blocked by a STOP wall. The rule `wall` is defined as stop, so any wall object is immovable.

Looking at the objects around the key's position: the key is at 1 right, 1 up. The wall is at 2 left, 1 up. So moving right from my current position (which is probably at the origin relative to these coordinates) would take me towards the key. But wait, the rule `stop` is at 5 steps left and 1 step up. That's far away, not blocking the immediate path.

Wait, maybe my current position is somewhere in the grid. Let's try to map it out:

Assuming the player's position is the starting point, and the objects are relative to that. For example, if the key is at 1 step right and 1 step up, then moving right would get me closer. But there's a wall at 2 steps left and 1 step up. So if I move right, I'm moving towards the key, and the wall is to the left, which doesn't block that path.

But I need to confirm if there are any other STOP objects in the way. The active rules include wall is stop, so any wall object is a stop. The walls mentioned are at various positions, but the one closest to the key's path might be the one at 2 steps left and 1 step up, which is to the left of the key's location. So moving right should be possible without hitting a wall.

Therefore, the best action is to move right towards the key, which is the WIN condition now. Once I pick up the key, since key is win, that should complete the level.

Let's see. The active rules are key is win and baba is you. So, the goal is usually to reach the key since it's defined as win. But I need to get there without hitting any walls which are stop.

Looking at the objects on the map. The key is at 1 step up. The player (Baba) is probably nearby. Let me check the positions again. Wait, the rule 'key' is 1 step up. So the key is directly above the player. But there's a wall 3 steps to the left and 1 step up. So the path might be blocked. But how is the player positioned? The 'baba' rule is at 8 steps to the left and 5 steps down, which is probably the player's location.

Wait, the player is at the position of the 'baba' rule. So the player is at 8 steps left and 5 steps down. The key is at 1 step up. So the direction to the key is upwards. But in the current observation, the wall is at 3 steps left and 1 step up. So the path up from the player's position is blocked by a wall. Hmm.

But maybe there's another way. Let me check other objects. There's a ball at 2 steps left. Not sure if that's useful. The door is at 1 step down. The stop rule is at 6 steps left and 1 step up, which is the same as the wall there. So that wall is immovable because it's stop.

Wait, but the player can move objects that aren't stop. So if I can move the 'key' text block to a different location, maybe I can create a new rule. For example, making the ball win instead of the key. But how?

The key is currently the win rule. To change that, I need to move the 'win' text block. The 'win' is at 2 steps right and 1 step up. If I can move that to the ball's position, then the ball becomes win. Then I can go get the ball instead.

But how to move the 'win' rule. To move a text block, I need to be adjacent to it and it's not stop. The 'win' rule is at 2 steps right and 1 step up from where? Wait, the player's position is 8 steps left and 5 steps down. The 'win' rule is at 2 steps right and 1 step up relative to the player? Or is it in absolute terms?

Wait, maybe the positions are relative to the player. So if the player is at 8 left,5 down, then the 'win' is 2 steps right (so 6 left) and 1 step up (so 4 down). But the player is at 8 left,5 down. So moving right would decrease the left steps. So from the player's position, moving right once would be 7 left,5 down. Then right again to 6 left,5 down. Then up once to 6 left,4 down. There's the 'win' rule there.

But how to get there. The path from player's position (8 left,5 down) to the 'win' rule (6 left,4 down) would require moving left three times and up once. But between the player and the 'win' rule, there's a wall at 3 steps left and 1 step up. Wait, the wall is at 3 left,1 up relative to where? Maybe the wall is at 3 steps to the left of the player's position, which would be 8+3=11 left? Or maybe the positions are in a grid. This is getting confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the player needs to navigate around the walls. Let's map it out. The player is at (0,0) for simplicity. The 'stop' rule is at 6 left and 1 up, which would be (-6,1). The 'key' is at 1 up, which is (0,1). The wall is at (-3,1). So to get to the key at (0,1), the path is blocked by a wall at (-3,1). So the player needs to go around that wall. But can't move through stop objects.

So possible actions: move right to get past the wall. From (0,0), moving right to (1,0), then right to (2,0), then up to (2,1). But is there a wall there? The wall at (-3,1) is to the left. So moving right should be possible. Then from (2,0), move up to (2,1), which is next to the key. Then take the key. But the key is 'win', so picking it up would make the player win? Or is the key just an object that needs to be reached because 'key is win'?

Wait, the active rule is 'key is win', so the goal is to reach the key. So moving to the key's position (0,1) would solve it. But the path is blocked by a wall at (-3,1). So how to get around it. Maybe move the wall? But the wall is 'stop', so the player can't move it. Unless the wall's rule is changed.

The 'wall' rule is at 8 left and 5 down? Wait, in the current observation, the 'wall' rule is at 8 step to the left. So relative to the player's position (8 left,5 down), the 'wall' rule is at 8 left,5 down minus 8 steps left? That doesn't make sense. Maybe the positions are absolute. This is getting complicated. Maybe the best approach is to move right to get past the blocking wall.

So the player is at (0,0). The key is at (0,1), but blocked by a wall at (-3,1). To reach the key, the player can move right to (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), etc., then up. But need to check if there are walls in the way. The 'wall' at 3 steps left and 1 step up is at (-3,1), which is left of the key. So moving right past that wall would be possible. So the path would be right three times to (3,0), then up to (3,1), then right to (3,2), etc., towards the key.

But looking at the objects, after moving right three times from (0,0), the player is at (3,0). Then up to (3,1). Is there a wall there? The 'wall' rule is at 8 left and 5 down, which is probably far away. So maybe moving up from (3,0) to (3,1) is possible. Then continue moving right towards the key at (0,1). Wait, that doesn't make sense. If the key is at (0,1), moving right would take the player away. Oh wait, maybe the coordinates are relative. This is confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the player needs to move towards the key by going around the wall. Since the wall is at (-3,1), the player can go around it by moving right past it. So from (0,0), move right to (1,0), then right to (2,0), then right to (3,0), then up to (3,1), then left to (2,1), then left to (1,1), then left to (0,1), which is the key. But is there a wall in that path?

Looking at the objects, after moving right to (3,0), up to (3,1), then left. The 'door' is at 1 step down, which might be at (0,-1). Not sure. The key is at 1 step up, which is (0,1). So the path from (3,1) to (0,1) would require moving left three times. Are there any walls along that path? The wall at (-3,1) is far to the left, so moving left from (3,1) to (0,1) should be clear. So that path seems possible.

So the action sequence would be: right, right, right, up, left, left, left, up. But the game probably requires one action per step. So the first action should be right. But maybe the immediate next step is to move right to get past the blocking wall.

Alternatively, maybe the player can move the 'win' rule to the ball's position. The ball is at 2 steps left, which would be (-2,0). If I can move the 'win' rule from (0,1) to (-2,0), then the ball becomes win, and the player can go get the ball instead. To move the 'win' rule, the player needs to be adjacent to it and it's not stop. The 'win' rule is at 2 steps right and 1 step up from the player's position. So from (0,0), moving right to (1,0), then right to (2,0), then up to (2,1), which is where the 'win' rule is. Then pick up the 'win' rule and move it left to the ball's position (-2,0).

So the steps would be: right, right, up, take 'win' (but how is that represented in actions?), then move left, left to reach the ball. But the actions are up, down, left, right, idle. So moving the 'win' text block would require moving the player to be adjacent to it, then moving in the direction of where to place it, releasing it. But the available actions don't include picking up or placing objects explicitly. The actions are movement, so the player has to move next to the text block and then move in the direction where they want to place it, effectively dragging it.

So to move the 'win' rule from (2,1) to (-2,0), the player would need to move from (0,0) to (2,1), then move left twice to (0,1), then down to (0,0), then left to (-1,0), then left to (-2,0), placing the 'win' there. Then the active rule becomes 'ball is win', so the player can go get the ball at (-2,0).

But this requires multiple steps. The immediate action would be to move right, then right, then up to reach the 'win' rule.

Alternatively, maybe the player can directly move to the key's position by moving up first. But the wall is blocking that path. So moving right seems necessary.

In the current observation, the player's available actions are up, down, left, right, idle. The best immediate action to start moving towards the key by going around the wall would be to move right.

Let's try to figure out what to do here. The active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". So, normally, I need to get the key to make it the win condition, right? But the key is positioned somewhere, and there might be walls blocking the way. Let me look at the objects on the map.

From the observation, the key is 2 steps down. Wait, the key's position is described as ""key 2 steps down"". But where am I currently located? The observation doesn't explicitly say where Baba is. Hmm, maybe I need to infer based on the other objects. Let's see, the rule `baba` is at 9 steps to the left and 5 steps down, but that's part of the rule itself, not Baba's position. Wait, the ""baba"" object is probably where the player is. Let me check the objects again.

Looking at the objects list: there's a ""rule `baba` 9 step to the left and 5 steps down"", but that's a text block, not the actual Baba. The actual Baba should be the player's position. Wait, in Baba Is You, the player is typically represented by the ""BABA"" text block that's made ""YOU"" via a rule. Since the active rule is ""baba is you"", that means the Baba text block is the player. So where is that Baba text block located?

Looking at the objects, the rule `baba` is at 9 steps to the left and 5 steps down. But that's part of the rule, not the player's position. Oh, wait, maybe the player's position is not listed separately. Maybe I need to figure it out based on the other objects. Alternatively, perhaps the player is at the position of the ""baba"" rule that's active. But no, the rules are separate from the player's position.

This is a bit confusing. Let me try to visualize the map. The key is 2 steps down. Let's see, the walls are spread out to the left and down. The door is at 1 step to the left and 1 step down. The key is at 2 steps down. So if I'm current at a position somewhere, I need to navigate to the key, but there might be walls blocking the path.

Wait, the active rule is ""key is win"", so touching the key should make me win. So the goal is to reach the key. But how to get there? Let's look at the path. The key is at 2 steps down. The door is at 1 step to the left and 1 step down. There's a wall at 4 steps to the left and 1 step down. The ball is at 3 steps to the left. Maybe the player is somewhere in the middle.

Alternatively, perhaps the player's position is not explicitly listed, so I need to deduce it. In previous observations, when the player moved right, their position would change. For example, in earlier steps, moving right would take them closer to the key. But given the current observation, the key is 2 steps down, and the player might be above it, blocked by walls.

Wait, the rule `stop` is 7 steps to the left and 1 step up. The wall is 4 steps to the left and 1 step up. The key is 1 step to the left and 1 step up, then rule `is`, then rule `win` 1 step to the right and 1 step up. So the top row has a wall at 4 steps left, then rule key, is, win. Then below that, the door is at 1 step left and 1 step down, and key is at 2 steps down.

If the player is at the win position (1 step to the right and 1 step up), but that's a rule, not the player's position. Maybe the player is near the key. Alternatively, perhaps the player is at the position of the ""baba"" rule, which is 9 steps left and 5 steps down, but that seems too far. That can't be right.

Alternatively, maybe the player starts in a central position, and each move changes their coordinates. For example, in earlier steps, moving right multiple times got them closer to the key. But now, the key is 2 steps down, and the player might need to move down.

But wait, the active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". So the player is Baba, and touching the key (which is win) should make them win. However, there's a wall at 4 steps left and 1 step down, and another wall at 4 steps left and 2 steps down. The key is at 2 steps down, but behind those walls. So how to get past the walls?

Ah, maybe the walls can be moved if they're not defined as STOP. Wait, the rule ""wall is stop"" is not active here. The active rules are only ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". So walls are not STOP anymore? Wait, no, the initial observation might have had ""wall is stop"", but in the current observation, the active rules are only key is win and baba is you. So does that mean walls are no longer stoppable? Or does the absence of ""wall is stop"" mean they can be moved?

Yes, in Baba Is You, if a rule like ""wall is stop"" is removed, then walls are no longerimmovable. So in this case, since ""wall is stop"" is not an active rule, the walls can be moved over. That's crucial. So the player can push past the walls by moving into them, since they're not STOP anymore.

So the path to the key is: from the player's current position, need to move down past the walls. Let's see, the walls are at 4 steps left and 1 step down, and 4 steps left and 2 steps down. The key is at 2 steps down. So the player needs to move down twice. But how to get past the walls at 4 steps left down?

Wait, the player's position isn't explicitly stated, but based on previous steps, maybe the player is near the top. For example, in earlier observations, after moving right multiple times, the player was getting closer to the key. But in the latest observation, the key is 2 steps down, and the player needs to move down.

Assuming the player can move down past the walls because walls are not STOP, the action would be to move down twice. However, the observation might have the player at a position where they can directly move down to the key.

Alternatively, perhaps the player needs to move right or left to reposition themselves to avoid the walls. Let's think: if the player is at a position where moving down would hit a wall, but since walls can be moved through, they can just walk over them. So the path is clear down to the key.

In that case, the best action is to move down towards the key. But let me check the objects again. The key is at 2 steps down. The door is at 1 step left and 1 step down. The wall is at 4 steps left and 1 step down. So if the player is to the right of the wall at 4 steps left, moving down would take them past the wall. But if the player is on the same column as the wall, they might need to move left or right to avoid it.

Alternatively, maybe the player is at the position of the ""win"" rule, which is 1 step to the right and 1 step up. From there, moving down once would reach the door at 1 step left and 1 step down, then down again to the key. But the door's position is 1 step left and 1 step down. So if the player is at the win position (1 step right, 1 step up), moving down twice would reach the key.

But how does the player get to the win position in the first place? Maybe they need to move right from their current position. Wait, in the current observation, the rule `win` is at 1 step to the right and 1 step up. If the player can reach that position, then moving down would get them to the key. But how to get there?

Alternatively, the player might already be near the key. Let's try to reconstruct the map. Let's assume the player is at the position of the ""baba"" rule, which is 9 steps left and 5 steps down, but that seems too far. That can't be right. More likely, the player's position is not listed separately, and we have to infer it based on the objects.

Alternatively, perhaps the player starts in a central position, and each move changes their coordinates. For example, moving right increases the x-coordinate, moving up decreases the y-coordinate, etc. But without knowing the player's starting position, it's tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is the win condition, and the player needs to move to the key's position. Since the key is 2 steps down, the action would be to move down. But need to confirm if there's a wall in the way.

Looking at the walls: there's a wall at 4 steps left and 1 step down, and another at 4 steps left and 2 steps down. The key is at 2 steps down. So if the player is at a position where moving down would go through those walls, but since walls are not STOP, the player can move through them. Therefore, the action should be to move down towards the key.

So the best action is to move down once to reach the key's position, which is the win condition.

Let's try to figure out what to do here. The active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". So, the goal is probably to get the key because it's defined as win. But how?

Looking at the current observation, the objects on the map are a bit spread out. Let me parse them. The player (Baba) is at position referenced by the rules: rule `baba` is 9 steps to the left and 4 steps down. So, Baba's position is 9 left, 4 down from where? Maybe the center? Not sure, but the key is at 1 step down. Wait, the key is 1 step down from where? The rule `key` is at 1 step down. But the player might be somewhere else.

The walls are all to the left, so maybe the path is blocked on the left. The key is down, but there's a wall at 4 steps to the left and 1 step down. Wait, the key is at 1 step down, but there's a wall at 4 left and 1 down. So maybe the player needs to move down to reach the key. But how to get past the walls?

The rules mention ""stop"" which makes things immovable. So, any object with ""stop"" can't be moved. The player is Baba, and since ""baba is you"", the player can move unless stopped. The walls are ""wall is stop"", so they block movement. But in the current rules, ""wall is stop"" isn't active anymore? Wait, looking at the active rules: only ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". So maybe the walls are no longer stop? Wait, no, the active rules are the ones that are currently in effect. The original walls might have had ""wall is stop"", but if that rule is moved or changed, then walls aren't stop anymore. Wait, but in the current observation, the active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". So the wall's property might have changed. Hmm, this is confusing.

Wait, the tips say that if a rule is moved, it's no longer active. So if the ""wall is stop"" rule was moved or destroyed, then walls are not stop anymore. But in the current observation, the active rules don't include ""wall is stop"". So maybe the walls are passable now? That would change things. So the player can move through walls if the ""stop"" rule is removed. So the strategy would be to go towards the key, which is 1 step down. But how to get there? Let me check the path.

The player is at 9 steps left and 4 steps down. The key is at 1 step down. So the player needs to move down 3 steps. But between them and the key, there's a wall at 4 steps left and 1 step down. Wait, but if walls are not stop anymore, then the player can walk through them. So moving down directly towards the key should be possible. But let's confirm the positions.

The key is at 1 step down. The player is at 9 left, 4 down. So to get to the key, which is 1 step down, the player needs to move down three times. But the wall is at 4 left and 1 down. If the walls are passable, then moving down past that wall is okay. But the player's position is 9 left, 4 down. So moving down would take them to 9 left, 5 down? Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the coordinates. The observation says ""wall 4 step to the left and 1 step down"" from what? Maybe the coordinates are relative to the player's position. Hmm, this is a bit unclear. Alternatively, maybe all positions are relative to a central point.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is directly below the player. If the player is at 9 left, 4 down, and the key is at 1 step down, then moving down once would put them at 9 left, 5 down, but the key is at 1 step down, which is perhaps closer. I think I'm getting confused with the coordinate system here.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is nearby. Let me list out the objects again:

- rule `stop` is 7 steps left and 2 up
- wall 4 left and 2 up
- rule `key` 1 left and 2 up
- rule `is` 2 up
- rule `win` 1 right and 2 up
- rule `wall` 9 left and 1 up
- rule `is` 8 left and 1 up
- wall 4 left and 1 up
- ball 3 left and 1 up
- wall 4 left
- rule `door` 1 left
- wall 4 left and 1 down
- key 1 down
- wall 4 left and 2 down
- wall 4 left and 3 down
- rule `baba` 9 left and 4 down
- rule `is` 8 left and 4 down
- rule `you` 7 left and 4 down
- wall 4 left and 4 down

The player is at rule `baba` which is 9 left and 4 down. So the player's position is (assuming center is 0,0), perhaps at (-9, -4). The key is at 1 down, which would be (-9, -5)? Or maybe the key is at (0, -1) relative to the player? This is confusing. Maybe the coordinates are relative to the player's position. For example, ""rule `key` 1 step down"" means it's one step down from the player's current position. So if the player is at (0,0), the key is at (0, -1). But then the wall at 4 left and 1 down would be at (-4, -1), which is blocking the path down. But if walls are not stop anymore, the player can walk through them. So moving down from (0,0) to (0,-1) would get the key. But in this case, the key is directly below. So the action should be down.

But wait, in the previous steps, the assistant kept moving right, but maybe that's because the walls were blocking. But if ""wall is stop"" is no longer active, then moving through walls is possible. So the correct action now is to move down to get the key, which is defined as win. So pressing down once should pick up the key and achieve the win condition.
