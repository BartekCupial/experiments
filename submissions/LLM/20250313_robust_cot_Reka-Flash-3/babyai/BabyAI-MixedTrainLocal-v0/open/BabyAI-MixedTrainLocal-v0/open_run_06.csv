0,turn right,"<reasoning>
The current observation says there's a wall 3 steps forward, a wall 3 steps left, and a purple key 2 steps right. My goal is to open the door, which I assume is somewhere else not directly mentioned here.

First, I need to figure out where the key is in relation to me. The key is 2 steps to the right. But how am I facing right now? The observation doesn't mention my current direction. That's a problem. Without knowing which way I'm facing, determining the exact direction to turn might be tricky. Wait, maybe the walls can help. If there's a wall 3 steps forward and another 3 steps left, maybe my current direction is such that forward is blocked by a wall, and left is also blocked. Let me visualize this. If I'm facing north, then forward would be north, and left would be west. But there's a wall both north and west. Then the key is 2 steps to the right. If right is east, then east has the key. But how do I get there?

Alternatively, maybe I should first check my direction. Since the walls are in front and left, perhaps I'm facing a direction where left is another wall. Let's assume I'm facing north. Then forward (north) is a wall, left (west) is a wall, so right would be east. The key is 2 steps east. So to get to the key, I need to turn right (east) and then go forward two steps. But how do I pick it up? Once I reach the key, I can pick it up. Then I need to go back to the door, but the door's location isn't mentioned here. But since the goal is to open the door, perhaps the key is required for that door. So first, I need to get the key.

So the steps would be: turn right (to face east), then go forward two steps to reach the key, then pick it up. Then, from there, maybe move in another direction towards the door. But first, let's focus on getting the key. The current observation has the key 2 steps right. So if I turn right, I'm facing the direction where the key is. Then go forward two steps. Once there, pick up the key.

So the first action should be to turn right. Let me check the possible actions: turn left, turn right, go forward, etc. Yes, turning right would align me to face east, allowing me to go forward towards the key. Then go forward twice. But the user might expect a single action first. Since the observation is initial, the first step is to turn right to face the direction of the key. That makes sense. So the chosen action is turn right. Then next steps would be go forward twice, then pick up. But the user wants only one action here. So the first action must be turning right to face the key's location.

 <sep> human:","a wall 3 steps left
a locked purple door 4 steps forward
a purple key 2 steps forward",0,False
1,go forward,"<reasoning>
The user is in a navigation game where the goal is to open a door. The possible actions are turn left, turn right, go forward, pick up, drop, and toggle.

Looking at the current observation: there's a wall 3 steps left, a locked purple door 4 steps forward, and a purple key 2 steps forward. 

First, I need to figure out the agent's current direction. From the previous observation, the agent turned right. Let me think: the initial observation had a wall 3 steps forward and 3 steps left, and a purple key 2 steps right. After turning right, the agent's new direction would be to their original right. Now, the current observation shows a wall 3 steps left (so the agent is now facing east, maybe?), a locked door 4 steps forward, and the key 2 steps forward. Wait, if the agent turned right from their original direction, then their new forward would be east. So, the key is 2 steps in front of them (east), and the door is 4 steps forward (still east but further ahead). The wall to the left would be north? Hmm, maybe not. Directions can get tricky here.

The key is 2 steps forward, and the door is 4 steps forward. The agent needs to pick up the key first to unlock the door. So the next logical step is to move towards the key. But how? The key is 2 steps forward, so the agent can go forward twice. But wait, between the agent and the key, is there anything? The observation doesn't mention any obstacles between the agent and the key. The locked door is 4 steps forward, which is beyond the key. So perhaps the key is right in front of the agent, 2 steps away. So the agent can go forward once to get closer, then again to reach the key. Once there, they can pick it up. Once the key is picked up, they can go forward to the door and toggle it (use the key to unlock). 

But the problem is that the agent is currently facing the direction where the key is (since the key is 2 steps forward). So the immediate action should be to pick up the key. Wait, no: the agent needs to move to the key's location. Since it's 2 steps forward, the agent can go forward twice to reach it. But the observation says the key is 2 steps forward, so maybe moving forward once would get the agent next to the key. Then, they can pick it up. Alternatively, maybe the key is exactly at one step forward. Wait, the problem is that the observation states the key is 2 steps forward. So the agent needs to move forward twice to reach it. However, the agent's current position is such that moving forward once would get them to a position where the key is 1 step away. Then moving forward again. But after moving forward twice, the agent would be next to the key and can then pick it up. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent can go forward once, then pick up the key. Let's check the observation again. The key is 2 steps forward. So if the agent is at position X, moving forward once takes them to X+1, then moving forward again takes them to X+2, which is where the key is. At X+2, the key is below them, so they can pick it up. So the steps would be: go forward, go forward, pick up. But perhaps the agent can go forward once, then pick up. Wait, the description of the pick up action is ""pick up the object below you"". So if the agent is one step away from the key, moving forward would place them adjacent to the key, but the key is below them. Wait, maybe the key is on the ground in front of them. So when they move forward, they step onto the tile where the key is, and then they can pick it up. 

So in the current observation, the key is 2 steps forward. The agent is facing the direction of the key. So the correct sequence is to move forward once, then again, then pick up. But the problem is that the user is asking for the next action, not the entire sequence. So the first action should be to move forward towards the key. But the agent needs to get to the key's position. Since the key is 2 steps away, the agent should go forward first. After that, they would be 1 step away, then go forward again, and then pick up. But in the current observation, the key is still 2 steps away, so the immediate action is to go forward. Alternatively, maybe the agent can go forward once, then pick up. Wait, no, because if the key is 2 steps forward, moving forward once would make it 1 step away. Then, the agent would need to go forward again to reach it. So the first action should be to go forward. 

Wait, but perhaps the key is in front of the agent but not necessarily requiring two steps. The description says ""2 steps right"" in the previous observation. Then after turning right, the key is now 2 steps forward. So the agent needs to move forward twice to reach the key. Therefore, the first action would be to go forward. Then again, then pick up. 

So the next step is to go forward to approach the key. Therefore, the chosen action is go forward. But let me check if there's any reason not to. The observation doesn't mention any obstacles between the agent and the key. The door is 4 steps forward, which is beyond the key. So moving forward is safe. So the best action here is to move forward towards the key. Once the agent is next to the key (after moving forward once), then they can pick it up. But since the key is 2 steps away, the first action is to go forward. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent can directly pick up the key if they are adjacent. But according to the observation, the key is 2 steps away, so moving forward is required. Therefore, the correct action is to go forward.

2,pick up,"<reasoning>
Let's see the current observation again. The player is facing a locked purple door that's 3 steps forward, and the purple key is now just 1 step forward. The wall is 3 steps to the left. The goal is to open the door, so the key must be used here.

First, the agent needs to reach the key. Previously, they moved forward to get closer to the key. Now the key is 1 step forward. So the next logical step is to go forward once more to pick up the key. Once picked up, they can then move forward towards the door and toggle it to open. But the immediate action needed here is to pick up the key that's right in front of them. Let me check the possible actions again. The actions are turn left, turn right, go forward, pick up, drop, toggle. Since the key is 1 step forward, moving forward once would put the agent right next to the key. But wait, in the last observation, after moving forward, the key is now 1 step forward. So if the agent goes forward again, they would be at the key's position. Then they can pick it up. That makes sense. So the correct action here is 'pick up' because the key is directly in front, only one step away. After picking it up, the next step would be to move towards the door and toggle it once they have the key. But right now, the immediate action is to pick up the key.

Let's see what needs to be done here. The agent is carrying a purple key, and in front of them is a locked purple door. The goal is to open the door, so the logical next step is to use the key on the door. The key is already picked up, so now the action should be to toggle the door. Toggling the door when holding the correct key should unlock and open it. The other options like turning or moving forward don't make sense here since the key is already in possession and the door is directly forward. So the correct action is to toggle the door.

Let's see. The current observation says I'm carrying a purple key, there's a wall three steps to the left, and a locked purple door three steps forward. The goal is to open the door. The last action was toggle, which didn't work because the door was locked. The key is already picked up, so I need to use the key on the door.

But wait, how does the game work? The previous steps showed that after picking up the key, toggling the door didn't open it. Maybe I need to be in front of the door when toggling? Let me check the previous interactions. 

In the last step, after picking up the key, the user toggled the door, but the door was still locked. The observation remained the same. Oh, right, maybe the key needs to be used somehow before toggling the door. But how? The actions available are turn, go forward, pick up, drop, and toggle. Once the key is picked up, perhaps I need to go forward to the door again and then toggle it while holding the key. Wait, in the current observation, the door is still three steps forward. So maybe I need to move closer to the door again. Wait, in the previous steps, after picking up the key, the user was already at one step forward from the door, but maybe they need to be directly in front of it to toggle. Or perhaps the key has to be in the inventory when toggling the door. Let me think. The game might require that you have the key to unlock the door, so toggling it while holding the key should open it. But in the previous attempt, toggling didn't work. Maybe I made a mistake in the action sequence. Let me retrace:

1. Turn right to face the direction where the key was.
2. Go forward until the key is picked up (since it was 2 steps right then 1 step forward after turning right).
3. Pick up the key.
4. Then, go forward again towards the door. Wait, in the second observation, after picking up the key, the door was 4 steps forward, then 3 steps forward. So after picking up the key, maybe the agent needs to move closer to the door. But in the user's last action, they picked up the key, then toggled, but the door remained locked. So perhaps the agent needs to be standing directly in front of the door, one step away, to toggle it successfully. Let me check the current observation: the door is three steps forward. So after picking up the key, the agent needs to move two more steps forward to be in front of the door. Then, toggle again. But the current observation says the agent is carrying the key, wall left, door three steps forward. So the correct next action is to go forward twice more? Wait, but the agent can only take one action per turn. So first, go forward once to get to two steps forward. Then again to get to one step forward. Then toggle. But in the current state, the door is three steps forward. So the agent needs to move forward twice. Wait, but in the observation after picking up the key, the door was at 3 steps forward. So the agent must be two steps away. So the correct action is to go forward again. Let me confirm:

After the user's previous action of ""pick up"", the observation updated to the agent carrying the key, door at 3 steps forward. So the agent is at 2 steps forward from the door. Wait, no. Let's break down the steps:

- Initially, the key was 2 steps right. The agent turned right, then went forward until reaching the key (assuming each ""go forward"" moves one step). Then picked it up. Now, after picking up, the agent is at the position where the key was, which is 2 steps right and maybe 1 step forward or something. But the door is 3 steps forward. So perhaps the agent's position after picking up the key is still two steps away from the door. Therefore, they need to go forward twice more. But in the current observation, the door is three steps forward, so the agent is two steps away. So moving forward once would bring them to two steps forward, then another forward to one step. But each action can only be one step. So first action: go forward. Then, next action: go forward again. Then toggle. But in the current observation, the agent is still three steps from the door. So the correct next action is to go forward. Only after moving closer can the door be toggled successfully. Therefore, the agent needs to move forward once to get to two steps away. Then toggle again while holding the key. But in the previous attempt, toggling at three steps didn't work. So the key is necessary, but proximity might also matter. Hence, the correct sequence is: after picking up the key, go forward until in front of the door (one step), then toggle. Therefore, in the current state, door is three steps forward. So the agent needs to go forward twice. Wait, but each ""go forward"" is one step. So first action: go forward. Now door is two steps away. Next action: go forward again. Now door is one step. Then toggle. But in the current observation, after picking up the key, the door is three steps forward. So the immediate next action should be ""go forward"" to get to two steps. Then another ""go forward"" to get to one step, then ""toggle"". But since the user is asking for the next action based on the current observation, which shows the door three steps away, the correct action is ""go forward"" to approach the door. Only then, when the agent is one step away, toggling will work. Therefore, the agent should move closer first. Hence, the chosen action is ""go forward"".

Let me think through this step by step. The agent is carrying a purple key, and there's a locked purple door 2 steps forward. Previously, the agent toggled the door but it didn't open, so now in the current observation, the door is still locked. The key is already picked up, so the next logical step is to use the key on the door. The 'toggle' action is used to interact with objects in front, so toggling the door again with the key should unlock it. But why isn't it working yet? Maybe the door needs to be toggled a second time after picking up the key. Let me check the previous interactions. The agent toggled the door once before picking up the key, which didn't work. Then after picking up the key, they toggled again, but the observation still shows the door as locked. So perhaps the correct approach is to approach the door again (go forward) to ensure they're directly in front of it, then toggle once more with the key. Alternatively, maybe the key needs to be in hand before toggling. Since the agent already has the key, toggling again should work. So the next action should be 'toggle' to unlock the door. The observation hasn't changed to unlocked yet, so repeating the toggle is necessary. The agent should toggle the door again to unlock it.

The goal is to open the door. Let's check the current observation. I have a purple key, there's a locked purple door 2 steps forward, and a wall to the left. The previous steps were: I turned right to face the direction of the key, went forward twice, picked up the key, then approached the door. When I toggled the door earlier, it didn't open because it's still locked. So the key must be needed to unlock it.

Wait, in the last action, I toggled the door again when it was locked, but I already have the key. Maybe the door requires the key to be inserted first. The problem might be that I toggled the door without using the key. So maybe I need to approach the door again, use the key on it by toggling, which would unlock it. But how does the game work here? Do I need to pick up the key again? No, I'm already carrying it. So the correct action would be to toggle the door again, which now that I have the key, should unlock it. But the observation still says the door is locked. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I need to be right in front of the door. Let me check the observation again. The door is 2 steps forward. So I should move closer. Wait, in the previous step, I toggled the door when it was 2 steps forward, but perhaps I need to be adjacent to it. Let me check: when the door is 2 steps forward, toggling it might not work because I'm not next to it. So I need to go forward once more to be right in front of the door. Then, toggle it again with the key. That should unlock it. So the correct action now is to go forward to reduce the distance to 1 step, then toggle. But the current observation says the door is 2 steps forward, so moving forward once would make it 1 step. Then toggle again. Let me confirm: the current observation is locked door 2 steps forward. So the next step should be to go forward to get closer. Then toggle. That makes sense. So the action should be go forward.

The player needs to open the door. Let's look at the current observation. The agent is carrying a purple key. There's a wall to the left, 3 steps away. The locked purple door is just 1 step forward.

Previously, the agent tried toggling the door when it was 2 steps away and then went forward each time. Now the door is 1 step forward, still locked. Since the door is locked, the only way to unlock it is by using the key. The key is already in the agent's inventory, so the next logical step is to use the toggle action on the door while facing it. Toggling the door when the key is already held should unlock it, allowing the door to be opened. Going forward again after unlocking would open the door. But wait, the current observation still shows the door as locked. The agent needs to toggle it to unlock. So the correct action here is to toggle the door, which, with the key in hand, should unlock it, and then the agent can proceed forward. But since the door is 1 step forward, toggling it now should work. The previous attempts were toggling when it wasn't close enough? Or maybe the door requires being adjacent. Since the door is now 1 step forward, toggling it now with the key should unlock it. So the action should be toggle.
