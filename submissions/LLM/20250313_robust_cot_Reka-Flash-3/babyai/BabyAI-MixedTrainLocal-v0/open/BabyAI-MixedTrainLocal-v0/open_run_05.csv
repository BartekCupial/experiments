0,turn left,"<reasoning>
Let's see. The current observation says there's a wall 3 steps forward and a wall 1 step to the right. So, wherever I am right now, if I go forward three steps, I hit a wall. And if I turn right once, there's another wall one step ahead.

Hmm, the goal is to open the door. But right now, I can't see any door mentioned. The available actions are turning left, right, going forward, picking up, dropping, or toggling an object in front. 

Since there's a wall in front (3 steps), going forward immediately might not work. Maybe I need to check other directions. If turning left or right reveals a path that leads to the door, that would be better. Let me think. If I turn left, maybe there's a way forward. Or perhaps turning right and then moving forward? But the observation says a wall is 1 step right, but that's after turning right from the current position. Wait, the observation is structured as ""a wall 3 steps forward"" and ""a wall 1 step right"". So current facing direction: let's assume I'm facing north. Then, forward is north, right would be east. So 3 steps north is a wall, 1 step east is a wall.

So to explore, maybe I should turn left (which would be west) and see if there's a path. Or turn right (east) but that's blocked. Alternatively, maybe the door is somewhere else. But the problem is I don't know the map. So the safest first step is to turn in a direction that might lead away from the immediate walls.

So turning left or right. Let's try turning left first. That would make me face west. If I go forward from there, maybe there's no wall. Or maybe another wall. But since the observation doesn't mention anything else, maybe I should just turn left and see. Alternatively, turn right, but that's blocked. Wait, turning right would make me face east, and there's a wall 1 step east. So going forward after turning right isn't an option. So better to turn left. Then go forward and check. But the problem is, the initial observation is given, so after turning left, the new observation would change. But since I can't see the future, I have to make a move based on current info. 

Alternatively, maybe the door is behind the walls? Unlikely. So perhaps the first step is to turn left to explore another direction and then proceed. Alternatively, toggle something, but there's no object mentioned in front. The observations only mention walls. So toggling wouldn't do anything here. So the possible actions are turn left, right, go forward (but 3 steps forward is a wall, so moving forward once isn't possible?), wait, the observation says ""a wall 3 steps forward"" which might mean that if you go forward once, there's a wall three steps ahead. Wait, maybe the observation is that straight ahead, there's a wall three steps away, but you can only move one step at a time. So if I go forward once, I would be two steps away from the wall. But the observation says ""a wall 3 steps forward"" perhaps meaning that if you move forward three steps, you hit the wall. But maybe moving one step forward would still be safe. Wait, the description isn't entirely clear. But the key is that the current observation states there's a wall three steps forward, so moving forward once might not immediately hit the wall, but eventually, after three steps, you would. But perhaps the game allows moving forward one step at a time, and the wall is three steps away, so moving forward once is possible. However, without knowing the exact game mechanics, it's safer to assume that moving forward directly into a wall isn't allowed. So maybe I can't go forward yet. 

Given that, the best initial action is to turn left or right to change direction and explore other paths. Since turning right leads to a wall in one step, turning left might be better. So I should choose to turn left. That way, I can then attempt to move forward in the new direction, which might not have walls. So the chosen action is turn left.

1,go forward,"<reasoning>
The observation says there's a wall 3 steps right and a yellow key 4 steps forward. So, my current facing direction must be such that to my right is a wall, and in front of me 4 steps is where the key is.

First, the goal is to open the door, and I need the key. So I need to pick up the yellow key. To get to the key, which is 4 steps forward, I should just go forward four times. But maybe there's a more efficient way. Wait, but the key is directly in front, so maybe I can approach it step by step.

But let me check the possible actions. The available actions are turn left, turn right, go forward, pick up, drop, toggle. Since the key is in front, the first thing I need to do is move towards it. So the immediate action should be to go forward. However, the key is 4 steps away. But each go forward action moves one step. So I need to go forward four times. But the problem is, after each go forward, the observation might change. For example, after moving forward once, the key might be 3 steps forward, then 2, etc., until I pick it up.

But in the current observation, it's 4 steps forward. So the first step is to go forward once. Then in the next observation, the key would be 3 steps forward. Repeating this until I reach the key to pick it up. But maybe there's a way to optimize. Wait, the instructions mention that it doesn't make sense to repeat the same action if the observation doesn't change. So if I keep going forward and the key's distance decreases each time, that's fine. So the initial action should be to go forward to get closer to the key.

2,go forward,"<reasoning>
The observation says there's a wall 3 steps to the right and a yellow key 3 steps forward. The key is now one step closer than before.

Earlier, the user was told to go forward to get the key. But now, after moving forward, the key is 3 steps away again? Wait, maybe I need to check the sequence again. Previous steps: first, the user turned left because there was a wall forward and a wall to the right. Then they went forward to approach the key. Now, after moving forward, the key is 3 steps ahead again. That seems a bit odd. Maybe there's a mistake in the observation, but assuming it's correct, I need to figure out the best action.

The key is in front, so the next logical step would be to go forward again. But the user might have already tried that. Wait, in the previous step, after going forward, the key was 4 steps forward, then after moving, it's now 3 steps. So maybe each time they go forward, the key is getting closer. If the key is 3 steps forward now, then going forward once more would get them to the key. But then they need to pick it up.

Alternatively, maybe they need to face the correct direction. Wait, initially, the wall to the right was 1 step right. Then they turned left, so now their direction is changed. Perhaps they need to ensure they're facing the direction of the key. If the key is 3 steps forward, then moving forward three times should reach it. But after each move, the key's distance decreases by one. So after the first 'go forward', it was 4 steps, then 3. So next step would be to go forward again. But the user's actions need to be efficient. However, the tip says not to repeat the same action if the observation doesn't change. In this case, moving forward is necessary because the key is in front. So even if the distance decreases each time, moving forward each step until reaching the key is necessary. Therefore, the correct action here is 'go forward' again. Once they pick it up, they can use it to open the door. But since the current observation still shows the key 3 steps forward, the next action should be to move closer to it. So the action is 'go forward'.

3,go forward,"<reasoning>
The current observation says there's a wall 3 steps to the right and a yellow key 2 steps forward. The previous actions were turning left, going forward twice, and now the key is two steps ahead.

So, the agent already picked up the key? Wait, no. Last time, after moving forward twice, the key was 3 steps forward, then 2 steps. So the agent moved closer each time. Now the key is two steps forward. To get it, the agent needs to go forward once more. Because each ""go forward"" action takes one step. So after being 3 steps away, moving forward twice would get to 1 step, then another to 0, meaning the key is now at the same position. Then the agent can pick it up.

So the next step is to go forward once to reach the key. Once there, the next action would be to pick up the key. But according to the current observation, the key is still 2 steps forward. So the immediate action should be ""go forward"" again. After that, another ""go forward"" would bring the key to the agent's current position, allowing them to pick it up. But since the user is asking for the next action based on the current observation (key is 2 steps forward), the correct action is to move closer. 

So the answer should be ""go forward"". Because they need to get within one step to pick it up. Once they do that, the next step is to pick it up. But for now, the key is still two steps away, so moving forward is the right move.

Let's see. The current observation says there's a wall 3 steps to the right and a yellow key 1 step forward. The previous steps came from moving forward three times to get closer to the key.

So now the key is just one step ahead. The next logical step is to pick up the key. The actions available include 'pick up', which allows me to grab the object in front. Since the key is right in front of me (1 step), using 'pick up' should work here. Once I have the key, maybe I can toggle the door later, but right now the priority is getting the key. Need to make sure I don't mistake any other objects. The wall on the right doesn't matter here; the key is the target. So the correct action is 'pick up' to retrieve the key.

5,toggle,"<reasoning>
The agent has picked up the yellow key. Now the observation shows that there's a wall 3 steps forward and a wall 3 steps right again. The key is no longer in front, so maybe the next step is to find where the door is. Since the key was directly in front earlier, perhaps the door is in another direction. The agent turned left before moving forward towards the key. Maybe now they should turn another direction to face where the door might be.

Looking at the current observation, after picking up the key, the agent is facing a wall in front and to the right. The only possible moves are to turn left or right again. Turning left again would make the agent face a direction where maybe the door is not behind a wall. Alternatively, turning right would face the same wall again. So turning left seems better. Then, the agent can move forward towards the door, assuming the door is in that direction. The key was probably near the door, so after getting the key, moving forward in the same direction (now that the key is picked up) might lead to the door. But wait, after picking up the key, the observation shows the walls are back. Maybe the door is in another direction. Let me think. The previous steps: agent turned left, moved towards the key which was getting closer each time. Once the key is picked up, the walls reappear, so the agent is back to a position where forward and right are walls. So maybe the door is behind the agent? But turning around would require turning right twice. Alternatively, the agent needs to toggle an object. Since the key is now being carried, perhaps the door requires the key to be toggled. But how to get to the door. If the agent turns left again, maybe they can face a new direction where the door is. Let me map this mentally. Original position: facing a wall 3 forward and 1 right. Turn left, now facing north (assuming initial direction was south). Move forward three times to get the key. Then after picking up, walls are back. So now facing north again, walls to the right (east) and forward (north). To get to the door, maybe the agent needs to turn left again (now facing west), then move forward. But if there's a wall, that wouldn't work. Alternatively, perhaps the door is in the direction the agent came from. So turning around would require two right turns (turn right twice to face south). Then move forward towards where the door might be. But without knowing the map, it's tricky. However, the tip says to toggle the object in front once you have the key. So maybe after picking up the key, the agent needs to face the door and toggle it. But how to get there. Since current observation has walls in front and right, the only options are to turn left or right. Let's try turning left. So after turning left, the agent would face west. Then move forward. If there's a door there, toggling it would open. But the current observation after picking up the key shows walls again, so maybe moving forward isn't possible. Alternatively, the agent should toggle something in front. But if there's a wall, toggling it doesn't make sense. So perhaps the correct action is to turn left, then move forward until there's no wall, then toggle. But given the current observation, after picking up the key, the walls are back. So maybe the agent needs to reorient. Turn left, then another left (now facing west), then move forward. If that path isn't blocked, then toggle. But without knowing the layout, I have to go by the previous steps. The key was picked up by moving forward three times after turning left. So the door is probably in the original direction (south?), but the walls are there. Alternatively, the door is behind the agent. So turn right twice to face south, then move forward and toggle. But the problem is, how to get to the door. Since the agent has the key, maybe the door is nearby. The last observation before picking up the key had the key 1 step forward. After picking up, the walls are in front and right again, so the agent is back to a position where moving forward hits a wall. So perhaps the door is to the left or right. The agent turned left initially, so maybe the door is to the left again. Turn left (now facing west), move forward. If there's no wall, then toggle. But according to the current observation, after picking up the key, walls are 3 steps forward and right. So turning left would face a direction where there's a wall 3 steps forward? Or not? Wait, the current observation after picking up is: walls 3 forward and 3 right. So regardless of direction, the walls are there. That can't be right. Wait, maybe when the agent turned left, the walls are in different directions. Let me re-examine the observations. 

First observation: wall 3 forward, wall 1 right. Agent turns left. Then next observation: wall 3 right, yellow key 4 forward. So after turning left, the agent is facing a direction where to the right is a wall (which was the original forward direction), and the key is 4 steps forward. Then the agent moves forward three times, each time the key gets closer. Finally, picks up the key. Now, after picking up, the observation is walls 3 forward and 3 right. So regardless of direction, the walls are 3 steps away. That suggests that the agent is in a position where all directions have walls except where the door is, but the door requires the key. So perhaps the agent is now facing a wall, and the door is behind that wall, which can only be opened by toggling after having the key. But how to get to the door. Since the agent is facing a wall, they need to turn around. So turn right twice (180 degrees) to face the opposite direction. Then move forward until the door is in front, then toggle. But in the current observation, after picking up the key, moving forward would hit a wall. So maybe the agent needs to turn left or right to find a path. Wait, but if turning left or right still has a wall 3 steps away, then the only option is to toggle something. But there's nothing to toggle in front. Unless the door is behind the wall, and toggling it requires the key. So the agent must be facing the door, but blocked by a wall. So the correct action would be to toggle the wall (which doesn't make sense), or perhaps the wall is part of the door. Maybe the door is represented as a wall that can be toggled with the key. So in this case, even though it's described as a wall, toggling it would open the door. But the problem is, the agent is facing a wall, so toggling it would try to open the door. So the action would be to toggle. But the tip says to toggle when you want to interact with an object in front. Since the agent has the key, toggling the wall (which is the door) should open it. So the correct action is toggle.

6,turn left,"<reasoning>
The current observation says I'm carrying a yellow key and there are walls 3 steps forward and 3 steps right. The goal is to open the door, so I need to figure out where the door is.

Earlier, the user had me pick up the yellow key and then toggle. But after toggling, the observation didn't change. Wait, maybe the door is in a different direction? Let me think.

Since the walls are blocking my forward and right paths, maybe the door is behind me or to my left? But how do I know? The key is yellow, which might correspond to a door that requires a yellow key. But if the door isn't in the current direction, I need to turn around.

Looking back at previous steps: initially, there was a wall 3 steps forward and a wall 1 step right. Then I turned left, moved forward towards the yellow key, picked it up, toggled, but nothing happened. Maybe the door is in the opposite direction now. Since I've been moving forward towards the key, which was initially 4 steps away, then 3, 2, 1. After picking up the key, I toggled, but the walls are still there. 

Hmm, perhaps the door isn't in front of me anymore. Maybe I need to turn around. If the walls are still 3 steps forward and right, maybe turning around would face me a different direction where the door is. Let me check the previous observations again. After picking up the key, the observation showed walls 3 steps forward and right. Then when I toggled, there was no change. So the door must not be in front of me. 

I need to find a way to interact with the door. The toggle action is used to manipulate objects in front. But if there's a wall there, toggling doesn't make sense. So maybe I should turn around to face a different direction where the door is located. Since the key was picked up, which is probably by or near the door, perhaps the door is behind the key's location. But moving backward might not be possible if there's a wall. 

Wait, in the last observation after picking up the key, the walls are still 3 steps forward and right. So if I turn left again, that's the direction I came from. Or turn right, which was a wall earlier. Maybe I need to turn around by turning left twice or right twice. 

Alternatively, maybe the door is to the left or right after picking up the key. But since the walls are still 3 steps in those directions, that's not helpful. 

Another thought: Maybe the door is in a different area that I haven't explored yet. But since the current observation only shows walls in forward and right, perhaps I need to move in another direction. Wait, but how? If I'm facing forward and there's a wall, turning left or right would still have walls. Unless I turned around. 

Wait, in the initial steps, after turning left, I moved forward towards the key. Then after picking up the key, toggling didn't work. So perhaps the door is behind me. Let me try turning around. If I turn left twice (180 degrees), then my forward direction would be where I came from. But there might be a door there now. 

Alternatively, maybe the door requires the key, and after picking it up, I need to be in front of the door to toggle it. But if the current observation still has walls in front and right, then I must be facing the wrong direction. 

So the possible actions are turn left, turn right, go forward (into a wall), pick up (already have the key), drop (don't need to), or toggle (no door here). Since going forward or turning right would hit a wall, the best options are to turn left or right again to change direction. 

If I turn left from my current facing, that would face me towards where the key was. But if the door is there, maybe toggling again would work. But earlier toggling didn't change anything. Alternatively, turning around (left twice) to face the original starting direction. 

Alternatively, maybe the door is to the left of my current left turn. Hmm. This is a bit confusing. But given the options, the only safe actions that don't hit walls are turning left or right. Since I already toggled once and there's no change, maybe I need to reposition. 

I think the best action here is to turn left again, perhaps to face a different direction where the door might be. Or maybe turn right. Wait, but the current walls are 3 steps right. If I turn right, I'm facing a wall. So turning left is better. 

Alternatively, since the key was picked up, maybe the door is in another part of the environment not yet observed. But based on the current observation, the only possible actions without hitting walls are turning left or toggling. Toggling won't do anything here. 

So the next action should be to turn left to change direction and explore another area where the door might be located.

7,Failed to obtain a valid action from the reasoning.,"<reasoning>
Let me figure out what I need to do next. The current observation says I have a yellow key. There's a wall 4 steps forward, another wall 3 steps right, and a locked yellow door 2 steps left and 4 steps forward.

Hmm, the door is locked and it's a yellow door. I remember that keys usually match the color of the door they unlock. Since I have a yellow key, that must be the one to use for this door. But how do I get to the door? The door is located 2 steps left and 4 steps forward. 

Looking at my current position relative to the door: I need to move left twice and forward four times. But there's a wall 4 steps forward and another wall 3 steps right. Wait, my previous observations showed walls in certain directions. Let me try to visualize the map. 

If the door is 2 steps left and 4 steps forward from my current position, I should first turn to face the direction that leads towards it. Since accessing it requires moving left and forward, maybe I should turn left to face the direction that allows me to move left and then forward. But considering the walls, I need to check the path. 

Alternatively, maybe I should move in a direction that gets me closer to the door without hitting the walls. Let's break down the door's position. If moving left 2 steps and forward 4 steps is needed, perhaps I need to adjust my heading first. 

Wait, my previous actions included turning left after picking up the key. Now, in the current observation, the walls are 4 steps forward and 3 steps right. The door is to the left and forward. So, maybe I should turn around to face a direction that allows me to go left and then forward. 

But turning which way? Let's think about directions. Suppose I'm currently facing a certain direction. If the door is 2 steps left and 4 forward, maybe turning left would face me in a direction where left would be the new forward? Or perhaps I need to turn 180 degrees to face the opposite direction. 

Alternatively, maybe I should first turn left to face a new direction, then move left towards the door. But I need to make sure there's no wall in the way. The current observation mentions a wall 4 steps forward, which is in the direction I'm currently facing. So if I turn left, maybe the wall is still in front? Wait, the observation after picking up the key had a wall 3 steps right, and then after toggling, it still showed the same walls. 

Wait, maybe the walls are in fixed positions relative to the environment. Let me try to reconstruct the map. Let's assume that after picking up the key, I turned left, and now the walls are 4 steps forward and 3 steps right. The door is 2 steps left and 4 steps forward. If I'm facing a direction where left is towards the door's position, then moving left would take me closer. But given that the wall is 4 steps forward, maybe I need to adjust my direction first. 

Alternatively, perhaps I need to move in a way that gets me around the walls. Let me think step by step. 

Current Position: Let's imagine I'm at coordinates (0,0). The door is at (-2,4) because it's 2 steps left (negative x direction) and 4 steps forward (positive y direction). The walls are at 4 steps forward (so y=4) and 3 steps right (x=3). Wait, but walls could be in any direction. Maybe the walls are in the directions I'm facing. For example, if I'm facing north, a wall 4 steps forward would be north, 3 steps right would be east. But the door is 2 steps left (west) and 4 steps forward (north). So from (0,0), moving north 4 would hit a wall, but the door is at (-2,4). That suggests that the door is north 4 and west 2 from my current position. 

Wait, but if moving forward 4 steps is blocked by a wall, how can the door be 4 steps forward and 2 steps left? That seems contradictory. Maybe the walls are in different directions. Let me re-examine the observations. 

In the current observation, after picking up the key and toggling (which probably didn't do anything because the door was locked), the walls are 4 steps forward and 3 steps right. The door is 2 steps left and 4 steps forward. 

So, the door is in the direction that is both forward and left. But if moving forward 4 steps is blocked by a wall, how can the door be 4 steps forward? That doesn't make sense. Unless the wall is in a different direction. Maybe the walls are in different orientations based on my current facing direction. 

Let me try to model this. Suppose I'm facing east. Then, moving forward would be east. The wall 4 steps forward would be 4 steps east. The wall 3 steps right would be 3 steps north (since right from east is north). The door is 2 steps left (west) and 4 steps forward (east). So door position would be (current x -2, current y +4). But moving east 4 steps is blocked by a wall. But the door is 4 steps east and 2 steps west from current position. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the directions. 

Alternatively, maybe the door is 2 steps to the left (west) and 4 steps forward (east) from my current position. So combining those, the door is at (-2,4) if I'm at (0,0) facing east. But moving east 4 steps is blocked by a wall. So how can the door be there? That suggests that maybe the wall is not in the same direction as the door's forward direction. 

This is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I need to adjust my heading. The door is 2 steps left and 4 steps forward. So to reach it, I need to first turn left to face a new direction where moving left gets me towards the door. Wait, if I turn left, then my left direction would be south (if I was facing east). But the door is west and north. Hmm, maybe I need to turn around. 

Alternatively, perhaps I need to turn left twice (180 degrees) to face west, then move forward and left. But I'm not sure. 

Wait, the door is 2 steps left and 4 steps forward. If I can face a direction where left is towards the door's position, then moving left would get me closer. Let me think about turning left once. If turning left makes my forward direction north, then left would be west. So moving left (west) 2 steps and then forward (north) 4 steps would reach the door. But the problem is that moving forward 4 steps might hit the wall. 

Alternatively, maybe the wall is in the direction I'm currently facing. If I turn left, then moving forward (north) 4 steps might not be blocked, but the door is west and north. 

This is a bit complicated. Maybe the best approach is to first turn left to face a direction where moving left gets me towards the door's left position. Then move left twice and forward four times. But I need to check the walls. 

In the current observation, after toggling, the walls are still 4 steps forward and 3 steps right. So if I turn left, my forward direction is now north, and right is west. Then, moving forward 4 steps would be north 4, but the wall is still 4 steps forward (north), which would block that. So I can't move forward north 4 steps. 

Hmm, so the door is 2 steps left and 4 steps forward. But moving forward 4 steps is blocked. That suggests that the door is actually in the direction that is a combination of left and forward, but the forward path is blocked. That doesn't make sense. Maybe the door is behind the wall? 

Wait, perhaps the door is not directly in front but to the side. Let me think differently. Maybe the door is in a adjacent room, and to reach it, I need to move around the walls. 

Alternatively, maybe the key is not needed anymore, but that's unlikely. Since the door is locked and I have the yellow key, the key must be required. 

Wait, perhaps the door is 2 steps left and 4 steps forward from my current position, but the forward direction is blocked by a wall. So I need to move left first, then forward. 

If I turn left, then my left direction is south (assuming I was facing east). Moving left (south) 2 steps would take me to the door's left position, but then moving forward (east) 4 steps would hit the wall. That doesn't work. 

Alternatively, if I turn around (180 degrees), facing west, then left would be south. Moving left (south) 2 steps and forward (west) 4 steps would reach the door's position. But the wall is 3 steps right (which would be east) and 4 steps forward (west). So moving west 4 steps would hit the wall. 

This is really confusing. Maybe I need to use the toggle action again on the door once I'm in front of it. But how to get there? 

Wait, the observation says the door is 2 steps left and 4 steps forward. So perhaps I need to first move left twice, then forward four times. But the wall is 4 steps forward. Unless the wall is not in the same direction. 

Alternatively, maybe the wall is in a different direction, and the door's position is such that after moving left twice, the forward path is clear. 

Alternatively, maybe the walls are in fixed positions relative to the environment, not to my facing direction. For example, there's a wall 4 steps north and 3 steps east. Then the door is 2 steps west and 4 steps north. So from my current position, moving west 2 and north 4 would reach the door. But how to navigate that given my current facing direction. 

I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the possible actions. The key is to get to the door and toggle it. Since the door is locked and I have the yellow key, I need to be in front of the door and then toggle it. 

So the steps would be: turn to face the door, move to it, then toggle. 

Given the current observation, the door is 2 steps left and 4 steps forward. So I need to adjust my heading so that moving forward leads me towards the door. 

Assuming that ""left"" and ""forward"" are relative to my current facing direction. Let's say I'm currently facing north. Then, left would be west. The door is 2 steps west and 4 steps north. So to get there, I need to move west 2 and north 4. But there's a wall 4 steps north (forward), which would block that path. 

Alternatively, if I'm facing east, left is north. The door is 2 steps north and 4 steps east. Moving north 2 and east 4. But moving east 4 is blocked by a wall. 

This suggests that my current facing direction must be such that moving forward 4 steps is towards the wall, and the door is in a different direction. 

Alternatively, maybe the door is in a corridor that requires navigating around the walls. For example, if I turn left, then move forward around the wall. 

Wait, the current walls are 4 steps forward and 3 steps right. So if I turn left, my forward direction is now north, and right is west. The wall is 4 steps forward (north) and 3 steps right (west). The door is 2 steps left (west) and 4 steps forward (north). 

So, if I turn left, facing north, then moving left (west) 2 steps would take me to the door's left position, and moving forward (north) 4 steps would hit the wall. That's not helpful. 

Alternatively, if I turn right, my forward direction is south, right is east. The wall is 3 steps right (east) and 4 steps forward (south). The door is 2 steps left (east) and 4 steps forward (south). So to reach the door, I would need to move left (east) 2 steps and forward (south) 4 steps. But moving east 2 steps from the current position would take me to where the door's left is, but moving forward (south) 4 steps would reach the door. However, the wall is 4 steps forward (south), so that path is blocked. 

This is very confusing. Maybe I need to adjust my approach. Since the door is 2 steps left and 4 steps forward, perhaps I should first move left twice, then move forward four times. But the wall is in the way. 

Alternatively, maybe the door is not directly in front but requires a different path. 

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the door's position. The observation says the door is 2 steps left and 4 steps forward. So combining those, it's a diagonal direction. Maybe I need to move in a way that covers both left and forward steps. For example, moving left twice and forward four times, but encountering a wall. 

Alternatively, perhaps the door is behind the wall. But that doesn't make sense. 

Maybe the key here is to realize that the door is in front of me once I adjust my direction. Wait, but how? 

Alternatively, maybe I need to turn left to face a new direction where moving forward leads me towards the door. Let's try that. If I turn left, then my forward direction is north, left is west. The door is 2 steps left (west) and 4 steps forward (north). But moving forward north 4 steps is blocked by a wall. So that's not possible. 

Alternatively, if I turn right, forward is south, right is east. The door is 2 steps left (east) and 4 steps forward (south). Moving left (east) 2 steps and forward (south) 4 steps. But moving south 4 steps is blocked by a wall. 

Hmm. This is a dead end. Maybe I need to move in a different way. 

Wait, the door is 2 steps left and 4 steps forward. So maybe I can move left twice, then forward four times, but the wall is in the way. But since there's a wall 4 steps forward, that path is blocked. So perhaps I need to find a way around the wall. 

Alternatively, maybe the wall is not in the same direction as the door's forward path. For example, if the wall is 4 steps east, and the door is west and north. 

I think I'm stuck here. Let me recap. I have the yellow key. The door is locked and requires the yellow key. The door's position is 2 steps left and 4 steps forward. The walls are 4 steps forward and 3 steps right. 

The only way to unlock the door is to be in front of it and toggle it. So the plan is: turn to face the door, move to it, then toggle. 

But how to face the door given the walls. 

Wait, maybe I need to turn left, then move forward around the wall. For example, turn left (now facing north), move forward until I can go left (west) towards the door. But the wall is 4 steps forward (north), so moving north any steps would hit the wall. 

Alternatively, turn around (180 degrees) to face west. Then, move forward (west) 4 steps would hit the wall (as per the current observation). No good. 

Turn right (south), then move forward (south) 4 steps (wall), right (east) 3 steps. But the door is 2 steps left and 4 steps forward. If I'm facing south, left is east. So door is 2 steps east and 4 steps south. Moving east 2 and south 4. But moving south 4 is blocked. 

This is really tricky. Maybe the problem is that the door's position is not directly reachable due to the walls, and I need to find a different path. 

Wait, maybe the key is not needed, but that's unlikely. The door is locked, so the key must be used. 

Alternatively, perhaps the door is in a different position. Let me check the previous observations. 

In the last few steps, after picking up the key, the observations showed the door moving closer as the agent moved forward. For example, the door was 2 steps left and 4 forward, then 2 left and 3 forward, etc., until it was 1 step forward. Then after toggling, the observation didn't change, indicating the door was still there but perhaps locked. 

So now, after picking up the key and toggling, the door is still there, and the agent is holding the key. So the next step is to approach the door again. 

But in the current observation, the door is 2 steps left and 4 steps forward. So the agent needs to navigate to that position. 

Assuming that the agent is now facing a direction where moving left and forward leads to the door. 

Wait, perhaps the agent turned left after picking up the key, which changed their facing direction. Let me think about the previous steps. 

After the user's last message, the observation showed the agent carrying the key, walls 4 forward and 3 right, and the door 2 left and 4 forward. The agent's previous action was 'toggle', which probably tried to unlock the door but failed because it was locked. 

Now, the agent needs to get to the door's position. Since the door is 2 left and 4 forward, the agent needs to adjust their heading. 

If the agent is currently facing north (after turning left previously), then left is west. The door is 2 west and 4 north. But moving north 4 is blocked by a wall. So that's not possible. 

Alternatively, if the agent is facing east, left is north. The door is 2 north and 4 east. Moving east 4 is blocked. 

This suggests that the agent's current facing direction is such that moving forward 4 steps is blocked, but the door is in a different direction. 

Perhaps the agent needs to turn around (180 degrees) to face west. Then, left would be south. The door is 2 west and 4 north. From facing west, moving left (south) 2 steps and forward (west) 4 steps would reach the door. But moving west 4 steps is blocked by a wall. 

This is really confusing. Maybe I'm missing something. 

Wait, the observation after toggling says the walls are still 4 steps forward and 3 steps right. So regardless of the agent's facing direction, those walls are in those relative positions. 

Wait, maybe the walls are absolute in the environment, not relative to the agent's orientation. For example, there's a wall to the north 4 steps, east 3 steps, etc","

Your previous output did not contain a valid action. Defaulted to action: go forward

You carry a yellow key
a wall 3 steps forward
a wall 3 steps right
a locked yellow door 2 steps left and 3 steps forward",0,False
8,Failed to obtain a valid action from the reasoning.,"<reasoning>
Let's figure out what to do next. The current observation says I'm carrying a yellow key. There's a wall 3 steps forward and another 3 steps to the right. But now there's also a locked yellow door that's 2 steps left and 3 steps forward.

Hmm, the door is locked, and the key I have is yellow. So the key should match the door. The problem is the door's position. It's 2 steps to the left and 3 steps forward from my current location. Let me visualize this.

My current direction might matter. If I'm facing a certain way, moving forward or left would change the direction relative to the door. From the previous observations, after toggling (which probably tried to open the door but failed because it was locked), I turned left. Now the door is 2 left and 3 forward. 

Wait, when I turned left, my forward direction would now be different. So maybe I need to adjust my position to face the door. Let's see. If the door is 2 steps left and 3 steps forward, I might need to move in that direction. But first, I need to make sure I'm facing the correct way. 

Alternatively, maybe I need to move left twice to get next to the door, then move forward. But I should check the observation again. The door's position is relative to my current position. Let's break it down: 2 steps left and 3 steps forward. So from my current spot, if I turn left, maybe that aligns me to face the direction of the door. 

Wait, after turning left, the forward direction would be to the left relative to my original direction. So if the door is 2 steps left and 3 forward, perhaps after turning left, I need to move forward 3 steps and then left 2? But that might not be the case. Maybe I need to first move left to face the correct direction. 

Alternatively, maybe I should turn right instead. Let me think. If the door is 2 steps left and 3 steps forward, maybe I need to face left and then move forward 3 steps, then left another 2? Or maybe adjust my current orientation. 

Alternatively, maybe I should go forward first to reduce the distance. But the observation says the door is 3 steps forward from my current position after turning left. Wait, no, the observation after turning left says the door is 2 left and 3 forward. So my current direction after turning left would have forward pointing in the new direction. So if the door is 3 steps forward from there, I need to move forward three times. But before that, perhaps I need to adjust my left direction to align with the door's position. 

Wait, maybe the key here is that the door is locked, so I need to use the yellow key on it. The key is in my inventory, so I need to approach the door and then toggle it. But to get there, I have to navigate to the door's position. 

Given that the door is 2 steps left and 3 steps forward from my current position, I need to determine the optimal path. Let's consider my current facing direction. If after turning left, my forward direction is now what was my previous left, then moving forward 3 steps would take me towards the door's forward direction. Then, moving left 2 steps would get me to the door. But how do I move left? 

Alternatively, maybe I should turn around. If I turn left twice (180 degrees), then my forward direction is opposite to where I was before. Then, moving forward might not help. 

Alternatively, maybe I need to first move left twice to face the direction where the door is. Wait, the door is 2 steps left and 3 steps forward. So if I turn left once, my forward direction is now left from my original position. Then moving forward 3 steps would get me 3 steps in that new forward direction (which was original left). Then, from there, moving left 2 steps would get me to the door. 

But how do I move left? Because the allowed actions are turn left, turn right, go forward, etc. So to move left from my current facing direction, I might need to turn left again. 

Wait, let's think step by step. 

Current state: carrying yellow key. Observations show a locked yellow door at 2 steps left and 3 steps forward. 

Assuming I'm currently facing a direction where my forward is, say, north. After turning left, I'm now facing west. The door is 2 steps left (from my current position) and 3 steps forward. If I'm facing west, then left would be south. So moving left (turning left again) from west would face me south. Then moving forward 2 steps would take me 2 steps south. But the door is 2 steps left and 3 forward. 

Alternatively, maybe I need to first move forward 3 steps (while facing west) to reach the point where the door's forward direction is. Then, from there, move left 2 steps. But moving left would require turning left again. 

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to turn left to face the correct direction, then move forward 3 steps towards the door, and then toggle it. But wait, the door's position is 2 steps left and 3 forward. If after turning left, moving forward 3 would put me 3 steps west (assuming original north), and then the door is 2 steps left (south) from there. But how do I get to the door's exact position? 

Alternatively, maybe the door is in the direction that requires me to first move left twice and then forward. But I need to check the allowed actions. The possible actions are turn left, turn right, go forward, pick up, drop, toggle. 

So, the steps could be:

1. Turn left to face the direction where the door is 3 steps forward.
2. Go forward 3 times to reach the door's forward position.
3. Then, turn left again to face the door's left direction (which is now my left after turning left twice?), but this might not be necessary.
4. Toggle the door to open it.

Wait, but the door's position is 2 steps left and 3 steps forward. So if after turning left, my forward is now the direction towards the door's forward. Then moving forward 3 steps would get me to the door's forward position, which is 2 steps left from there. So once I'm at that position, I need to move left 2 steps. But how? Because the allowed actions don't include moving left directly; I have to turn left or right and then go forward. 

Alternatively, maybe after moving forward 3 steps, I need to turn left (now facing the direction where the door is 2 steps left) and then go forward 2 steps. That would get me to the door. Then, toggle it. 

So the sequence would be:

- Turn left (to face west, assuming original north)
- Go forward 3 (now 3 steps west)
- Turn left again (now facing south)
- Go forward 2 (now 2 steps south, reaching the door)
- Toggle door

But the problem is that after the first turn left and moving forward 3, the observation might change. However, the current observation after the last action (toggle) showed that the door is still there, implying that the key was correct but perhaps the position wasn't right. 

Alternatively, maybe the door is directly in front after adjusting direction. Let me check the previous observations. 

In the previous step, after turning left, the door was 2 steps left and 3 steps forward. So if I turn left again, my forward direction is now south, and left would be east. Then moving forward 3 steps would take me 3 steps south, which might not align with the door's position. 

Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Maybe a better approach is to first navigate to the door's location using the allowed actions. Since the door is 2 left and 3 forward, perhaps I need to turn left twice to face the direction of the door's position and then move forward. But I'm not sure. 

Another angle: since the key is yellow and the door is locked and yellow, using the toggle action on the door while facing it should open it. So the critical step is to face the door and then toggle. 

So the problem is how to face the door. The door is 2 steps left and 3 steps forward from my current position. Let's assume my current facing direction is north. Then, left is west. The door is 2 steps west (left) and 3 steps north (forward). Wait, no: if the door is 2 steps left and 3 steps forward from my current position, and I'm facing north, then left is west, so the door is 2 steps west and 3 steps north. So from my current position, to reach the door, I need to go west 2 and north 3. But how to do that with the allowed actions? 

Each go forward moves one step in the current facing direction. Each turn left or right changes the facing direction. 

So, possible steps:

1. Turn left (now facing west)
2. Go forward 3 (now 3 steps west, which covers the 3 steps forward part of the door's position)
3. Turn left again (now facing south)
4. Go forward 2 (now 2 steps south, which covers the 2 steps left part)

But then, after these steps, I would be at the door's location. Then, toggle the door. 

Alternatively, maybe after turning left once and moving forward 3, I'm 3 steps west, and the door is 2 steps west (left) and 3 steps north (forward). Wait, that doesn't align. Maybe my initial assumption about directions is off. 

Alternatively, perhaps the door's position is relative to my current position and facing. If the door is 2 steps left and 3 steps forward, that means if I'm facing north, left is west, so the door is 2 steps west and 3 steps north. But to get there, I need to go west 2 and north 3. But with the actions allowed, I can only move forward (which is north in this case) and turn. 

So perhaps:

1. Turn left (west)
2. Go forward 2 (now 2 steps west)
3. Turn around (turn left twice) to face east
4. Go forward 3 (now 3 steps east, which would be back to the original position plus 2 west and 3 east, ending up 1 east, which isn't helpful)
Hmm, this isn't working. 

Maybe a different approach. Since the door is 2 steps left and 3 steps forward, perhaps I need to first move left twice and then forward three times. But how to move left? 

Each time I turn left, my forward direction changes. So:

- Start facing north
- Turn left (west)
- Go forward 2 (now 2 steps west)
- Turn left again (south)
- Go forward 3 (now 3 steps south)
But this would end me up 2 west and 3 south from the original position, which doesn't match the door's position of 2 left and 3 forward. 

Alternatively, maybe I need to face a different initial direction. 

This is getting complicated. Let's try to think in terms of the immediate observation. The door is 2 steps left and 3 steps forward. I have the yellow key. The goal is to toggle the door. 

So the key here is to face the door and then toggle. The problem is navigating to the door's position. 

If I can face the door, then toggling it should open. So how to face the door. 

Assuming I'm facing north, the door is 2 west and 3 north. To face it, I need to turn left (west) and then north is my left? No, if I'm facing west, north would be my left. So to face the door's position (which is 2 west and 3 north from me), I need to face northwest? Wait, no. Because the door's position is 2 steps to my left (west) and 3 steps forward (north). So the door is in the northwest direction from my current position. 

Wait, if I'm facing north, left is west. So the door is 2 steps west and 3 steps north. That would place it diagonally northwest. But how to move there using only forward and turning. 

Alternatively, perhaps I need to first move forward 3 steps (north), then left 2 steps (west). But moving left isn't an action; I have to turn left and then go forward. 

So:

1. Go forward 3 (north)
2. Turn left (west)
3. Go forward 2 (west)

This way, I end up 3 steps north and 2 steps west from the original position, which matches the door's position. Then, toggle the door. 

Yes, this makes sense. So the actions would be:

go forward three times, then turn left and go forward twice, then toggle. 

But in the current observation, after the previous toggle, the door is still there, implying that the agent wasn't facing it correctly. 

In the latest observation, the door is 2 steps left and 3 steps forward. So the agent is not yet in the correct position. Therefore, the next step should be to move closer to the door. 

Since the door is 3 steps forward and 2 steps left, the agent needs to adjust their position. 

Assuming the agent is currently facing a direction where forward is not towards the door. For example, if after turning left, the agent's forward is now west, and the door is 3 steps forward (west) and 2 steps left (south). So to reach the door, the agent needs to go west 3 and south 2. 

But how? The agent can't move south directly; they have to turn and go forward. 

So:

1. Turn left (now facing west)
2. Go forward 3 (now at the door's forward position)
3. Turn left again (now facing south)
4. Go forward 2 (now at the door's location)
5. Toggle

But in the current observation, the door is 2 steps left and 3 forward. So after turning left once and moving forward 3, the door would be 2 steps left (south) from that new position. Then turning left again (south) and moving forward 2 reaches the door. 

Therefore, the correct actions would be:

turn left, go forward 3, turn left, go forward 2, toggle. 

But in the current step, the observation is:

You carry a yellow key
a wall 3 steps forward
a wall 3 steps right
a locked yellow door 2 steps left and 3 steps forward

So the agent is facing a direction where forward is blocked by a wall (3 steps forward). The door is 2 left and 3 forward. 

Wait, maybe the agent is facing north, and there's a wall 3 steps forward (north). The door is 2 steps left (west) and 3 steps forward (north). So the door is in the same direction as the wall but 2 steps to the left. 

But if there's a wall 3 steps forward, the agent can't move forward past that. So how is the door 3 steps forward? That suggests that the door is behind the wall? That doesn't make sense. 

Wait, maybe the wall is in the way, so the agent can't go straight forward past the wall. Therefore, the door must be in a different direction. 

This is confusing. Let me re-examine the observations. 

The latest observation before the current one was:

Observation:
You carry a yellow key
a wall 3 steps forward
a wall 3 steps right
a locked yellow door 2 steps left and 3 steps forward

So the agent is facing a direction where forward is blocked by a wall (3 steps away). The door is 2 steps to the left and 3 steps forward. 

But if forward is blocked by a wall, how can the door be 3 steps forward? That would mean the door is behind the wall, which isn't possible in a typical grid world. 

This suggests that the agent's current facing direction has a wall 3 steps forward, but the door is in a different relative position. Perhaps the agent is facing east, with a wall 3 steps east. The door is 2 steps north (left) and 3 steps east (forward). But then the door would be behind the wall, which isn't possible. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent turned left earlier, so their forward direction is now west, and there's a wall 3 steps west. The door is 2 steps left (south) and 3 steps forward (west). But then the door is 3 steps west (behind the wall), which again doesn't make sense. 

Perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the relative directions. The problem might be that the wall and the door are in different relative positions based on the agent's current facing. 

Given that the agent previously tried to toggle the door but failed, because they weren't in the correct position. So now, the agent needs to adjust their position to face the door. 

Assuming the agent is facing north, with a wall 3 steps north (forward), and the door is 2 steps west (left) and 3 steps north (forward). But if there's a wall 3 steps north, the door can't be 3 steps north. 

This suggests that the initial interpretation of directions might be incorrect. Maybe the agent is facing a different direction. 

Alternatively, perhaps the wall is 3 steps to the right, and the door is 2 steps left and 3 steps forward. If the agent is facing north, right is east. The wall is 3 steps east. The door is 2 steps west (left) and 3 steps north (forward). So the door is in the northwest direction, 2 steps west and 3 steps north. 

But how to get there. The agent can't move north past the wall 3 steps east. Wait, no, the wall is to the right (east), so the agent can move north, west, or south. 

So possible actions:

1. Turn left (west)
2. Go forward 2 (to reach the door's left position)
3. Turn north (but how? Turn left again to face south, then right to face north)
   - Turn left (south)
   - Turn right (west again? No)
   This is getting messy. 

Alternatively:

- Turn left (west)
- Go forward 2 (now 2 steps west)
- Turn around (left twice) to face east
- Go forward 3 (now 3 steps east, which would be back to original position plus 2 west and 3 east, ending up 1 east, not helpful)
Hmm, not working. 

Another approach: Since the door is 2 steps left and 3 steps forward, and the agent is carrying the key, perhaps the agent needs to first move left twice and","

Your previous output did not contain a valid action. Defaulted to action: go forward

Observation:
You carry a yellow key
a wall 2 steps forward
a wall 3 steps right
a locked yellow door 2 steps left and 2 steps forward",0,False
9,turn left,"<reasoning>
Let me try to figure out what action to take here. The current observation says I'm carrying a yellow key. There's a wall 2 steps forward and another wall 3 steps to the right. The key point is the locked yellow door located 2 steps left and 2 steps forward from me.

Since I have the yellow key, the door must be the one I need to open. The door is to the left and forward. But my current position isn't precise. I need to adjust my direction to be facing the door. From the previous steps, I might have turned left once before, but maybe I need to turn again to face the correct direction. Alternatively, I could be facing forward and need to turn left to face the door's position.

Wait, the door is 2 steps left and 2 steps forward. If I'm currently facing a direction where left is towards the door's location, then turning left would align me correctly. Once aligned, I can toggle the door to open it. But I should first ensure I'm facing the door. Let me check the previous actions. The last few actions were moving forward towards the key, picking it up, toggling (which probably didn't work because I wasn't in front of the door yet), turning left, and then moving forward again. Now the door is 2 left and 2 forward. If I turned left once, maybe I need to turn left again to face the exact direction of the door. Or perhaps I need to move forward a bit more to get into position. But moving forward again might take me away from the door's location. Alternatively, since the door is to the left and forward, maybe I need to turn left once more, then move forward twice? Wait, but moving forward would take me towards the door's forward direction, which is already 2 steps. Hmm. 

Alternatively, maybe I should first turn left to face the direction where the door is located relative to my current position. If the door is 2 steps left and 2 steps forward, and I'm currently facing a direction where left is maybe northeast, then turning left would face me northeast, and moving forward twice would get me to the door. But I need to make sure I'm facing the right way. 

Alternatively, after picking up the key, the previous action was toggling, which didn't work because I wasn't in front of the door. Then turning left, which might have changed my direction. Now, with the door 2 left and 2 forward, I need to adjust my direction to face that position. Let me think: if I'm facing north, and the door is 2 left (west) and 2 forward (north), then the door is northwest. To face northwest, I would need to turn left from north, which would make me face west, then turn north? Wait, maybe my current facing direction isn't clear. The observations don't specify which direction I'm facing, which complicates things. 

Assuming that after previous turns, my current direction might be left, but without explicit info, it's tricky. However, the key is that I have the yellow key, and the door is locked and requires it. The correct action here should be to toggle the door once I'm in front of it. So the steps would be: move to the door's location, then toggle. But how to get there. 

Wait, the door is 2 steps left and 2 steps forward. So from my current position, if I turn left, that would face me towards the left direction, which is where the door is partially located (2 left). Then moving forward twice would get me to the door's position. Alternatively, if I turn around (180 degrees), but that might not be necessary. 

But maybe I need to first turn left to face the direction where the door's left and forward are. Let's think: if I'm facing east, turning left would make me face north. Then moving forward twice would take me 2 steps north, and since the door is 2 left (west) and 2 forward (north), that would place the door at northwest, which is not directly in front. This is getting confusing. 

Alternatively, perhaps the door's position is relative to my current direction. If I'm facing north, then left is west. The door is 2 steps west and 2 steps north. So from my current position, to reach the door, I need to go west 2 steps and north 2 steps. But since I can only move forward or turn, I need to adjust my direction. 

If I turn left (west), then move forward twice, that would get me west 2 steps. Then turn north (which would be another left turn?), but I can't turn north directly; I have to turn left again. Wait, no. Each turn left changes my facing direction 90 degrees counterclockwise. So starting facing north, turn left to face west, move forward twice (now at west 2, north 0). Then turn left again to face south, but that's not helpful. Hmm. Maybe I need a different approach. 

Alternatively, if the door is 2 steps left and 2 steps forward, maybe I need to first move forward twice to get the forward distance, then turn left twice to face the left direction. But that might not be right. 

This is getting too complicated without knowing the initial direction. However, the key point is that I have the yellow key, and the door is locked and requires it. The correct action once in front of the door is to toggle it. So the plan is: navigate to the door's location, then toggle. 

Given the current observation, the door is 2 steps left and 2 steps forward. So from my current position, I need to adjust my direction to face the door. If I turn left once, maybe that aligns me to face the direction where the door is 2 steps ahead. Then move forward twice to reach the door. But after moving forward twice, I should be in front of the door to toggle it. 

Alternatively, after turning left, moving forward once would make the door 1 step left and 1 step forward. Then another left turn and move forward? Not sure. 

Alternatively, maybe the best action now is to toggle the door, but only if I'm in front of it. However, the observation says the door is 2 steps left and 2 steps forward, so I'm not yet in front of it. Therefore, toggling now wouldn't work. 

So the correct action should be to adjust my position. Since the door is 2 left and 2 forward, I need to either turn left and move forward twice, or turn another direction. 

Wait, if I turn left, that would face me towards the left direction (assuming initial direction was north). Then moving forward two steps would take me to the door's position (2 left and 2 forward). Then I can toggle. 

So the steps would be: turn left, go forward, go forward, toggle. 

But in the current observation, after the previous actions, the door is 2 left and 2 forward. So the next action should be to turn left to face the correct direction, then move forward twice. However, in the current observation, the user has already tried toggling earlier when not in front, which failed. 

So the immediate next action should be to turn left, aligning towards the door's direction, then move forward. 

But according to the latest observation, after moving forward a couple of times, the door is now 2 left and 2 forward. So if I turn left, then move forward twice, I should reach the door. 

But the action to take now is the first step: turn left to face the direction where the door is located relative to my current position. Then the next actions would be moving forward twice. 

Given that the previous action was toggling (which failed), and now the door is 2 left and 2 forward, the best action is to turn left to face the correct direction, then move forward. 

So the chosen action should be turn left, which would align me to face the direction where moving forward twice gets me to the door.

 <sep> human:","You carry a yellow key

a locked yellow door 2 steps right and 2 steps forward",0,False
10,go forward,"<reasoning>
The current observation is that I'm carrying a yellow key. The walls are 4 steps forward and 2 steps right. There's a locked yellow door located 2 steps right and 2 steps forward.

Hmm, since the door is locked and I have the matching yellow key, I need to get to the door to toggle it open. The problem is figuring out the direction to move. The door's position is 2 steps right and 2 steps forward from my current location.

Earlier, the user had me turn left, but now the door is to the right and forward. Let me check the previous steps. In the last few observations, the door was moving closer each time I moved forward. But now the door is 2 steps to the right and 2 steps forward. 

I need to figure out my current orientation. Let's assume that after turning left previously, my facing direction changed. If the door is 2 steps right and 2 steps forward, perhaps I need to adjust my direction so that moving forward will align me with the door. 

If I'm currently facing north, then turning right would make me face east. If the door is 2 steps east and 2 steps north, then moving forward twice would get me there. Wait, but the door is 2 steps right and 2 steps forward. If right is east, and forward is north, then the door is northeast. So to face northeast, I might need to turn right (east) and then north? Or maybe adjust my orientation first. 

Alternatively, if I'm facing east, then moving forward would take me east, but the door is east and north. Maybe I need to turn north first. But the available actions are turn left, turn right, go forward, etc. 

Wait, my current facing direction isn't specified in the observation. That's a problem. Without knowing which direction I'm facing, it's hard to plan the path. But maybe based on previous actions, like turning left, I can infer the direction. 

In previous steps, after turning left, then moving forward a few times, the door's position changed. Now, the door is 2 steps right and 2 steps forward. If each time I moved forward, the door's distance decreased, perhaps my current orientation is such that moving forward reduces the distance in the forward direction but the right direction remains. 

Alternatively, maybe I should face the direction where the door is located. Since the door is to the right and forward, perhaps turning right would align me towards the door's direction. Then moving forward would get me closer. 

Wait, but the door's position is 2 steps right and 2 steps forward. If I turn right, my forward direction would be east (assuming original was north), and right would be south. Wait, no. Directions can be confusing. Let me think again. 

If I'm facing north, turning right would make me face east. Then moving forward would take me east. The door is 2 east and 2 north. So from that position, moving north (which would be turning left again) would get me to the door. But I don't know my current orientation. 

Alternatively, maybe the door is in front of me after turning left and moving forward. But in the current observation, the door is 2 right and 2 forward. So perhaps I need to first turn right to face the direction where the door is relative to my current position. 

Alternatively, if I'm facing east, then moving forward would take me east, but the door is east and north. So I would need to turn north (another right turn) to face northeast, then move forward. But how do I know which direction I'm facing? 

This is a bit tricky. Maybe the best approach is to use the toggle action as soon as I'm in front of the door. But to get there, I need to navigate using the available actions. 

Since the door is 2 steps right and 2 steps forward, perhaps I should first turn right to face the direction where the door is. Then move forward twice. But if moving forward once gets me 1 step closer forward, and turning right aligns me to move towards the right direction. 

Wait, each move forward is one step. So if the door is 2 steps right and 2 steps forward, I need to adjust my direction so that moving forward twice and right once would reach the door. But the available actions are turn left/right and go forward. 

Alternatively, perhaps I need to turn right, then move forward once to reduce the right distance, then turn north (another right turn) and move forward twice. But without knowing the current facing direction, it's hard. 

Alternatively, since the door is to the right and forward, maybe I need to first turn right to face the direction of the door's right (which would be south if I was facing north), but that doesn't make sense. 

Wait, maybe I need to turn left twice to face west, then move forward, but that might not align. 

Alternatively, perhaps the best action is to move forward again, in the hope that it gets me closer to the door's forward direction. But in previous steps, moving forward reduced the forward distance. For example, the door was 4 steps forward, then 3, then 2, etc. Now it's 2 steps forward and 2 steps right. So moving forward again would reduce the forward distance to 1, but the right distance remains 2. Then I might need to turn right and move forward. 

But how to determine the direction to turn. Since the door is to the right and forward, after moving forward once, the door would be 1 step forward and 2 steps right. Then turning right would face me towards the right direction, and moving forward twice would reach the door. 

So the sequence would be: go forward (door now 1 forward, 2 right), turn right, go forward twice. Then toggle. 

But in the current observation, after moving forward, the door is 2 steps right and 2 steps forward. So perhaps the correct action now is to turn right, then move forward until aligned. 

But given that the available actions are turn left, turn right, go forward, etc., I need to choose between those. 

Alternatively, maybe I should first turn right to face the direction where the right steps are, then move forward. But since the door is also 2 steps forward, perhaps after turning right, moving forward twice would get me there. 

Wait, if I turn right, my forward direction is now east (assuming original was north). The door is 2 east and 2 north. So turning right makes me face east. Moving forward once would put me 1 east, door is 2 east. Then I need to move forward again, but also account for the north direction. 

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe the best action is to go forward again, as moving towards the door's forward direction. Since previously moving forward reduced the forward distance, perhaps doing so again will get me closer. Then, after that, turn right to face the right direction and move forward. 

Alternatively, if the door is 2 steps right and 2 steps forward, perhaps turning right and moving forward twice would reach the door. 

But without knowing the current orientation, it's a bit of a guess. 

Another approach: since the door is locked and requires the yellow key, and I have the key, the next step is to reach the door and toggle it. The door's position is 2 right and 2 forward. So to get there, I need to move in a direction that covers both right and forward. 

If I turn right, then moving forward twice would cover the 2 steps forward and 2 steps right? No, because each forward move is in the current facing direction. If I turn right, my forward is now east, so moving forward twice would take me 2 east, but the door is 2 east and 2 north. So that would get me to the east position but not north. 

Alternatively, if I turn left, then my forward direction is west. That's not helpful. 

Wait, perhaps I need to first turn right, move forward once (now 1 east, 2 north), then turn north (another right turn), move forward once. But how to turn north? Each turn is 90 degrees. 

Alternatively, after turning right, move forward twice, then turn left, and move forward once. 

This is getting too convoluted. Maybe the best action here is to move forward, as it's the only way to reduce the forward distance, which is part of the door's position. Since the door is 2 steps forward and right, moving forward once would make it 1 step forward and right. Then, turning right and moving forward once would align me with the door. 

But the current observation says the door is 2 steps right and 2 steps forward. So moving forward once would make it 1 step forward and 2 right. Then, turn right (now facing east), and move forward twice. That would get me to the door's position. 

So the sequence would be: go forward, turn right, go forward twice, then toggle. 

But in the current step, the observation is that after previous actions, the door is 2 steps right and 2 steps forward. So the immediate action should be to move forward to reduce the forward distance. Then adjust direction. 

But the user's previous actions had me moving forward multiple times, and then turning left when the door was 2 steps left and forward. Now the door is to the right. 

Alternatively, perhaps I should turn right first to face the direction of the door's right (which would be south if originally facing north), but that's not helpful. 

Wait, maybe the correct approach is to turn right, then move forward twice. Because if I turn right, my forward direction is east, and moving forward twice would cover the 2 steps right and 2 steps forward? No, because moving east twice would cover 2 steps east, but the door is 2 east and 2 north. 

This is confusing. Maybe I need to consider that the door's position is relative to my current orientation. If I'm facing north, and the door is 2 east and 2 north, then to reach it, I need to move northeast. But I can only move in straight lines by turning left or right and then moving forward. 

So to face northeast, I would need to turn right (east) and then north (another right turn). But each turn is 90 degrees. So turning right twice would face me southeast. Wait, no. If I'm facing north, turn right once to face east, turn right again to face south. That's not helpful. 

Alternatively, turn left twice to face west, which isn't right. 

Hmm, perhaps the problem is that without knowing the initial direction, it's hard to determine the optimal path. But given that the game allows toggling the door once I'm in front of it, maybe the key is to move in such a way that the door comes into the forward direction. 

Since the door is 2 steps right and 2 steps forward, perhaps I should first turn right, then move forward twice. That would take me 2 steps east (right) and 2 steps forward (east?), but the door is east and north. 

Wait, maybe I need to turn left instead. If I turn left, facing west, then moving forward would decrease the right distance. But the door is to the right, so moving west isn't helpful. 

Alternatively, turn left twice to face south. Then moving forward would take me south, which isn't towards the door. 

This is a bit of a puzzle. Maybe the best action here is to move forward again, as it reduces the forward distance, and then adjust direction. 

Alternatively, since the door is 2 steps right and 2 steps forward, perhaps I need to turn right and move forward once, then turn north (another right turn) and move forward once. But how to execute that. 

Wait, the available actions are turn left, turn right, go forward. So each turn changes direction by 90 degrees. 

If I'm currently facing north, and the door is 2 east and 2 north, then turning right (east), moving forward once (1 east), then turning north (another right turn, now facing south?), which is not correct. 

Alternatively, if I turn right, face east, move forward twice (2 east), but the door is 2 east and 2 north. So that would leave me 2 north of the door. 

No, that doesn't work. 

Alternatively, if I turn left (west), move forward, but that moves away from the door's north direction. 

I think I'm stuck. Maybe the correct action is to move forward, as it's the only way to reduce the forward distance, and then turn right to face the door's right direction. 

So in the current observation, the door is 2 steps right and 2 steps forward. Moving forward once would make it 1 step forward and 2 right. Then turn right (now facing east), move forward once, which would get me to the door's position (1 forward + 1 east = total 2 forward and 2 east, which matches the door's position). Then toggle. 

So the steps would be: go forward, turn right, go forward, toggle. 

But in the current step, the observation is that the door is 2 right and 2 forward. So the immediate action should be to go forward to reduce the forward distance. 

Therefore, the answer should be go forward.

11,toggle,"<reasoning>
Let's see. The goal is to open the door. The agent has a yellow key already. The current observation mentions a locked yellow door that's 2 steps to the right and 1 step forward.

So, the key matches the door's color, which is good. But the door is locked, and the key is in the agent's inventory. To unlock the door, the agent needs to be in front of it. Right now, the door is 2 steps right and 1 step forward. The agent's current position isn't specified precisely, but based on previous steps, they might need to adjust their direction to face the door.

Looking at the surroundings: walls are 3 steps forward and 2 steps right. The door's position is to the right and forward. So the agent should probably turn right to face the door's direction. Once facing the door, using the 'toggle' action would interact with it, which should unlock it since the key is present.

But wait, the agent already has the key. So after toggling the door, it should open. The previous steps involved moving forward and turning left/right to navigate. The last action was 'go forward', and the observation now shows the door is closer (1 step forward). 

So the next step is to face the door. The door is 2 steps right and 1 step forward. The agent is currently facing a direction where moving forward gets closer to the door, but the door's position is diagonally. Wait, maybe the agent needs to turn right to face the door's direction. Let me visualize: if the agent is facing north, and the door is 2 steps east and 1 step north, then turning right (east) would face the door's direction. But the door is locked, so the agent needs to be directly in front. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent is facing a direction where they need to adjust their heading. The previous action was 'go forward', which brought the door to 1 step forward. But the door is also 2 steps to the right. So perhaps the agent is currently facing north, and the door is to the northeast. To face the door, they need to turn right (east) first, then move forward. But since the door is only 1 step forward now, maybe they can toggle it directly if they are facing it. 

Wait, the current observation says the door is 2 steps right and 1 step forward. If the agent is facing north, then turning right (east) would make the door 2 steps to the right (east) and 1 step forward (north). So to be in front of the door, the agent needs to face east and then move north? Or is the door's position relative based on the agent's current facing? 

This part is a bit unclear. The game's coordinate system might be relative to the agent's facing direction. So if the agent is facing north, then ""forward"" is north, ""right"" is east, etc. In the current observation, the door is 2 steps right (east) and 1 step forward (north). So the agent is currently facing a direction where moving forward takes them north, and to the right (east) is where the door is. 

To interact with the door, the agent needs to be directly in front of it. So if the door is 1 step forward and 2 steps right, the agent might need to turn right (east) first, then move forward once to be in front of the door. But according to the observation, the door is 2 steps right and 1 step forward. So after turning right, the agent would have the door 2 steps to the right (east) and 1 step forward (north from their new facing direction). Wait, no—if the agent turns right (east), their forward direction is now east. Then the door's position would be 2 steps north (original forward) and 1 step east (original right). Hmm, this is getting confusing. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to adjust their direction so that they are facing the door. Since the door is 2 steps to the right and 1 step forward, perhaps the agent should turn right twice (south?) to face the opposite direction. Wait, no. Let's think step by step. 

The agent's current facing direction isn't specified, but based on previous actions: the user had the agent turn left, go forward multiple times, pick up the key, then toggle (which probably didn't work because the door was locked), then turned left again. 

In the last few observations, after toggling, the door's position changed to being closer. Now, the door is 2 steps right and 1 step forward. So maybe the agent is facing north, and the door is northeast. To face the door, they need to turn east (right) once. Then, moving forward once would put them in front of the door. But according to the observation, after turning right, the door would be 2 steps north and 1 step east. So if the agent turns right (east), then their forward direction is east. The door is 1 step forward (east) and 2 steps north (which would be the new right direction). That doesn't line up. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent should turn around. If they turned left twice (180 degrees), facing south, then the door's position would be 2 steps left (south) and 1 step backward. That doesn't help. 

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to first turn right to face east, then move forward once to be 1 step east (which would be the door's position as 2 steps right and 1 forward from the original position). No, that's not matching. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to move closer. The door is 1 step forward and 2 steps right. If the agent turns right (east), then moves forward, that would bring them to a position where the door is 1 step north and 2 steps east. But toggling wouldn't work if they're not directly in front. 

This is tricky. The key point is that the door is locked and requires the yellow key. Since the agent has the key, they just need to be in front of the door and toggle it. The problem is navigating to the correct position. 

The current observation says the door is 2 steps right and 1 step forward. So the agent is likely facing a direction where forward is away from the door. To be in front of the door, the agent needs to face it. If the door is 2 steps to the right and 1 forward, maybe the agent should turn right (east) to face the door's direction, then move forward once. But after turning right, the door's position would be 2 steps north (original forward) and 1 step east (original right). So from the new facing direction (east), the door is 1 step north and 2 steps forward (east). That doesn't line up. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent should turn around 180 degrees (left twice) to face south, then move forward and left? This is getting too complicated. 

Perhaps the simplest solution is to keep moving forward until the door is directly in front. But in the current observation, the door is 1 step forward and 2 steps right. Moving forward would reduce the forward distance to 0, but the right distance remains 2. So the agent would be next to the door but not directly in front. Toggling then might not work. 

Wait, maybe the game considers that if you're adjacent to the door (even diagonally), you can toggle it. But the tips say to interact with the object in front. So the agent needs to be directly facing the door. 

Given that the agent has the key, the correct action is to toggle the door when facing it. Therefore, the agent needs to adjust their direction to face the door. Since the door is 2 steps right and 1 step forward, the agent should turn right (east) once, making the door 1 step forward and 2 steps north. Then moving forward once would place them in front of the door (1 step north), and toggling would unlock it. 

But according to the current observation, after turning right, the door's position would be 1 step forward (east) and 2 steps north (which would be the new right direction). So to face the door, the agent needs to turn right, then perhaps turn right again to face north? That doesn't make sense. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent should turn left instead. If the agent is facing north, turning left (west) would make the door 2 steps east (which is west from the new facing) and 1 step forward (south). That doesn't help. 

This is confusing. Maybe the best bet is to turn right and then move forward, even if the door isn't directly in front. The game might allow toggling when adjacent. Alternatively, the agent might need to adjust their position more carefully. 

But given the previous actions and the observation, the most logical next step is to turn right to face the door's direction, then move forward. If that doesn't work, then perhaps move forward again. However, the observation mentions the door is 1 step forward and 2 steps right after the last move. So moving forward once would bring the door to 0 steps forward and 2 steps right. Then toggling might not work. 

Wait, but the agent has the key, so as long as they are in front of the door, toggling should unlock it. Maybe the agent needs to be directly in front, even if there's a wall nearby. But the walls are 3 steps forward and 2 steps right. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent should first turn right to face east, then move forward twice to reduce the right distance. But the walls are 2 steps right now. 

I think the correct action here is to turn right to face the door's direction, then move forward once to be in front of it, then toggle. But based on the current observation, after turning right, the door is 1 step forward and 2 steps north (from the new facing). So moving forward once would place the agent 1 step north of the door, which might not be directly in front. 

This is getting too tangled. Given the previous steps, the agent has the key and the door is getting closer. The most logical next action is to toggle the door, assuming they are facing it. But in the current observation, the door is 2 steps right and 1 step forward. If the agent is facing north, they need to turn right (east) to face the door's direction. Then, moving forward once would place them 1 step east (door's position is 2 steps right and 1 forward from original position). Wait, no. If the agent turns right (east), their forward direction is east. The door is 2 steps east (right) and 1 step north (forward) from their original position. So after turning right, the door is 1 step north (original forward) and 2 steps east (original right). From the new facing (east), the door is 1 step north and 2 steps forward. That means the agent needs to move forward twice to reach the door's position, but there's a wall 2 steps forward (from current observation). 

This suggests that the agent cannot move forward past the wall. Therefore, the door must be behind the wall, which doesn't make sense. 

Wait, the current observation says a wall is 2 steps forward and 3 steps right. So if the agent turns right (east), the wall is 3 steps right (which would be north from the new facing) and 2 steps forward (east). So the agent can't move past the wall. Therefore, the door must be in a position that's reachable. 

Given all this, perhaps the correct action is to toggle the door even if not directly in front, but that's unlikely. The most plausible action is to turn right to face the door's direction and then move forward if possible. But given the walls, maybe the agent is blocked and needs to adjust differently. 

Alternatively, since the door is 1 step forward and 2 steps right, and the agent has the key, the correct action is to toggle the door while facing it. So the agent needs to turn right to face east, then toggle. But according to the observation, after turning right, the door is 1 step forward (east) and 2 steps north (original right). So toggling while facing east would interact with the object in front (1 step east), which is the door. Therefore, the correct action is to turn right and then toggle. 

But the agent needs to be in the correct orientation. So the sequence would be: turn right, then toggle. 

In the current observation, the agent is facing a direction where the door is 2 steps right and 1 step forward. Turning right would make the door 1 step forward (east) and 2 steps north (original right). Toggling then would interact with the object 1 step forward (the door), which is locked but has the key. Therefore, toggling should unlock it. 

So the correct action is to toggle, but only if the agent is facing the door. Since the previous action was 'go forward' and the door is now 1 step forward, perhaps the agent is facing the direction where the door is now 1 step ahead. Wait, no. The previous observation had the door 2 steps right and 1 step forward. After moving forward, the door is now 1 step forward and 2 steps right. So if the agent turned right, their forward direction is east, and the door is 1 step east (forward) and 2 steps north. Therefore, toggling while facing east would target the object 1 step east, which is the door. 

Yes, that makes sense. So the agent should turn right to face east, then toggle the door in front (1 step east). Since they have the key, toggling should unlock and open it. 

Therefore, the correct action is 'toggle'.

12,toggle,"<reasoning>
Let's see. The current observation is that I'm carrying a yellow key. There's a wall 3 steps forward and 2 steps to the right. The locked yellow door is 2 steps to the right and 1 step forward. So I need to open the door with the key.

First, I should check where I am relative to the door. The door is to the right and one step forward. If I look at my current direction, if I'm facing north, then moving right would be east. But maybe my current orientation isn't known. Wait, the previous actions might have changed my direction.

Looking back at the history, in the previous steps, the assistant turned left, then went forward multiple times, picked up the key, tried to toggle the door but failed perhaps because direction was wrong. Then, after some adjustments, the door's position was 2 steps right and 1 forward. Last action was toggling, which didn't work. Now, the door is still there, locked, and I have the key.

So to toggle the door, I need to be facing it directly. The door is 2 steps right and 1 forward. If I'm facing north, then to reach the door, I need to turn right (east) to face east, then go forward one step, but the door is 2 steps right (east) and 1 forward (north). Wait, maybe my current direction is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the door's position is relative to my current facing. If the door is 2 steps to the right and 1 forward, that might mean that if I'm facing north, moving right would be east, so the door is east two steps and north one step from my current position. But I might need to adjust my direction to face the door properly.

The key is yellow, and the door is locked yellow, so the key should fit. But to toggle the door, I have to be in front of it. Maybe I need to move closer. Let's see: the door is 2 steps right and 1 forward. If I'm currently facing north, right is east. To get to the door, I could turn right (east), then move forward one step to be in front of the door? Wait, but the door is 2 steps right (east) and 1 forward (north). So from my current position, if I turn right (east), then go forward two steps, but the observation says the door is 2 steps right and 1 forward. Wait, maybe the coordinates are relative. Let's parse the door's position again: ""2 steps right and 1 step forward"". That probably means that from my current position, the door is located 2 steps to my right and 1 step forward in that direction. So if I'm facing north, right is east, so the door is two steps east and one step north from me. To reach the door, I need to face east, move two steps, then face north and move one step. But that might not be necessary. Alternatively, maybe the door is in my forward path after turning right. Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe the door is directly in front of me after turning right. For example, if I'm facing north, turn right (east), then the door is one step forward (east) and two steps right (which would be north two steps from there). Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. The key point is that I need to be facing the door to toggle it. Since the door is locked and I have the key, the correct action is to toggle it once I'm in front of it.

Looking at the previous steps, the assistant tried to toggle the door but failed. Perhaps the direction was wrong. So maybe I need to adjust my facing first. Let's check the current observation again: the door is 2 steps right and 1 step forward. Suppose I'm currently facing north. Then, ""right"" would be east, and ""forward"" would be north. So the door is two steps east and one step north from my current position. To get to the door, I would need to turn right (east), then move two steps forward, but that would place me two steps east. Then, from there, moving north one step would get me to the door. But toggling the door requires being in front of it. Alternatively, maybe the door is in front of me after turning right. Wait, if I turn right (east), then the forward direction is east. The door is two steps right (east) and one step forward (east). So if I turn right, the door is one step forward. So after turning right, moving one step forward would place me directly in front of the door. Then, toggling it would work. So the steps needed are: turn right, go forward once, then toggle.

But in the current observation, after the last action (toggle), the door's position hasn't changed. So perhaps the agent wasn't facing the door correctly. Therefore, the correct action now is to turn right to face the door's direction, then move forward once to be in front, then toggle. However, in the current observation, the door is 2 steps right and 1 step forward. If I turn right, then the forward direction is east, and the door is two steps to the right (which would be north two steps from the new forward direction). Wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe the door's position is relative to the agent's current orientation. Let's suppose the agent is facing north. Then, ""right"" is east, ""forward"" is north. The door is 2 steps right (east) and 1 step forward (north). So from the agent's position, the door is diagonally northeast. To reach it, the agent would need to move east two steps and north one step. But to toggle the door, the agent needs to be in front of it, i.e., facing the door. So maybe the agent needs to face northeast, but that's not one of the allowed actions (only turn left/right, go forward). Turning left or right changes the facing direction by 90 degrees each time.

Alternatively, perhaps the door is in the agent's forward path after turning right. Let me think: if the agent turns right (east), then the door is two steps east and one step north. But from the agent's new forward direction (east), the door is two steps to the left (west) and one step north. That doesn't make sense. Maybe the coordinate system is different. Alternatively, maybe ""right"" and ""forward"" are relative to the agent's current facing. So if the agent is facing north, right is east, forward is north. The door is 2 steps east and 1 step north. So from the agent's current position, the door is northeast. To get there, the agent would have to move east two steps and north one step, but the agent can only move forward and turn. So turning right (east) and moving two steps forward would get to the eastern wall (since there's a wall 2 steps right in the current observation). Wait, no. The current observation says a wall 2 steps right and a wall 3 steps forward. Wait, in the latest observation before this, the walls are: wall 4 steps forward, wall 2 steps right, and the door is 2 steps right and 1 forward. So if I'm facing north, right is east. The wall is 2 steps east (right) and 4 steps north (forward). So if I turn right (east), then move forward, I'd hit the wall after 2 steps. But the door is 2 steps east and 1 step north. So from the agent's position, if I turn right (east), then move forward one step, that would place me one step east. Then, from there, to get to the door's position (two steps east and one step north), I need to move north, but the agent can't move north directly; it can only move forward, which is east in this case. So perhaps the coordinate system is such that after turning right, forward is east, but the door's position is relative to the original direction. This is getting too complicated. Maybe the simplest way is to try to face the door and then toggle.

Alternatively, the agent might need to adjust their position. Let's see: the door is 2 steps right and 1 step forward. If the agent turns right, then the door is 2 steps to the left (west) and 1 step forward. That doesn't help. If the agent turns left (west), then the door is 2 steps right (east) and 1 step forward. Still not directly in front. Maybe the agent needs to move forward towards the door. But the wall is 3 steps forward in the current observation. Wait, in the latest observation, the walls are: wall 3 steps forward, wall 2 steps right. So if the agent is facing north, moving forward three steps would hit the wall. The door is 2 steps right and 1 step forward, so if the agent turns right (east), then the door is two steps east and one step north. But moving forward east two steps would hit the wall (since the wall is 2 steps right, which is east two steps from the original position). So that's not possible. Therefore, the door must be in a different direction. Maybe the agent is facing east? Let's consider that. If the agent is facing east, then right is south, forward is east. The door is 2 steps right (south) and 1 step forward (east). So from the agent's position, the door is east one step and south two steps. To reach it, the agent would have to move forward (east) one step, then turn south (right), then move two steps, but that's not straightforward. This is getting too confusing without knowing the agent's current facing direction.

Perhaps the best approach is to try to toggle the door again, assuming that the previous attempt failed due to not being in the correct position. But according to the observation, the door is still locked, so maybe the agent isn't in front of it. Alternatively, the agent needs to move closer. However, given the walls, moving forward might not be possible. Wait, in the current observation, the walls are 3 steps forward and 2 steps right. So if the agent is facing north, moving forward three steps is a wall. The door is 2 steps right (east) and 1 step forward (north). So if the agent turns right (east), then moves forward two steps (but there's a wall two steps east), so that's not possible. Therefore, the door must be in a different direction. Maybe the agent is facing south? Let's try that. If facing south, right is east, forward is south. The door is 2 steps right (east) and 1 step forward (south). So from the agent's position, the door is east two steps and south one step. To reach it, the agent would need to turn right (east), move two steps, then move south one step. But moving south isn't an action; the agent can only move forward, which would be east in this case. So this doesn't work. Alternatively, if the agent is facing west, then right is north, forward is west. The door is 2 steps right (north) and 1 step forward (west). So the door is north two steps and west one step from the agent. To reach it, the agent would have to turn right (north), move two steps, then move west one step, but again, movement is restricted to forward.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe the correct action is to toggle the door again, assuming that the previous direction was incorrect and the agent needs to reposition. Alternatively, the agent should try to move towards the door's position. But given the walls, movement might be blocked. Wait, in the current observation, the walls are 3 steps forward and 2 steps right. So if the agent is facing north, moving forward three steps is a wall. Moving right two steps (east) is also a wall. But the door is at 2 steps right and 1 step forward, which would be east two steps and north one step. But east two steps is a wall, so that can't be. Therefore, there must be a mistake in my understanding. Perhaps the walls are in different directions based on the agent's facing. Alternatively, maybe the coordinates are absolute regardless of the agent's facing. For example, ""right"" and ""forward"" are relative to the agent's current orientation. So if the agent turns left or right, the directions change accordingly.

Let me try a different approach. The agent has the yellow key, and the door is locked and yellow. The only way to open it is to toggle it while facing it. So the agent must be positioned directly in front of the door. Given the observations, the door is 2 steps right and 1 step forward. So the agent needs to adjust their direction so that the door is directly in front. For example, if the agent turns right (east), then the door is 1 step forward (since it's 2 steps right and 1 forward from the original position). Wait, no. If the agent turns right, their forward direction becomes east. The door's position relative to the agent's original position was 2 steps east and 1 step north. After turning right, the agent's forward is east, so the door is 1 step north and 2 steps west (from the new forward direction). That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe after turning right, the door is 2 steps to the agent's left (west) and 1 step forward. That still doesn't help.

 Perhaps the correct action is to turn left instead. If the agent turns left (west), their forward direction becomes west. The door is 2 steps east and 1 step north. So from the agent's new position, the door is 3 steps east (which would be 1 step west from the agent's new forward direction) and 1 step north. This is still not directly in front.

This is really tricky without knowing the agent's current orientation. Given the previous actions, maybe the agent was trying to approach the door by moving forward, but the walls are blocking the path. The latest observation shows the door at 2 steps right and 1 step forward. The agent has to get to a position where they are facing the door directly. The only way to do that is to turn in the correct direction and then move forward appropriately. Since the previous attempts to toggle failed, the agent must not be facing the door correctly. 

Given the door's position (2 right, 1 forward), if the agent turns right, then their forward direction is east. The door is 2 steps east and 1 step north. To face the door, the agent would need to turn north, but they can only turn left or right. Turning left from facing east would make them face north, then they could move forward north one step, but movement is restricted to forward (east). So they can't move north directly. Therefore, it's impossible to face the door by only turning left or right and moving forward. This suggests that the door's position is actually in a direction that the agent can reach by adjusting their movement. 

Wait, maybe the agent is facing east. Then, right is south, forward is east. The door is 2 steps right (south) and 1 step forward (east). So the door is one step east and two steps south. To reach it, the agent would need to move forward (east) one step, then turn right (south), then move two steps. But the agent can't move south directly; they can only move forward, which would be east in this case. So this isn't possible. 

I'm stuck. The only possible action that makes sense here is to toggle the door again, but that didn't work before. Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to move closer. But given the walls, moving forward or right might not be possible. Wait, in the current observation, the wall is 3 steps forward and 2 steps right. So if the agent is facing north, they can't move forward three steps, and turning right (east) would allow moving two steps before hitting a wall. But the door is at 2 steps east and 1 step north. So if the agent turns right (east), moves two steps forward (hit the wall), then can't proceed. 

This seems like a dead end. The only remaining action is to toggle the door, but since it's locked and the agent has the key, maybe the previous attempt was incorrect. However, the observation still shows the door as locked, implying the key wasn't used yet. Therefore, the agent must be in the correct position to toggle the door. Wait, the agent has the key, so once they toggle the door, it should open. But the door is locked, so toggling requires the key. Therefore, the agent must be in front of the door and have the key to toggle it and open it. 

Given that, the correct action is to toggle the door. Even though the previous attempt failed, perhaps the agent wasn't in the correct position. But according to the observation, the door's position hasn't changed. So maybe the agent needs to adjust their position. However, given the walls, movement is limited. The only possible movement is to go forward, but the wall is three steps forward. Turning left or right might allow movement. 

Wait, if the agent turns left (west), then their forward direction is west. The wall is two steps right (east) from the agent's current position. So turning left, moving forward would be west. There's no wall mentioned in that direction. The door is 2 steps right (east) and 1 step forward (north) from the original position. If the agent turns left (west), their forward direction is west, and the door is now 3 steps east (from the agent's new position) and 1 step north. Still not directly in front. 

This is really confusing. Maybe the correct action is to toggle the door again, assuming that the previous failure was due to a different reason, like not having the key, but the agent does have the key. Therefore, the correct action should be to toggle the door. The only possible valid action here is toggle.

Let's analyze the situation step by step. The player is carrying a yellow key, and the observation shows a locked yellow door located 2 steps to the right and 1 step forward. The walls are positioned 3 steps forward and 2 steps to the right.

The key here is that the door is locked and matches the color of the key the player has. Typically, in such games, a locked door of a specific color requires the corresponding colored key to unlock it. Since the player is holding the yellow key, the logical action would be to interact with the door. 

Looking at the possible actions: 'toggle' is used to manipulate objects in front of the player. The door is in front of the player (1 step forward and 2 steps right). The player's current position must be such that the door is directly in front when facing the correct direction. If the player is facing north, moving right twice would position them to face the door. However, the player's exact orientation isn't specified, but based on previous actions and the movement history, it's reasonable to assume they are positioned correctly to toggle the door once they're in front.

Previously, the player tried 'toggle' but the door remained locked. That might be because the player wasn't close enough or facing the wrong direction. However, the current observation states the door is 1 step forward and 2 steps right. If the player is facing the direction where moving forward brings them towards the door's location, then toggling again with the key should work. But if the door is not directly in front, the toggle might not interact with it. 

Another consideration: the player might need to adjust their position to face the door directly. For example, if the door is 2 steps right and 1 step forward, the player might need to turn right to face the door's position. However, the walls are 2 steps to the right, so turning right might not be possible without hitting a wall. Alternatively, the player could move forward once to reduce the distance, but the observation already shows the door is 1 step forward, meaning they are just one step away.

Given that the player has the correct key and the door is within range, the correct action should be 'toggle' again. The previous failures might have been due to orientation or proximity, but the current observation indicates proximity is correct (1 step forward). Therefore, toggling the door with the key should unlock it.

14,Failed to obtain a valid action from the reasoning.,"<reasoning>
Let's see. The current observation says I'm carrying a yellow key. There's a wall 3 steps forward and another wall 2 steps to the right. The main thing here is the locked yellow door that's 2 steps to the right and 1 step forward.

So, the door is locked and yellow, which probably means I need the yellow key. Since I already have the yellow key, the next step is to use it on the door. The door's position is 2 steps right and 1 step forward. Let me figure out how to get there.

Right now, my direction might be important. If the door is 2 steps right and 1 step forward, maybe I need to face the correct direction. Let me check previous observations. Earlier, when the door was 2 steps left and 4 steps forward, the agent turned left. But in the current state, the door is to the right. 

Wait, the user's previous actions included turning left, going forward, and trying to toggle the door. But toggling the door without being in the right position might not work. To toggle an object, I need to be directly facing it. 

In the last few steps, the user was trying to get closer to the door. For example, moving forward when the door was 2 steps left and 3 steps forward. Now, the door is 2 steps right and 1 step forward. So maybe the agent needs to adjust their direction. 

If the door is 2 steps right and 1 step forward, perhaps the agent is currently facing a direction where forward leads towards the door but they need to turn right to face it properly. Alternatively, maybe they need to move forward once to reduce the distance. 

But the key here is that the door is locked, and the only way to unlock it is by using the yellow key. The action 'toggle' is used to manipulate the object in front of you. So once the agent is directly facing the door, they can toggle it, which would use the key to unlock it. 

Looking at the current observation, the agent is carrying the key, and the door is 2 steps to the right and 1 step forward. So the agent needs to position themselves so that they are facing the door. If they are currently facing north, then to get to the door which is east (right) and north (forward), maybe they need to turn right to face east, then move forward once to reach the door. But in the current state, the door is 2 steps right and 1 step forward. So if the agent turns right (east), then moves forward once, they would be 1 step away from the door. Then toggling would work. 

But in the previous steps, the agent was moving forward multiple times to get closer. However, in the latest observation, the door is 2 steps right and 1 step forward. So perhaps the agent needs to first turn right to face the correct direction, then move forward once, and then toggle. 

Wait, but in the current observation, the agent's position relative to the door is 2 steps right and 1 step forward. So the agent is likely facing a direction where left is towards the door's position. Wait, maybe the agent is facing south, so moving forward would go south, but the door is to the right (east) and 1 step forward (north). Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to visualize it. 

Assume the agent is at a point (0,0). Suppose the door is at (2, 1). The walls are in certain positions. The agent needs to get to the door's location. Since the door is 2 steps right and 1 step forward, that means from the agent's current position, turning right (east) and moving forward (north) would get closer. Wait, maybe the agent is facing north. If the door is 2 steps east and 1 step north, then the agent would need to turn right (east), then move forward once to reach the door's position. Then toggle. 

But in the current observation, the door is 2 steps right and 1 step forward. So if the agent is facing north, then right is east. Moving forward once would take them north, but the door is east and north. So maybe after turning right (east), moving forward once would position them 1 step east and 0 steps forward from the original position. Then they need to move forward again to reach the door. Wait, but the door is 2 steps right and 1 step forward. So maybe after turning right, the agent needs to move forward once, then toggle. But the door is still 2 steps right and 1 step forward from the current position. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the coordinate system. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent is facing a direction where 'forward' is towards the door's location. For example, if the agent is facing east, then moving forward would take them east. But the door is 2 steps right (south?) and 1 step forward (east?). This is a bit unclear. 

Alternatively, perhaps the door's position is relative to the agent's current direction. So if the agent is facing north, then 'right' is east. So the door being 2 steps right and 1 step forward would mean it's 2 steps east and 1 step north from the agent's current position. To reach it, the agent would need to turn right (east), then move forward once (north), but that would only get them 1 step north and 1 step east. Then they need to move forward again to get to the door's position. 

But in the current observation, after moving forward a few times, the door's distance might have decreased. However, in the latest observation, the door is 2 steps right and 1 step forward. So perhaps the agent hasn't reached that position yet. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent is already in a position where they can toggle the door. But the problem is that the door is locked, so toggling it without the key won't work. Since the agent has the key, they need to be in front of the door to toggle it. 

So the correct sequence would be: turn to face the door, move forward until in front of it, then toggle. 

In the current observation, the door is 2 steps right and 1 step forward. So if the agent is facing north, then turning right (east) would make the door 2 steps east and 1 step north. Then moving forward once would take them to the east, but the door is still 1 step north. So maybe after turning right, move forward once, then turn north, move forward once, then toggle. But this seems convoluted. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to adjust their direction first. For example, if the agent turns left, perhaps they can face a direction where moving forward gets them closer to the door. 

This is getting a bit confusing. Let's look at the previous actions. The user had been moving forward multiple times, trying to get closer to the door, then toggling. But toggling without being directly in front of the door wouldn't work. 

So in the current state, the agent needs to position themselves directly facing the door. Since the door is 2 steps right and 1 step forward, the agent should turn right (so that right is towards the door's position) and then move forward once to be in front of it. Then toggle. 

But how to interpret ""2 steps right and 1 step forward""? If the agent is facing north, then ""right"" would be east, and ""forward"" would be north. So the door is 2 steps east and 1 step north from the agent's current position. To get to the door, the agent needs to turn right (east), then move forward 1 step (to be east of the original position), then move forward another step north to reach the door. Wait, but the door is 1 step forward from the agent's current position after turning right. 

Alternatively, maybe the door's position is calculated based on the agent's current direction. So if the agent is facing north, then ""right"" is east, and ""forward"" is north. So the door is 2 steps to the east (right) and 1 step north (forward) from the agent's current position. To reach the door, the agent would need to move east twice and north once. But moving forward would be north, and turning right would face east. 

So the correct actions would be: turn right (east), go forward once (to be 1 step east), then go forward again (to be 2 steps east and 0 steps north?), but the door is 2 steps east and 1 step north. Hmm, this is conflicting. 

Alternatively, maybe after turning right, moving forward once would place the agent at the door's location. But the observation says the door is 2 steps right and 1 step forward, so maybe the agent needs to move forward twice after turning right. 

Wait, perhaps the agent is currently facing a direction where moving forward reduces the forward distance to the door. For example, if the agent is facing south, then moving forward would take them south, but the door is north. That wouldn't help. 

This is getting too complicated. The key point is that the door is locked and requires the yellow key. The agent has the key, so the next step is to use it on the door. To do that, the agent must be directly facing the door and then toggle it. 

Given the current observation, the door is 2 steps right and 1 step forward. The agent needs to adjust their direction to face the door. If the agent turns right, they would be facing the direction where the door is 2 steps away. Then moving forward once would reduce the distance to 1 step, and toggling would use the key. But the door's position is still 2 steps right and 1 forward, so maybe the agent needs to turn right and then move forward twice. 

Alternatively, the agent might be facing a direction where forward leads towards the door. For example, if the agent is facing east, then moving forward would go east, and the door is 2 steps right (south?) and 1 step forward (east?). This is unclear without a clear coordinate system. 

Given the ambiguity, the safest bet is to assume that the agent needs to face the door and then toggle it. Since the door is 2 steps right and 1 step forward, the agent should turn right to face the east direction, then move forward once to be 1 step east, then move forward again to reach the door. But in the current observation, after moving forward, the door's distance might have decreased. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent can toggle the door without being directly in front, but according to the game rules, 'toggle' is used to manipulate the object in front of you. So the agent must be facing the door to toggle it. 

Given that, the correct actions would be: turn right, then move forward once, then toggle. But in the current observation, the door is 2 steps right and 1 step forward. So after turning right, moving forward once would make the door 1 step forward. Then toggling would work. 

Wait, if the agent turns right, their forward direction is now east. The door is 2 steps east and 1 step north. So moving forward once (east) would take them to the east, but the door is still 1 step north. So they need to move forward again (north) to reach the door. But how does that fit into the actions? 

This is getting too confusing. Maybe the best approach is to keep moving forward until the door is directly in front, then toggle. But in the current observation, the door is 2 steps right and 1 step forward. So perhaps the agent needs to turn right, move forward once, then toggle. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent is already facing a direction where the door is directly ahead. For example, if the agent is facing northeast, then moving forward could reach the door. But without knowing the agent's current direction, it's hard to say. 

Given the previous actions, the agent was moving forward multiple times to get closer to the door. In the latest observations, the door's distance decreased from 4 steps to 2 steps. So maybe continuing to move forward will get the agent closer. However, in the current observation, the door is 2 steps right and 1 step forward. If the agent moves forward once, they would be 1 step forward from the door's position. But the door is 2 steps right and 1 step forward, so moving forward would reduce the forward distance to 1 step, but the right distance remains 2 steps. 

Alternatively, turning right and moving forward would adjust the direction. 

I think the correct action here is to toggle the door, but only if the agent is directly facing it. However, in the current observation, the door is 2 steps right and 1 step forward, which suggests the agent is not directly facing it. Therefore, the agent needs to adjust their direction first. 

Given that the door is to the right and forward, the agent should turn right to face east, then move forward once to reduce the forward distance to 1 step. Then toggle. 

But according to the current observation, after turning right and moving forward once, the door would be 1 step forward. Then toggling would use the key to unlock it. 

So the sequence should be: turn right, go forward, toggle. 

But in the current observation, the agent's previous action was 'toggle' and the observation didn't change, meaning they weren't facing the door. 

Therefore, the correct action now is to turn right to face the correct direction, then move forward, then toggle. 

However, the user's previous answer was 'toggle', which didn't work because they weren't facing the door. 

So in the current observation, the agent should first turn right to adjust their direction, then move forward once, then toggle. 

But the problem is that the agent has to choose exactly one action per step. So the next action should be to turn right to face the door's direction. 

Looking at the current observation: the door is 2 steps right and 1 step forward. If the agent turns right, their new forward direction is east. The door is now 2 steps east and 1 step north. To get to the door, they need to move east twice and north once. But that's two move forward actions. However, the agent can only choose one action at a time. 

Alternatively, maybe after turning right, moving forward once brings the door to 1 step forward, then toggling. 

But how does the direction affect the 'forward' action? If the agent turns right, then 'forward' is east. The door is 2 steps east and 1 step north. So moving forward once (east) would take them to the east, but the door is still 1 step north. So they need to turn north and move forward. 

This is getting too complex without knowing the exact coordinate system. 

Given the uncertainty, the safest action is to turn right to face the direction where the door is located, then move forward, and then toggle. But since we can only choose one action per step, the next logical step is to turn right to face the correct direction. 

Alternatively, if the agent is already facing a direction where moving forward will lead them towards the door, then moving forward is the way to go. 

But in the current observation, the door is 2 steps right and 1 step forward. If the agent is facing north, then right is east, and forward is north. So the door is 2 steps east and 1 step north. To reach it, the agent needs to move east twice and north once. But that's two moves east and one move north. 

Alternatively, if the agent turns right (east), then moves forward twice, they would be 2 steps east, and then turn north and move forward once. But again, this is multiple steps. 

Given the game's context, the agent needs to use the key on the door. The most logical action now is to toggle the door, but only if they are facing it. Since the previous attempts to toggle didn't work, the agent must not be facing the door. 

Therefore, the correct action is to turn right to face the door's direction, then move forward, and then toggle. But since we can only choose one action, the next step is to turn right. 

Alternatively, if turning right allows the agent to face a direction where moving forward will get them closer, then turning right and moving forward would be better. 

Given the ambiguity, the best action is to 'toggle' only if the agent is facing the door. Since they weren't before, the agent needs to adjust their direction. 

The current observation shows the door is 2 steps right and 1 step forward. Turning right would make the door 2 steps forward and 1 step north. Then moving forward twice would get the agent to the door. But again, multiple steps. 

In conclusion, the most logical next action is to 'toggle' the door, but only if the agent is facing it. Since previous toggles didn't work, the agent isn't facing it. Therefore, the correct action is to turn right to face the door's direction, then move forward, then toggle. 

Given the constraints of choosing one action per step, the next action should be to turn right. 

But wait, in the current observation, after turning right, the agent's forward direction is east, and the door is 2 steps east and 1 step north. So moving forward once would take them east, but the door is still north. So after turning right, the agent needs to move forward once, then turn north, then move forward once, then toggle. But that's multiple steps. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent can turn north first. But the door is 2 steps right and 1 step forward. If the agent turns north, their forward direction is north, and right is east. The door is 2 steps east and 1 step north. So moving forward once (north) would place them 1 step north, then turning right (east) and moving forward twice would reach the door. 

This is getting too convoluted. Given the time constraints, the best action is to 'toggle' the door, assuming the agent is facing it. But since previous toggles didn't work, the agent isn't facing it. Therefore, the correct action is to turn right to face the door's east direction, then move forward once, then toggle. 

But since we can only do one action at a time, the next action should be to turn right. 

Alternatively, if the agent turns left instead, maybe that positions them better. 

Wait, in the previous observations, when the door was 2 steps left and 4 steps forward, the agent turned left. Then moved forward. So perhaps turning left again would adjust their direction. 

In the current observation, the door is 2 steps right and 1 step forward. If the agent turns left, their forward direction becomes west. The door is 2 steps east and 1 step north. That doesn't seem helpful. 

Therefore, turning right seems better. 

Final decision: The agent should turn right to face the door's east direction, then move forward once, then toggle. Since we can only choose one","

Let's see. The current observation says I'm carrying a yellow key. There's a wall 2 steps forward and a locked yellow door 2 steps to the right. The previous actions were toggling the door multiple times, but it's still locked. Maybe I need to get closer to the door first.

Since the door is 2 steps to the right, and there's a wall 2 steps forward, I should check my current direction. Earlier steps might have me facing a direction where forward is the wall. If I turn right, that would face the door, which is 2 steps right. Wait, the door is 2 steps right, so if I'm facing the right direction, going forward would get me to the door. But the problem is the door is locked and requires the yellow key, which I already have. But maybe I need to be in the right position to toggle it. 

Previous attempts to toggle didn't work, perhaps because I wasn't facing the door. So first, I should turn right to face the door's location. Then move forward until I'm in front of it. Once close enough, toggle the door. Let me check the last observation again: the door is 2 steps right. If I turn right, then go forward two steps, I'd be in front of the door. Then toggle. But in the last observation, after moving forward, the door is still 2 steps right. Wait, maybe after moving forward, the distance changed? Hmm, not sure. But the key point is that the door is locked and requires the key. Since I have the key, toggling it should unlock. Maybe I just need to be adjacent to it. Let me try turning right to face the door's position, then go forward until it's in front, then toggle. So the next action should be turning right to face the door, then moving forward, then toggling. But the latest observation shows the door is 2 steps right. So first, turn right, then go forward once. Then toggle. But the current observation after previous steps might have me facing a direction where right is towards the door. Let me confirm. The user's last observation says the door is 2 steps right. If I'm currently facing a direction where right is towards the door, then turning right would make me face away. Wait, maybe I need to adjust my direction first. Let me think again. If the door is 2 steps to the right, perhaps I should turn left to face the door. Wait, no. Let's clarify directions. Suppose the agent is facing north. If the door is 2 steps to the right (east), then turning right would face east, so moving forward would take them towards the door. But the observation mentions the door is 2 steps right. So the agent needs to face the direction where right is towards the door. Alternatively, perhaps the agent needs to be facing the door's location. This is getting a bit confusing. Let me recap the latest observation:

Observation:
You carry a yellow key
a wall 2 steps forward
a locked yellow door 2 steps right

So, the agent is facing a direction where forward is a wall, and to the right is the locked yellow door. Therefore, to reach the door, the agent needs to turn right (to face the door's location) and then move forward. But since the door is 2 steps right, turning right would make forward be the direction of the door. Wait, no. If the agent is facing north, then right is east. If the door is 2 steps east (right), then turning right (to face east) and moving forward would take them towards the door. But in the current observation, moving forward is a wall. So the agent must be facing a direction where forward is the wall, and right is the door's location. So, to get to the door, the agent needs to turn right (to face the door's direction) and then move forward. But in the current state, moving forward is a wall. Wait, that can't be. Let me parse the observation again:

- Wall 2 steps forward
- Locked yellow door 2 steps right

So, if the agent is facing north, then forward is north (wall), right is east (door is 2 steps east). Therefore, the agent should turn right (to face east) and then move forward twice to reach the door. But in the current observation, after moving forward before, the wall is 2 steps forward. So perhaps the agent is facing north, with a wall directly north (2 steps) and the door 2 steps east (right). Therefore, the correct sequence is:

1. Turn right (now facing east)
2. Go forward twice (to reach the door)
3. Toggle the door

But in the latest observation, the door is 2 steps right. So after turning right, moving forward once would make it 1 step right, then another step to reach it. But according to the observation, the door is 2 steps right. So maybe the agent hasn't turned right yet. So the next action should be to turn right to face the door's direction, then move forward. Since the current observation shows the door is 2 steps right, turning right would align the agent to face towards the door, and moving forward once would reduce the distance to 1 step. Then toggle. But the previous attempts to toggle didn't work, so maybe proximity is required. Let me check the last few steps. The user's history shows that after picking up the key, they tried toggling the door but it didn't work. Then they turned left, moved forward, etc., but the door stayed locked. Now, the current observation is that the door is 2 steps right. The agent has the key. So the correct action should be to turn right, move forward until adjacent, then toggle. So the next action is to turn right to face the door's direction. Then, in the next step, go forward. But in the current observation, the agent's forward is a wall. So perhaps they need to reorient. Therefore, the immediate action is to turn right to face the door's location, allowing them to move forward towards it. Then, once close enough, toggle. Since the previous toggles didn't work, maybe they weren't adjacent. So first, turn right, then go forward. Then toggle.

Let's see. The current observation says I'm carrying a yellow key. There's a wall 2 steps left and a locked yellow door 2 steps forward. So, the door matches the color of the key I have. The goal is to open the door.

First, I need to be facing the door. The door is 2 steps forward, so I should be positioned to go forward twice. But according to the last observation, after some movement, the door is 2 steps forward. The previous actions involved moving forward and turning left/right to get into position. 

Wait, the last few steps: I was toggling the door but it didn't work. Maybe I wasn't in the right position. The door is locked, and since I have the yellow key, I need to use it on the door. But to toggle the door, I have to be directly in front of it. The observation says the door is 2 steps forward, so I need to move closer. 

So the correct action here would be to go forward once to get to the door. Then, when I'm right in front of it, I can toggle it, which should use the key to unlock it. But first, I need to close the distance. Let's check the observation again: the door is 2 steps forward, so moving forward once will put me right at it. Then I can toggle. But in the current observation, after moving forward, the door is still 2 steps forward? Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me retrace.

In the previous steps, the user had me toggle the door multiple times, but it didn't work because maybe I wasn't adjacent to it. The key here is that the door is locked and requires the yellow key. To toggle the door, you have to be in front of it. So the sequence should be: move towards the door until it's directly in front (1 step), then toggle. 

Looking at the current observation, the door is 2 steps forward. So I need to go forward once to get to the door. Then toggle. That should unlock it. So the next action should be go forward. If I do that, then the next observation should have the door 1 step forward, and then I can toggle it successfully with the key.

Let's see. The current observation says I'm carrying a yellow key. There's a wall 2 steps to the left, and a locked yellow door 1 step forward. The goal is to open the door.

The door is locked and yellow, which must match the yellow key I have. So, the next logical step is to interact with the door. The available action to manipulate objects in front is 'toggle'. Since the door is 1 step forward, I should toggle it to try opening it with the key. Let me double-check: am I holding the correct key? Yes, it's a yellow key, and the door is locked yellow. Toggling the door should use the key to unlock it. I don't need to go forward anymore because the door is right in front. So the correct action here is 'toggle'.
