0,turn right,"<reasoning>
Let's see where I need to go. The goal is to reach the purple box. Right now, my current observation is that there's a wall 4 steps forward and a wall 1 step to the left. So I can't go forward directly because there's a wall blocking the path. Also, the wall on my left means I can't turn left and go that way either.

First, I should check where I'm facing. Since there's a wall 4 steps forward, maybe I'm facing north, and the wall is in that direction. The wall on the left would then be east if I'm facing north, because to my left (east) is a wall 1 step away. But wait, if there's a wall 4 steps forward and a wall 1 step left, my possible directions might be different. Let me visualize this.

Assuming I'm facing north. So forward is north, left is west. But the observation says a wall 1 step left. If left is west, but there's a wall 1 step west, then maybe I'm facing east? Because left from east is north. Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me clarify the directions.

If I'm facing north, then left is west. So if there's a wall 1 step left (west), that would block that direction. And 4 steps forward (north) is also a wall. So I can't go north or west. Then my possible directions would be east or south. But how do I know which direction I'm facing? The problem is, the observation doesn't specify my current facing direction. That's a bit of a problem. Without knowing where I'm facing, it's hard to plan the path.

Alternatively, maybe the walls are in fixed positions relative to me. Let's think differently. If there's a wall 4 steps forward and a wall 1 step left, perhaps turning right would open up a path. Let's say I turn right (east), then my forward direction is east. If there's no wall there, maybe I can proceed. But how do I know if turning right is safe?

Wait, the problem is that the observation doesn't give my current heading. So maybe I need to try turning in a direction to see if there's a path. Since going forward is blocked, turning right or left might be necessary. Let's try turning right first. If I turn right, then maybe I can go forward without hitting a wall. Alternatively, turning left (west) but the wall is only 1 step left, so maybe I can turn left and go forward? Wait, the left wall is 1 step, so if I turn left (west), then forward would be west, but there's a wall 1 step west. So that's still blocked.

Alternatively, perhaps turning right (east) and moving forward. Let me think. If I turn right, my forward direction is east. The original observation was walls 4 steps forward (north) and 1 step left (west). After turning right, the new forward direction is east. Now, is there a wall in the new forward direction? The original observation didn't mention a wall in that direction, so maybe it's clear. So if I turn right and go forward, I can move east away from the walls. That might be a good approach. Then I can explore that direction to find the purple box.

Alternatively, turning left would face me south, but again, the original walls are in north and west. So turning left (west) and moving forward would hit the wall. Not helpful. So the best bet is to turn right (east) and proceed forward. That way, I can navigate around the walls and move towards the purple box. Let me confirm. If I turn right, then my forward direction is east. There's no mention of a wall there, so I can safely move forward. That seems like the correct action. So the first action should be to turn right, then go forward. But the problem requires choosing exactly one action here. Since I need to act based on the current observation, and the immediate problem is the walls blocking forward and left, turning right is the best initial action to avoid the walls and explore a new direction.

 <sep> human:","a wall 6 steps forward
a wall 3 steps right
a purple box 2 steps right and 1 step forward",0,False
1,go forward,"<reasoning>

Let's see. The current observation says there's a wall 6 steps forward, a wall 3 steps right, and a purple box 2 steps right and 1 step forward. The goal is to reach the purple box.

Hmm, so from the previous action, I turned right, which probably made me face a new direction. Now, I need to figure out where I'm facing. If the wall is 6 steps forward, and another wall 3 steps right, maybe I'm facing north? But the purple box is 2 steps right and 1 forward. Let me visualize this.

Assuming I'm facing north:

- Wall 6 steps forward (north) means I can't go north further.
- Wall 3 steps right (east) would be to my right.
- The purple box is 2 east and 1 north. But north is blocked by the wall. So maybe I need to adjust my direction?

Wait, maybe I'm facing east now. If I turned right from the initial direction, perhaps I was facing north before, turned right to face east. Then:

- Wall 6 steps forward (east) is in front.
- Wall 3 steps right (south) is to my right.
- The purple box is 2 east (but east is blocked) and 1 forward (which would be south, but south isn't mentioned). Hmm, maybe I need to reorient.

Alternatively, maybe I'm facing south. Let's think again. If I turned right once, maybe from facing north to east, but that still doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps after turning right, I'm facing east, but the forward wall is 6 steps, so east is blocked. The purple box is 2 right (which would be south if facing east) and 1 forward (which would be south east?). This is getting confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the current facing direction is southeast? Not sure. Let's approach this step by step.

The purple box is 2 steps right and 1 step forward. If I need to get there, I need to move in a direction where moving forward and right gets me there. Let's suppose ""right"" is east and ""forward"" is north. So if the box is 2 east and 1 north, but there's a wall 6 north (forward) and a wall 3 east (right). Wait, that doesn't add up. If forward is north, then moving north is blocked. So how can the box be 1 step north? Maybe the directions are relative to my current facing.

Alternatively, maybe after turning right, my forward direction is now east, and right would be south. So the purple box is 2 steps to the new right (south) and 1 step forward (east). But there's a wall 3 steps right (south), which is blocking that direction. So I can't go south 3 steps. The box is only 2 steps south, but the wall is at 3. So perhaps I can move south 2 steps, but the wall is blocking further. Wait, but the wall is 3 steps right, which would be 3 steps south from my current position.

Hmm. Let's try to map this out. Let's assume I'm facing east now (after turning right). Then:

- Forward (east) has a wall 6 steps away.
- Right (south) has a wall 3 steps.
- The purple box is 2 steps right (south) and 1 step forward (east).

Wait, but if I'm facing east, moving right would be south. So the box is 2 steps south and 1 east. But moving east is blocked by a wall after 6 steps. So moving forward (east) isn't possible. To reach the box, I need to go south 2 steps and east 1 step. But east is blocked. So maybe I need to adjust my direction again.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to turn around. If I turn left twice, I'd face west. Then forward would be west, but that's not helpful. Or maybe turn right again to face south. Then forward would be south, but the wall is 3 steps south. The box is 2 steps south and 1 east. If I go south 2 steps (past the wall?), but the wall is at 3 steps. Wait, the wall is 3 steps to the right (south) from here. So if I go south 2 steps, I would reach the box's position, but then I need to go east 1 step. But east is blocked. This seems conflicting.

Wait, maybe the directions are relative to the initial position. Let me try a different approach. The key is that the purple box is 2 steps right and 1 step forward from my current position. So I need to figure out my current direction to know which way right and forward are.

If I turned right from the previous step, let's say I was initially facing north, turned right to face east. Now, the wall is 6 steps forward (east), wall 3 steps right (south). The box is 2 steps right (south) and 1 forward (east). But moving east is blocked. So how can I get to the box? Maybe I need to move south first, then east, but south is blocked after 3 steps. The box is only 2 steps south, so maybe I can go south 2 steps, then east 1 step. But east is blocked after 6 steps, but only 1 step needed. Wait, but if I'm facing east after turning right, moving forward (east) is blocked, but moving south would take me away from east. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I need to turn left instead of right. If I turn left from facing east, I'd face north again. Then forward (north) is blocked by the wall 6 steps. Then the box is 2 steps right (east) and 1 forward (north). But north is blocked. So that doesn't help.

This is confusing. Maybe I should first check if there's a way to navigate around the walls to reach the box. The box is 2 right and 1 forward. If I can turn left (now facing north), then move forward would be north, which is blocked. But if I turn around (turn right twice, facing west), then forward is west. Then right would be south. The box is 2 steps south and 1 west. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe turn right again to face south. Then forward is south, but the wall is 3 steps. The box is 2 steps south, so I could move south 2 steps, then east 1 step. But how?

Wait, if I'm facing south, moving forward (south) 2 steps would reach the box's position (since it's 2 steps right and 1 forward from original). Wait, but the box's position is relative to my current position. Let me clarify:

Current position: Let's assume I'm at (0,0). Directions: Facing east.

- Forward (east) is blocked at 6 steps: so positions (1,0) to (6,0) are walls.
- Right (south) is blocked at 3 steps: so positions (0,1) to (0,3) are walls.
- Purple box is 2 steps right (south) and 1 step forward (east): so position (1,2).

But to get to (1,2) from (0,0), facing east:

- Moving east 1 step to (1,0) (blocked by wall at 6, but only 1 step needed here? Wait, the wall is 6 steps forward, so from (0,0) moving east 6 steps is blocked. But moving east 1 step is (1,0), which is not a wall. The wall is further ahead. So maybe I can move east 1 step, then south 2 steps.

But how do I turn to face south after moving east? If I'm facing east at (1,0), turning right would face south. Then moving south 2 steps to (1,2), which is the box's position. Then I can pick it up.

So the steps would be:

1. go forward (east) 1 step to (1,0). But wait, the initial observation after turning right said ""a wall 6 steps forward"" and ""a wall 3 steps right"". If I move forward (east) from (0,0), after 1 step, there's no wall yet. The wall is 6 steps forward, so I can move east until step 6. But I only need to move 1 step to get to (1,0). Then turn right to face south, move south 2 steps to (1,2), which is the box. Then pick up.

But in the current observation, the purple box is 2 steps right and 1 forward. So from current position, right is south, forward is east. So moving forward 1 (east) then right (south) 2 steps would reach the box.

But in the current observation, the purple box is 2 steps right and 1 forward. So the action to take would be to go forward first, then right, then go forward again? Wait, let me think.

Alternatively, after turning right (facing east), the box is 2 steps right (south) and 1 step forward (east). So to reach the box, I need to move 1 step east (forward), then 2 steps south (right). But moving east 1 step is possible because the wall is 6 steps away. So the first action should be go forward (move east 1 step), then turn right (face south), then go forward 2 steps (south) to reach the box's position. Then pick up.

But the current observation lists the purple box's position as 2 steps right and 1 forward. So the next action should be to go forward, as that's 1 step towards the box.

So the chosen action is go forward.

2,Failed to obtain a valid action from the reasoning.,"<reasoning>
Let's see. The current observation says there's a wall 5 steps forward and a purple box 2 steps to the right. From the previous actions, the agent turned right and then went forward. Now, based on the latest observation, the purple box is located 2 steps to the right.

I need to figure out where the agent is facing. Earlier, after turning right once, if the agent went forward, their direction might be such that moving right from their current position brings them towards the purple box. The wall in front (5 steps) suggests that moving straight ahead isn't the direction of the box.

Since the box is 2 steps to the right, the agent should turn right again to face the direction where the box is. Once facing the correct direction, they can go forward twice to reach the box. But wait, after turning right, they need to check if there's a wall in the new direction. But in the current observation, the wall is still 5 steps forward, which would be in the original direction. So turning right would face them in a new direction where the box is located. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent is facing north, turned right to face east, and the box is 2 steps east and 1 step north. But the current observation only mentions the box being 2 steps right. Hmm. The observation might be simplified, so assuming the agent is facing a direction where turning right allows them to go towards the box. 

So the action should be to turn right to face the direction of the purple box and then move forward twice. But the first action needed here is to turn right so that moving forward will lead towards the box. The agent needs to adjust their direction first. Then, after turning right, they can go forward twice. But in the current observation, the box is 2 steps right, so after turning right, moving forward once would get closer. Wait, maybe the agent needs to turn right once, then go forward once, then check again. But according to the latest observation, after the last action (go forward), the purple box is now 2 steps right. So the agent is probably facing a direction where their right is towards the box. So turning right would align them to face the box's direction, then moving forward once would get them closer. But the observation mentions the box is 2 steps right, so after turning right, moving forward once would make it 1 step, then another forward to reach. But the agent's current state might have picked up the box already? Wait, no. The previous actions were turn right, go forward, then in the next observation, the box is 2 steps right. So the agent hasn't picked it up yet. So the correct action here is to turn right to face the box's direction, then go forward once. But according to the current observation, after turning right, moving forward would get closer. However, the agent might need to turn right again? Wait, no. Let me retrace:

First action: turn right (direction changed), then go forward. Then in the next observation, the box is 2 steps right and 1 step forward. Then the agent's next action was go forward, which would reduce the forward distance. Then the current observation has the box 2 steps right. So perhaps after moving forward, the agent turned, but I need to track the agent's direction.

Alternatively, maybe the agent is facing north initially. Turns right (east), moves forward. Now faces east. The box is 2 steps right (east) and 1 step forward (north). But in the current observation, after moving forward, the box is 2 steps right (east) and the forward direction has a wall. Hmm, maybe the agent's direction after the previous steps is east, and the box is 2 steps east. So in the current observation, the box is 2 steps to the right (east), and 5 steps forward (north, which is a wall). So the agent is facing east. Therefore, the box is directly to the east, 2 steps away. So the action should be to go forward once, then again. But since the current observation says the box is 2 steps right, which would be in the same direction as the agent is facing (east), then going forward once would get closer. But the agent needs to move forward twice. However, according to the observation provided, after the previous 'go forward' action, the box is now 2 steps right. Wait, maybe the agent moved forward once towards the box, reducing its distance from 3 to 2 steps right. So now, the agent should move forward once more to reach the box. But the problem is that the agent can't pick up the box unless they are adjacent to it. So the action here should be 'go forward' to get to the box. Then, once adjacent, 'toggle' or 'pick up' (but 'pick up' requires the box to be below them). Wait, the actions include 'pick up' which is used to pick up the object below you. So once the agent is adjacent (one step away), moving forward once would be next to the box, then 'pick up' would pick it up. Wait, but the observation says the box is 2 steps right. So moving forward once would make it 1 step, then another forward to be adjacent? Or does 'right' mean in the agent's current direction? If the agent is facing east, then 'right' would be south. But that might complicate things. Alternatively, the directions are relative. Maybe 'right' and 'left' are relative to the agent's facing direction. So if the agent is facing east, then 'right' is south, 'left' is north. But in the current observation, the box is 2 steps right, which would be south. But there's a wall 5 steps forward (east) and a wall 3 steps right (south). Wait, that doesn't make sense. If the agent is facing east, then right would be south, left would be north. The observation states a wall 5 steps forward (east), a wall 3 steps right (south), and the purple box 2 steps right (south). That would mean the box is south of the agent, behind the wall. But that can't be, because there's a wall 3 steps south. So maybe the directions are not relative. Maybe 'right' and 'left' are absolute directions. But that complicates things. 

Alternatively, perhaps the observations are relative to the agent's current facing. So when the agent turns right, their forward direction changes. So after turning right, forward is east, right is south, left is north. Then, in the current observation, the purple box is 2 steps to the right (south), which would be behind the wall that's 3 steps to the right (south). So the box is south of the agent, but there's a wall 3 steps south. That would block the path. That doesn't make sense. So maybe the observation's directions are absolute. For example, north, south, east, west. So regardless of the agent's facing, 'right' refers to east, 'left' to west. But that would mean that turning right changes the agent's facing direction, but the observations use absolute directions. That might be possible. 

This is getting complicated. Let's try to approach it step by step. 

In the latest observation, the agent sees a wall 5 steps forward, a purple box 2 steps right, and a wall 3 steps right. Assuming that 'forward' is the agent's current facing direction. So if the agent is facing north, then forward is north, right is east, left is west. The wall 5 steps forward is north, the wall 3 steps right is east, and the purple box is 2 steps right (east). So the box is east of the agent, 2 steps away, but there's a wall 3 steps east. That would mean the path to the box is blocked by the wall. That can't be right. Therefore, perhaps the directions in the observation are relative to the agent's current facing. So 'forward' is the direction the agent is facing, 'right' is their right-hand direction, 'left' their left. 

Given that, let's say the agent turned right previously, so now their forward direction is east. The current observation says there's a wall 5 steps forward (east), a wall 3 steps right (south), and a purple box 2 steps right (south). Wait, that would mean the box is south of the agent, 2 steps away, but there's a wall 3 steps south. So the box is behind the wall? That doesn't make sense. So perhaps the observation is not relative. Maybe 'right' is a fixed direction, like east. So regardless of the agent's facing, 'right' is always east. But then turning right would change the agent's facing, but the observation's directions remain fixed. That's possible. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent's direction affects how they perceive directions. For example, if the agent is facing north, then 'right' is east, 'left' is west. But in the observation, the directions are described relative to the agent's current position, not their facing. 

This is getting too ambiguous. Let's try a different approach. The agent's goal is to get to the purple box. In the current observation, the purple box is 2 steps to the right. The walls are 5 steps forward and 3 steps right. The agent needs to navigate to the box. 

Assuming that 'right' is a 90-degree turn from the agent's current facing. So if the agent is facing north, turning right makes them face east. Then, 'right' in the observation would be east. But the wall is 3 steps east (right), and the box is 2 steps east (right). That would mean the box is east of the agent, between the agent and the wall. So the agent can move east (right) 2 steps to reach the box. But how does that interact with the forward direction? 

Alternatively, the agent needs to turn right to face the direction where the box is, then move forward. But given the current observation, after turning right, the box is 2 steps in that direction. So perhaps the agent should turn right again to face south (if initially facing north), but then the wall is 3 steps right (east). Hmm, this is confusing. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent is facing a direction where their right is towards the box. For example, if the agent is facing north, and turns right (east), then their forward direction is east, right is south, left is west. The observation says the box is 2 steps right (south). So to reach the box, the agent would need to turn south (which is their right after turning right from north), but that might not be possible. 

Alternatively, perhaps the agent should first turn right to face east, then move forward towards the wall, but the box is south of the agent. This is getting too tangled. 

Maybe the simplest solution is to turn right to align with the box's direction and then move forward. But according to the current observation, the box is 2 steps right. So if the agent turns right, their new forward direction is south (assuming they were facing north), and the box is 2 steps in their new right direction (west). That doesn't make sense. 

Wait, perhaps the agent needs to turn left instead. If the agent turns left, their forward direction becomes west, and right becomes south. The box is 2 steps right (south). So turning left and then moving forward towards south would lead them to the box. But the observation mentions the wall is 3 steps right (south). So the box is 2 steps south, and the wall is 3 steps south. That would mean the path is blocked by the wall after 3 steps. But the box is only 2 steps south. So that's possible. So the agent could turn left, then move forward twice to reach the box. 

But how do we know the agent's current facing direction? Let's look at the previous actions. The initial observation had a wall 4 steps forward and a wall 1 step left. The agent turned right, then went forward. After that, the next observation had a wall 6 steps forward, a wall 3 steps right, and the box 2 steps right and 1 step forward. Then the agent went forward. Now, the current observation has the box 2 steps right and a wall 5 steps forward. 

Assuming that after turning right and moving forward twice, the agent's facing direction is such that their forward is now east, and the box is 2 steps east (right). But there's a wall 5 steps east (forward). Wait, that can't be. If the agent is facing east, then forward is east, right is south. The current observation says the box is 2 steps right (south), which would be behind them. That doesn't make sense. 

This is really confusing. Maybe the key is to focus on the current observation: purple box is 2 steps right. The agent needs to move in the direction of right to get to the box. So the action should be to turn right and then move forward. But if turning right aligns the agent to face the correct direction, then moving forward would reduce the distance. 

Alternatively, if the agent is already facing the correct direction, then moving forward would be the action. But according to the observation, the box is 2 steps right. So if the agent is facing the direction where right is towards the box, then moving forward would get them closer. 

Alternatively, perhaps the agent needs to turn right to align their forward direction with the box's location. For example, if the agent was facing north, and the box is to the east (2 steps right), then turning right (east) and moving forward twice would reach the box. But the observation mentions a wall 5 steps forward (east), which would block the path. That doesn't make sense. 

Wait, maybe the walls are in different directions. Let's recap the observations:

First observation: wall 4 forward, wall 1 left.

Agent turns right, then goes forward.

Second observation: wall 6 forward, wall 3 right, box 2 right and 1 forward.

Agent goes forward.

Third observation: wall 5 forward, box 2 right.

So after the agent turned right and moved forward twice, they are now in a position where forward is blocked by a wall (5 steps), and the box is 2 steps to the right. 

Assuming that after turning right, the agent's forward direction is east, and right is south. The box is 2 steps south (right), which is behind the agent. But there's a wall 5 steps east (forward). So the agent can't move east, but the box is south. To get to the box, the agent would need to turn south (which is their right), then move forward. But the observation says there's a wall 3 steps right (south). So the box is 2 steps south, and the wall is 3 steps south. That would mean the path is clear to 2 steps. So the agent can turn right (south), then move forward twice to reach the box. 

But how did the wall get to be 3 steps right (south)? After the agent turned right and moved forward, their new forward is east, right is south. The wall 3 steps right (south) would be in that direction. The box is 2 steps right (south), so it's between the agent and the wall. 

So the correct action would be to turn right (to face south), then move forward twice. But the current observation only requires the box to be 2 steps right. So after turning right, moving forward once would get the agent adjacent to the box (since it's 2 steps away and they move one step each time). Then, they can pick it up. 

But the agent's current observation only mentions the box is 2 steps right, not forward. So if the agent turns right, their 'right' becomes south, and the box is 2 steps in that direction. So turning right, then moving forward would get them closer. 

Therefore, the correct action is to turn right, then go forward. But the agent needs to decide between turning right or moving forward. 

Wait, the current observation says the box is 2 steps right. So if the agent turns right, their new forward direction is south, and the box is 2 steps in their new right direction (which would be west). That doesn't make sense. 

Alternatively, if the agent is facing north, turns right to face east, moves forward twice, then their new position has a wall 5 steps east (forward), a wall 3 steps south (right), and a box 2 steps south (right). Wait, that would mean the box is south of their new position. So to reach the box, they need to turn south (right turn from east facing), then move forward twice. 

In that case, the agent should turn right (from east facing, turning right would face south), then move forward twice. 

But how does the agent know their current facing direction? The previous actions: turned right once, moved forward twice. So initial direction: let's assume north. Turn right: east. Move forward twice: now at position where forward is east, right is south. Observation shows wall 5 east (forward), wall 3 south (right), and box 2 south (right). So to reach the box, turn right (south), move forward twice. 

Thus, the correct action is to turn right, then go forward. But the agent needs to first turn right. 

In the current observation, the agent sees the box 2 steps right. If they turn right, their new forward direction is south, and the box is 2 steps in their new right direction (west), which doesn't align. So perhaps the agent should turn left instead. 

If the agent is facing east, turning left would face north. Then, their right would be west. The box is 2 steps right (west). So turning left, then moving forward would not help. 

This is getting too confusing. Maybe the best approach is to turn right to face the direction where the box is, then move forward. But based on the current observation, after turning right, the box is 2 steps in that direction. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent is facing a direction where their right is towards the box. For example, if they turned right twice, facing south, then the box is 2 steps east (right). But this is speculative. 

Given the ambiguity, the safest action is to turn right to realign with the box's direction and then move forward. So the chosen action is go forward. Wait, but the agent is not adjacent to the box yet. The box is 2 steps away. So moving forward once would reduce it to 1 step. Then toggle or pick up. But the agent needs to be adjacent. 

Alternatively, the agent should turn right to face the correct direction, then go forward twice. But how to determine the correct direction. 

Another angle: the agent's goal is to get to the purple box. The box is 2 steps to the right. The action to get closer would be to move in the direction of right. But how is 'right' defined? If the agent is facing","

Let's see. The problem here is that the user tried to get to the purple box but kept failing because their actions weren't valid based on the current observation. Let me break down what's going on here.

First, looking at the latest observation provided: ""a wall 4 steps forward"" and ""a wall 3 steps right."" So the agent is facing a situation where directly ahead there's a wall four steps away, and to the right, another wall three steps away. The previous action was ""go forward,"" which must have hit the wall, causing the failure. The user then defaulted to ""go forward"" again, but that's not going to work here.

The agent needs to navigate around the walls to reach the purple box. The previous observations mentioned the purple box's location relative to the agent. Let me check the earlier observations to reconstruct the path. 

In the first observation, there was a wall four steps forward and one step left. The agent turned right, which probably changed their direction to face away from the initial wall. Then, the next observation had a wall six steps forward, a wall three steps right, and the purple box two steps right and one step forward. The agent decided to go forward, which might have moved them closer, but then the next observation showed the wall five steps forward and the purple box two steps right. The agent tried ""go forward"" again but hit the wall, leading to failure.

Now, in the current observation, the agent is facing a wall four steps ahead and a wall three steps to the right. They need to find another direction to proceed. Since they can't go forward or right (both have walls), turning left might be the only viable option. Turning left would change their direction, allowing them to move away from the wall in front and perhaps towards the purple box's location. 

The purple box was previously located two steps right and one step forward. If the agent turns left, their new direction would be perpendicular to the wall in front. Moving forward in that new direction might take them closer to the purple box, avoiding the walls. Alternatively, after turning left, they could check if there's a path forward that wasn't blocked before. 

However, without knowing the exact layout of the environment, the safest bet is to turn left to avoid the immediate walls and then attempt to move forward in the new direction. This could potentially lead them towards the purple box's location. 

Another possibility is that the agent might need to toggle or interact with something, but given the current observation with only walls, interaction isn't feasible. The key is to avoid walls and maneuver towards the target. 

So, the best action here is to ""turn left"" to change direction and then move forward in the new path. That should help the agent bypass the walls and continue towards the purple box.

Let's see where I am. The current observation says there's a wall 4 steps forward and another wall 3 steps left. The previous observations showed a purple box somewhere, but now it's not mentioned. Maybe I went past it or it's blocked.

Wait, in the last few steps, after turning left, I saw a wall 4 forward and 3 left. The purple box was previously two steps right and one forward, then after moving forward, the wall came closer, and then the box was two steps right. But now, the box isn't in the current observation. So maybe I need to navigate around the walls to find it again.

The available actions are turn left, turn right, go forward, pick up, drop, toggle. Since there's a wall directly ahead and another to the left, going forward isn't an option. If I turn left, there's a wall 3 steps to the left, which might not help. Turning right could let me move in a direction where the purple box might be. Let me check the previous path. 

Previously, I turned right to face a different direction. Maybe I need to turn right again to head away from the wall on the left and possibly toward the purple box. Alternatively, turning around (180 degrees) could help. But since the last action was turn left, turning right again might make me face a new direction. Let me think: if I turn right, then the wall to the left is now behind me, and the wall forward is still ahead. Wait, no, the wall forward is 4 steps regardless of direction. Maybe I need to reorient myself.

Another approach: since the box wasn't in the last observation, perhaps I need to backtrack or explore other directions. But going back isn't possible if there's a wall ahead. Alternatively, toggle might be useful, but there's no object mentioned to toggle. Pick up and drop don't make sense here unless I'm holding something, but the previous actions didn't involve picking up anything yet.

So the best bet is to change direction. Since turning right would face a new direction where there might be less obstruction. Let me try turning right again. But wait, the current walls are forward and left. If I turn right, my new forward direction would be where the left wall was, and the right would be a new area. Maybe that's the way to go. Alternatively, turning left again would face the wall on the left, which isn't helpful. So probably turn right to explore a new path.

Let's see what's happening here. The current observation says there's a wall 4 steps forward and a wall 3 steps to the right. The goal is to get to the purple box, but I can't see it in the latest observation. Did the purple box move or get picked up earlier?

In the previous steps, the user had to navigate around walls. The last action was turning right, and the current observation still has walls in front and to the right. Since there's no mention of the purple box now, maybe I need to check if it's out of sight or if I need to adjust my path. But the immediate problem here is that all possible forward and right movements are blocked by walls. 

The available actions are turn left, turn right, go forward, pick up, drop, toggle. Since going forward or right is against a wall, those aren't options. Turning left or right might change the direction, allowing me to potentially find a path. But based on the current observation, turning either way might just hit another wall. Wait, the walls are 4 steps forward and 3 steps right. If I turn left, maybe the wall to the right (which is now in front after turning) could be navigated around? Let me visualize this.

If I'm facing a wall 4 steps ahead and a wall 3 steps to the right. Let's assume my initial direction is north. So, walls north, east (3 steps), and if I turn left (west), maybe there's a path there. But the observation doesn't mention a wall to the left. Wait, the current observation only lists walls forward and right. The other directions (left, backward) aren't mentioned, so they might be clear. 

So, possible actions: turn left or right. If I turn left (west), then my forward direction would be west, and the right would be south. Since there's no wall mentioned in those directions, maybe I can proceed there. Alternatively, turning right (south) would have a wall 3 steps right (which is east relative to the new direction). But the observation says a wall 3 steps right, which was originally east when facing north. If I turn right to face south, then the right direction is east again, which still has a wall 3 steps east. So turning right doesn't help. 

Therefore, turning left (west) might open up a path. Let's check: after turning left, the forward direction is west, and the right is south. Since there's no wall mentioned in those directions except the original forward (north) wall. So moving forward after turning left could be possible. 

But wait, the previous actions had the agent moving forward when the purple box was in sight. Now that the purple box isn't in the current observation, maybe it's behind a wall or the agent needs to backtrack. However, the agent can't go backward because that direction isn't mentioned, but it's possible. 

Alternatively, maybe the purple box was picked up earlier. But in the previous observations, the agent was trying to get to it by moving right and forward. If the purple box was picked up, the observation would mention it being held. So it's likely still in the environment. 

Given the current walls, the only viable actions are turning left or right. Since turning right leads to a wall, turning left might be the way to go. The agent needs to explore new directions to locate the purple box again. Let's choose to turn left to change direction and possibly find a path towards the purple box.

Let me try to figure out the next move here. The current observation is that there's a wall 4 steps forward and another wall 3 steps left. From the previous interactions, the agent has been turning left and right to navigate around walls, but the goal is to get to the purple box.

Wait, looking back, the last successful action was moving forward when the purple box was in sight. But now, after some turns, the agent is facing walls both forward and to the left. The purple box's location isn't directly mentioned in the latest observation, so maybe the agent needs to reorient itself.

In the previous steps, the agent tried turning left, then right, left again, etc. But if the walls are consistently on those sides, maybe the agent needs to move in a different direction. Since going forward is blocked by a wall, turning right might be the only option that could lead away from the wall. Let me check the prior steps: the agent turned right when there were walls ahead and to the right, then left again. But now, the walls are forward and left. If the agent turns right, that would face a direction where there might not be a wall, perhaps leading towards the purple box.

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to backtrack or try a different path. But how? If turning right is an option, that might open up a path. The key is to avoid getting stuck in a loop of turning left and right without progress. The agent's past actions show that repeating the same turns isn't working, so switching direction might be necessary.

So the best action here, given the walls forward and left, is to turn right. That should change the agent's facing direction, possibly creating a path to move forward towards the purple box.

Let's see where I am. The current observation says there's a wall 4 steps forward and a wall 3 steps to the right. From the previous interactions, I remember turning right and left multiple times. The goal is the purple box, which I think I saw earlier in a different observation. But right now, the walls are blocking my forward and right paths.

In the earlier steps, when the purple box was 2 steps right and 1 forward, I went forward once. Then, after moving, the purple box was 2 steps right, but the forward path had a wall. Then I tried turning left, which might have aligned me towards the box, but the observation after that showed walls again. The system default action got me to a spot with walls in front and right. Now, again, walls are in front and right. 

I need to navigate around these walls. Since turning left or right doesn't change the relative positions if the walls are still there, maybe I should keep alternating directions. Alternatively, perhaps I need to move in a different pattern. But moving forward is blocked by a wall. So the possible actions are turn left, turn right, or toggle, but toggle doesn't make sense here. So between turning left or right. Since the walls are in the same positions, maybe turning left twice would change direction. Let me think: if I'm facing a wall forward and another wall to the right, turning right would face me away from the forward wall, but the right wall is still there. Wait, maybe my orientation changed. Let me visualize. Suppose I'm facing north. The wall to the right would be east. But if I turn right (to face east), then the wall 3 steps right would now be south? No, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe the agent's directions are relative. Hmm, perhaps I need to try turning left to face a different direction where the path is clear. But in the current observation, both forward and right have walls. So turning left or right might not help. Wait, but maybe the agent's previous direction affects this. Let's track the history. 

Earlier, after some turns, the agent ended up facing a direction where forward had a wall and right had a wall. If I turn left from that position, maybe the forward path becomes clear. Or perhaps I need to go back. But there's no backward action; only go forward. So the only options are turning and moving forward. Since moving forward is blocked, the only options are turning. But turning left or right might just cycle between the same walls. Wait, in the previous steps, after turning right, the walls' positions changed? Let me check. For example, in one observation after turning right, the walls were 4 steps forward and 3 steps left. So the direction affects the positions. So if I keep alternating turns, the walls' relative positions change. 

So maybe the strategy is to keep turning left or right to find a path where the forward direction isn't blocked. But how to decide which way? Since the purple box's position isn't in the current observation, maybe I have to circle around the walls to find it again. Alternatively, perhaps I need to move in a square pattern. 

Given that moving forward is blocked, the best action is to turn left or right. Let's try turning left first. If I turn left, then the forward path might now be clear. But in the previous steps, turning left led to different wall positions. Alternatively, turning right might lead to a different direction. Since the current observation has walls in front and right, turning left would face me north-west or something, but without knowing the exact direction, it's hard. But based on prior interactions, the agent alternated turning right and left to navigate around. 

So perhaps the next action is to turn left again. Alternatively, the system's default might have been to go forward, which failed, so now the agent needs to adjust direction. Since the walls are still in the same positions, maybe the agent is in a loop. To break the loop, the agent should consistently turn in one direction. For example, always turn right when stuck. That way, the agent starts to move in a spiral around the obstacle. 

In the previous steps, the agent turned right when facing walls, leading to different wall positions. So maybe turning right again here would change the relative directions of the walls. Let me try that. So the chosen action would be turn right.

The goal is to get to the purple box. Let me look at the current observation.

The sensors show a wall 3 steps forward and a wall 3 steps to the right. The purple box is 1 step right and 2 steps forward. Hmm, so from my current position, if I go forward twice, that would take me past the wall? Wait, no. The wall is 3 steps forward, so maybe I need to adjust my direction.

Wait, the box is 1 step right and 2 forward. So if I'm facing a certain direction, maybe I need to turn left to face the right direction. Let me think. Suppose I'm facing north. The wall is 3 steps north, and to the east (right) is a wall 3 steps. The box is 1 east and 2 north. But if I'm facing north, going forward would hit the wall after 3 steps. But the box is 2 steps forward and 1 right. So maybe I need to turn left to face east? Then go right once (but there's a wall 3 steps right from the original position). Wait, no. Wait, after turning left, facing east. The wall is 3 steps to the east. But the box is 1 step east and 2 steps north. So from the current position, if I turn left (east), then go right once (but there's a wall 3 steps east, so maybe that's not possible). Alternatively, maybe I need to face a different direction.

Wait, maybe my initial direction is different. Let me try to sketch this mentally. Let's assume I'm facing north. The walls are 3 steps north and 3 steps east. The box is 1 east and 2 north. So from current position, to reach the box, I need to go east 1 and north 2. But if I face north, going forward twice would get me north 2, but then I need to go east 1. But the wall is 3 steps east, which would be the same direction. Wait, perhaps there's a different path. Maybe I need to turn right instead. If I turn right (face east), then go forward once, but the wall is 3 steps east. That seems conflicting. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.

Alternatively, maybe I'm facing a different initial direction. Let's say I'm facing south. Then the wall is 3 steps south and 3 steps left (since left would be west). The box is 1 step right (east) and 2 steps forward (north). So from the current position, if I turn left (west), but there's a wall 3 steps west. That's not helpful. If I turn right (east), then go forward once to east 1, but wall is 3 steps east. Hmm. Maybe another approach.

Wait, the box is 1 right and 2 forward. Let's consider the relative position. If the box is northeast of my current position, then perhaps I need to face northeast? But since the actions only allow turning left or right (90-degree turns), maybe I need to adjust direction step by step.

Alternatively, maybe I should first move forward as much as possible before turning. But the wall is 3 steps forward. So going forward would hit the wall. So that's not possible. So perhaps I need to turn left or right to avoid the wall and then move towards the box.

If I turn left (assuming initial facing north), then face east. The wall is 3 steps east. So going right (east) once would hit the wall. That's not good. If I turn right (initial facing north), face south. Then the wall is 3 steps south. The box is 2 steps forward (north) from current position. Wait, if I'm facing south, going forward would be into the wall. That's bad. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the initial direction is different. Let me try another assumption. Suppose I'm facing east. The wall is 3 steps forward (east) and 3 steps right (south). The box is 1 step right (south) and 2 steps forward (east). So to get to the box, I need to go east 2 and south 1. But facing east, going forward twice would reach the wall at 3 steps. So that's not possible. Then, maybe turn left (face north), go forward 2 steps (but the wall is 3 steps forward, so after 2 steps, that's safe), then turn right (face east again), but then the wall is 3 steps east. Wait, no, after turning north and moving forward 2, then facing east again, the wall is 3 steps east from the original position. But from the new position, how far is the wall? Maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, let's think of coordinates. Let's set the current position as (0,0). If the wall is 3 steps forward, say in the positive y-direction, then (0,3) is a wall. The wall to the right would be in the positive x-direction at (3,0). The purple box is at (1,2). So to get from (0,0) to (1,2), the path would require moving east 1 and north 2. But there's a wall at (3,0) (east) and at (0,3) (north). So how?

If the agent is facing north initially, moving forward would hit the wall at (0,3). So can't go north. Need to turn. If turn left (face east), but wall at (3,0). So moving east would hit the wall. If turn right (face south), wall at (0, -3), but that's not the case here. Wait, maybe the coordinates are different. Alternatively, maybe the walls are in the direction the agent is facing.

Alternatively, maybe the agent is facing a direction where forward is towards north, right is east. So walls are 3 steps forward (north) and 3 steps right (east). The box is 1 east and 2 north. So from (0,0), the box is at (1,2). To get there, need to move east 1 and north 2. But moving north is blocked by a wall 3 steps away. So the agent must find a path around.

But how? Since moving north directly is blocked, the agent needs to turn left or right to navigate around. For example, turn left (face east), but east is blocked. Turn right (face south), then go forward, but then how to get back north? Maybe turn around.

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to go forward some steps, then turn. But given the walls, perhaps the only way is to turn left or right and then move.

Wait, the agent is at (0,0). Walls at (0,3) forward (north) and (3,0) right (east). Box at (1,2). So possible path: Turn left (face east), but can't go east because wall at (3,0). So turn right (face south), go forward, but that moves away from the box. Then turn left (face east again), but still blocked. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to move forward a bit, then turn. Wait, but moving forward from (0,0) north would hit the wall at (0,3). So can't move forward north. If the agent turns right (south), then moves forward, but that's not helpful. Then turn left (east), but east is blocked. This seems like a dead end. But the box is at (1,2), so how to reach it?

Wait, maybe the agent is not facing north. Suppose the agent is facing west. Then walls are 3 steps forward (west) at (-3,0) and 3 steps right (south) at (0,-3). The box is 1 step right (east) and 2 steps forward (west). So the box would be at (-2,1)? That doesn't align. Maybe I'm mixing up directions.

This is getting complicated. Maybe I need to think in terms of the agent's current facing direction. Let's assume the agent is facing north. The wall is 3 steps north and 3 steps east. The box is 1 east and 2 north. So from current position, to reach the box, the agent needs to go east 1 and north 2. But moving east is blocked by a wall 3 steps east. So how?

Alternatively, maybe the agent can't go straight east, so needs to find another path. For example, move forward north once (but wall is 3 steps north, so moving once is okay), then turn east? Wait, after moving forward once, the agent is at (0,1). Now, walls are 2 steps north (to (0,3)) and still 3 steps east. The box is at (1,2). From (0,1), the agent can turn right (face east), but east is blocked. Or turn left (face west), which is also blocked by the wall 3 steps forward (west). Hmm. Not helpful.

Wait, another approach. The agent needs to reach (1,2). The walls are at (0,3) north and (3,0) east. So the only way is to go around the walls. For example, go south, then east, then north. But how?

If the agent turns right (face south), moves forward. Now at (0,-1). Then turn right again (face west), but the wall is 3 steps forward (west). So moving west would hit the wall. Not good. Alternatively, from (0,-1), turn left (face east). No wall there, so move east 1 step to (1,-1). Then turn north (by turning left again), and move forward 3 steps to (1,2). But wait, moving north from (1,-1) would take the agent to (1,2), which is the box! But how many steps? The agent needs to move 3 steps north from (1,-1) to reach (1,2). But the observation says the wall is 3 steps forward when facing north initially. But after moving and turning, the walls might be in different positions.

Wait, but in the current observation, the walls are 3 steps forward and 3 steps right regardless of direction. Because the observation is given from the agent's current perspective. So when the agent turns, their forward and right directions change.

So in the current observation, regardless of facing direction, the agent sees a wall 3 steps forward and 3 steps right. The box is 1 step right and 2 steps forward. So the agent's current facing direction must be such that their forward is aligned with the direction where the wall is 3 steps away, and right is another direction with a wall 3 steps.

But the box is in a position that is 1 step right and 2 steps forward from the agent's current position. So relative to the agent's current direction:

- If the agent is facing north:

  - Forward is north, right is east.

  - Wall is 3 north, 3 east.

  - Box is 1 east (right) and 2 north (forward).

  - So to reach the box, the agent needs to go east 1 and north 2. But east is blocked by a wall beyond 3 steps. So can't go east directly.

- If the agent is facing east:

  - Forward is east, right is south.

  - Wall is 3 east, 3 south.

  - Box is 1 south (right) and 2 east (forward).

  - So need to go east 2 and south 1. But east is blocked after 3 steps. So can't go east.

- If facing south:

  - Forward is south, right is west.

  - Wall 3 south, 3 west.

  - Box is 1 west (right) and 2 south (forward).

  - Can't go south beyond 3 steps.

- If facing west:

  - Forward is west, right is north.

  - Wall 3 west, 3 north.

  - Box is 1 north (right) and 2 west (forward).

  - Can't go west beyond 3 steps.

Hmm, this is confusing. Because regardless of the facing direction, the walls are 3 steps in forward and right. The box is always 1 right and 2 forward. So the agent is in a position where moving straight forward twice would get them close, but then they need to turn right to get to the box. But the wall is 3 steps forward, so moving forward twice is possible (since it's less than 3), but after that, turning right would face a direction where the wall is also 3 steps. But the box is in the direction that is right and forward from the original position.

Wait, maybe the agent needs to move forward twice, then turn right, and then move once. Let's think:

Original position: facing north.

- Move forward twice: reaches (0,2). Now, walls are still 3 steps forward (north to (0,3)) and 3 steps right (east to (3,0)).

- Turn right (face south).

- Move forward once: reaches (0,1). Now, south is clear (since wall is 3 steps forward from original position, but now facing south, the wall is at (0,-3), which is beyond current position).

- Turn right again (face west).

- Move forward once: reaches (-1,1). But the box is at (1,2), so this isn't helpful.

Alternatively, after moving forward twice to (0,2), turn left (face east).

- Move forward once: but east wall is at (3,0), so can't go beyond that. So this path is blocked.

Hmm. Another approach: The box is 1 right and 2 forward. So from the agent's current position, if they can turn right, then move forward 2, then turn right again, and move 1. But need to check if that's possible.

For example:

- Current facing: north.

- Turn right (face south).

- Move forward 2: reaches (0,-2). But this is moving away from the box.

- Turn right again (face west).

- Move forward 1: reaches (-1,-2). Not helpful.

Alternatively, turn left (face east), move forward 1 (but wall is at 3 east), so can't.

This is tricky. Maybe the agent needs to adjust their direction first. Let's try:

1. Turn right (face south).

2. Move forward until you can't (but wall is 3 steps south, so move forward 3 steps? But that would hit the wall. So can't.

Alternatively, turn right (face south), move forward once, then turn left (face east).

Now, facing east, can the agent move forward? The wall is 3 steps east from original position, so from (0,-1), moving east would be okay for up to 3 steps. So move east 1 step to (1,-1).

Then turn left (face north).

Move forward 2 steps to (1,1). Then move forward once more to (1,2), which is the box.

Yes! That seems like a possible path.

So the steps would be:

- Turn right (south).

- Go forward once (now at (0,-1)).

- Turn left (east).

- Go forward once (now at (1,-1)).

- Turn left (north).

- Go forward twice (now at (1,2)).

But the problem is the agent needs to do this in the current observation. Let's see what the current observation says.

Current Observation:

a wall 3 steps forward

a wall 3 steps right

a purple box 1 step right and 2 steps forward

So the agent is facing a direction where forward is blocked after 3 steps, right is blocked after 3 steps, and the box is 1 right and 2 forward.

Following the path I thought:

First action: turn right.

Then, go forward once (since after turning right, forward is south, and the wall is 3 steps in that direction. So moving once is allowed).

Next, turn left (now facing east).

Go forward once (east 1 step).

Turn left again (now facing north).

Go forward twice (north 2 steps), reaching the box.

So the actions would be: turn right, go forward, turn left, go forward, turn left, go forward, go forward.

But the agent needs to do this in the current step. However, the user is asking for the next action based on the current observation.

In the current observation, the agent sees the box 1 right and 2 forward. So the agent is likely facing a direction where forward is towards the direction of the box's two steps, and right is towards the box's one step.

Wait, if the box is 1 right and 2 forward, then the agent is facing a direction where forward is the direction to go 2 steps towards the box, and right is the direction to go 1 step towards the box. So the agent's current facing direction must be such that their forward is aligned with the direction of the box's two steps, and right is aligned with the box's one step.

For example, if the agent is facing north:

- Forward is north (box is 2 north), right is east (box is 1 east).

But the wall is 3 steps forward (north) and 3 steps right (east). So moving forward north 2 steps would get to the box's y-coordinate, but the agent needs to also move east 1. However, moving east is blocked by the wall.

Alternatively, if the agent is facing northeast, but the actions only allow 90-degree turns. So that's not possible.

Wait, maybe the agent needs to first move forward two steps, then turn right to face east, but east is blocked. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, the agent could move forward two steps, then turn left (west), but that's also blocked.

Hmm. This is really confusing. Maybe the correct action here is to move forward twice, but the wall is only 3 steps forward, so moving two steps is possible. Then, turn right and move once. But since the wall is 3 steps right in the original direction, after moving forward, the right direction might have changed.

Wait, let's try:

Current facing: north.

Box is 1 east and 2 north.

Agent moves forward twice: reaches (0,2).

Now, walls are still 3 steps forward (north to (0,3)) and 3 steps right (east to (3,0)).

Now, turn right (face south).

Go forward once: reaches (0,1).

Now, right is west (since facing south).

Wall is 3 steps forward (south to (0,-3)), but agent is at (0,1).

Turn left (face east).

Now, right is south.

Go forward once: reaches (1,1).

Now, facing east, wall is 3 steps east (to (4,1)).

But the box is at (1,2). So from (1,1),","

Let's see where I need to go. The goal is to get to the purple box. The current observation says there's a wall 2 steps forward and a wall 3 steps to the right. The purple box is 1 step right and 1 step forward.

First, I need to figure out my current direction. The previous actions were turn left, turn right, and so on. But since the observations don't mention direction, maybe I should assume my starting direction. Let's say I was facing north initially. If I turned right a few times, maybe I'm facing east now.

Looking at the map in my mind, if the wall is 2 steps forward (north) and a wall 3 steps right (east), then the purple box is 1 east and 1 north. Wait, that doesn't make sense if the wall is directly north. Wait, the current observation says the purple box is 1 step right and 1 step forward. So if I'm facing north, right would be east. So the box is to the east and north of me. But there's a wall 2 steps forward (north), so I can't go straight north. The box is north-east, but north is blocked. Therefore, I need to go around the wall.

Alternatively, maybe I need to adjust my direction. Let's see. If I'm facing north, walls to the north (2 steps) and east (3 steps). The box is east 1 and north 1. But north is blocked, so I need to go east first, then north? But east is blocked. Wait, the wall is 3 steps east. So if I go east now, I hit a wall. Hmm. Then maybe I need to turn left, so that east becomes south. Wait, if I turn left from facing north, I'm facing west. Then, east would be south. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused with directions.

Let me try to visualize the movement. Suppose I'm facing north. Walls are north (2 steps), east (3 steps). Purple box is east 1 and north 1. But north is blocked. So to reach the box, I need to go east first, but east is blocked. That can't be. So maybe my current direction is different.

Alternatively, if I'm facing east. Then, forward would be east, left would be north, right would be south. The wall is 3 steps forward (east), 3 steps right (south). The box is 1 east and 1 forward. Wait, that would be 1 step further east, which is blocked by the wall. So that doesn't make sense either.

Hmm. Let's try another approach. The purple box is 1 step right and 1 step forward from my current position. So relative to me, the box is diagonally ahead to the right. My current direction must be such that moving forward and right leads to the box. Let's say I'm facing north. Then right is east. So the box is northeast. But forward (north) is blocked. So I can't go north. So I need to go east first, but east is blocked (wall 3 steps right). So how?

Alternatively, maybe I turned right from north, making me face east. Then forward is east (wall 3 steps), right is south. The box is 1 right (south) and 1 forward (east). But my forward is blocked. So I can't go east. So I need to go south. If I turn right again (now facing south), then forward would be south. Then I can go south, then turn around to face north, but then the wall is 2 steps forward. Wait, this is getting complicated.

Wait, in the current observation, after the last default action of go forward, which led to the observation where the wall is 2 steps forward, 3 steps right, and the box is 1 right and 1 forward. So let's think about the previous steps. The previous action was 'turn left' leading to the observation where walls are 4 steps forward and 3 steps left, then 'turn right' leading to walls 4 steps forward and 3 steps right, etc. Maybe the agent got stuck in a loop turning left and right without making progress.

Now, in the latest observation, the purple box is 1 step right and 1 step forward. So the agent needs to move in that direction. But the wall is 2 steps forward. So if the agent moves forward once, they would hit the wall. Therefore, they need to adjust their direction to approach the box without hitting the wall.

Perhaps the agent should first move right (east) to get past the wall. But the wall is 3 steps right. So if the agent turns right (south), then moves forward, that might clear the path. Wait, but in the current observation, after moving forward, the agent is facing a wall 2 steps forward. So maybe the agent needs to turn left (west) to avoid the wall?

Alternatively, since the box is 1 step right and 1 step forward, the agent needs to face a direction where moving forward and right leads to the box. If the agent is facing north, right is east, so they need to go east 1 and north 1. But north is blocked. So they have to go east first, but east is blocked. Therefore, the agent needs to adjust their direction. Maybe turn left to face west, then move west to get around the wall, then turn north, and then move north-east to reach the box. But this might be complicated.

Alternatively, the agent could turn south (right from facing north), move south until there's no wall, then turn east, then move east to the box. But the current observation says walls are 2 steps forward (north) and 3 steps right (east). If the agent turns south, then forward is south (no wall mentioned), so they can move south. Then turn east (now facing east), but the wall is still 3 steps east. So moving east would hit the wall. Hmm.

Wait, in the current observation, the purple box is 1 step right and 1 step forward. So if the agent turns left (west), then forward is west. But the wall is not mentioned in that direction. Then move west, then turn north, and then move north and east. But this is getting too speculative.

Alternatively, the agent can try to move forward 1 step, but the wall is 2 steps forward, so moving forward once would hit the wall. Therefore, the agent cannot move forward. So they need to move right (east) 1 step towards the box. But the wall is 3 steps east, so moving east once would be possible if there's no wall immediately. Wait, the observation says a wall 3 steps east, so moving 1 step east would not be a wall. Wait, no—the observation says ""a wall 3 steps right"", which if facing north, right is east. So 3 steps east is a wall. So moving 1 step east would be okay. Wait, but if there's a wall 3 steps east, it doesn't mean that every step east is blocked. It just means that 3 steps in that direction there's a wall. So moving 1 step east would be safe. Then, from there, the agent can move forward towards the box.

So the plan would be: turn right (to face east), move forward 1 step (now east 1), then turn north (left), move forward 1 step (now north 1, which is the box's position). But the box is 1 step right and 1 forward. So if facing east, moving forward 1 (east), then turning north (left) and moving forward 1 (north) would reach the box. Then pick it up.

But in the current observation, the agent is facing a direction where forward is blocked (2 steps), and right is blocked (3 steps). So maybe the agent needs to turn left to face west, then move forward until there's no wall, then adjust direction. But this is getting complex.

Alternatively, the agent could try to move right (east) 1 step, even though the wall is 3 steps east. Wait, the wall is 3 steps east, but the box is 1 step east and 1 forward. So moving east 1 step would place the agent at the position where the box is east and forward. Then moving forward would reach the box.

So the correct actions would be: turn right (to face east), go forward 1 step (now at east 1), then turn left (to face north), go forward 1 step (now at north 1, which is the box's position), then pick up.

But in the current observation, after the last default action (go forward), the agent is facing a wall 2 steps forward and the box is 1 right, 1 forward. So the agent is likely facing north, with the wall 2 steps north and the box northeast. So to get there, the agent needs to go east first, then north.

Therefore, the correct action now is to turn right (to face east), then go forward. But since the box is 1 step right and 1 forward, turning right and moving forward once would get the agent to the east 1 position, then they need to turn left (north) and move forward to reach the box. But in the current step, the agent needs to choose the next action. The immediate next action after the current observation would be to turn right to face east, then go forward.

But the agent's current observation is: wall 2 steps forward, wall 3 steps right, purple box 1 right and 1 forward. So if the agent turns right (now facing east), the wall is 3 steps right (south?), wait, directions are confusing.

Wait, when facing north, right is east. So if the agent turns right, they face east. The wall 3 steps right (east) is 3 steps in the east direction. So moving east once would be okay. Then, from there, facing east, the agent can move forward, then turn north (left) and move forward to reach the box.

So the next action should be turn right to face east, then go forward. But the agent needs to output the next action. Given that the box is 1 step right and 1 forward, and the current direction is such that forward is blocked, the agent must first adjust direction.

Therefore, the correct action now is to turn right, then go forward. However, the agent needs to output a single action. So first, they need to turn right to face east. Then, go forward. So the immediate action should be turn right, because turning right allows them to move east towards the box.

Alternatively, maybe the agent should first move forward as much as possible, but since forward is blocked, turning is necessary.

Yes, the agent should turn right to face east, allowing them to move towards the box's position. So the next action is turn right.

a purple box 1 step left and 1 step forward",0,False
10,turn left,"<reasoning>
Let's try to figure out the next action here. The current observation shows a wall 3 steps forward, a wall 2 steps left, and the purple box is 1 step left and 1 step forward. The agent's goal is to get to the purple box.

First, I need to map out the agent's current direction and position. Since the walls are in specific directions, maybe the agent is facing north. The wall 3 steps forward would be in the direction the agent is currently facing. The wall 2 steps left suggests that if the agent turns left (which would be west, if they were facing north), there's a wall there.

The purple box is 1 step left and 1 step forward. So, if the agent is facing north, left would be west and forward is north. Therefore, the box is 1 step west and 1 step north from the current position. 

But there's a wall 3 steps north (forward) and a wall 2 steps west (left). So the agent can't go straight north three steps because there's a wall. They also can't go west two steps because of the wall. The box is one step west and one step north, but the agent can't go north past the wall. 

So, maybe the agent needs to adjust their direction. Let's think: if the agent turns right (east), then forward steps would be east. But the wall to the left (west) is 2 steps, but that's already a wall. If the agent turns right, maybe they can navigate around the walls. 

Alternatively, since the box is 1 step left and 1 step forward, but forward is blocked by a wall three steps away, perhaps the agent first needs to go left (west) one step, but that's blocked by a wall two steps left. Wait, the wall is 2 steps left. So moving left once would be one step left (west), which is possible. Then, after moving left once, the agent could face west and then move forward to get to the box? But wait, the box is 1 step left and 1 step forward from the original position. So moving left once would put the agent at a position where the box is 1 step forward from there. But the original observation says the box is 1 step left and 1 step forward, so from the original position, moving left once (to the west) and then forward once (to the north) would reach the box. But the problem is that moving forward from the original position is blocked by a wall three steps away. However, after moving left once, the forward direction would be north, but is there still a wall there? The original observation only mentions a wall 3 steps forward (north) from the starting position. If the agent moves left once, their new position's forward direction (north) might now have different obstacles. Wait, but the observation provided is from the current state, which includes the walls as they are in this moment. The agent's current position might have different walls depending on where they are. 

Wait, maybe the initial observation after moving left once would change. But the problem is that in the current observation given, the walls are 3 steps forward and 2 steps left. So, the agent's current direction is such that forward is blocked by a wall three steps away, left is blocked two steps away. The box is 1 step left and 1 step forward. So, to reach the box, the agent needs to go left once and then forward once. But the problem is that moving left once would get past the wall that's two steps left? Wait, no. If the wall is two steps left from the current position, then moving left once would only be one step towards the wall, which is still possible. Then, from that new position, moving forward (which would be north) would take them to the box. However, the original observation states that there's a wall three steps forward. Does that mean that three steps in the forward direction (north) from the original position is a wall, but after moving left, the forward direction might not have a wall? Or does the wall three steps forward in the original observation still affect the agent's path after moving left?

This is a bit confusing. Let me try to visualize it. Let's assume the agent is facing north. Original position:

- Forward (north): wall at 3 steps.
- Left (west): wall at 2 steps.
- Purple box: 1 step west (left) and 1 step north (forward).

So, from the agent's current position, if they turn left (west), they can move west once, which is possible because the wall is two steps west. Then, from the new position (1 step west), moving forward (north) once would reach the box. But why is there a wall three steps north originally? Because in the original position, moving three steps north hits a wall. But after moving one step west, moving north would only be one step, which might not hit the wall. So perhaps the wall three steps forward is in the original direction, not considering the agent's movement. 

In that case, the correct path is: turn left (to face west), move forward once to get to the position one step west, then turn north (right from facing west) and move forward once to get to the box. Wait, but the agent's direction after turning left would be west. Moving forward once from west would take them towards west, not north. Oh, that's a mistake. If the agent turns left (west), then moving forward would be west. But the box is north and west from the original position. So after turning left (west), moving forward once gets them west one step. Then they need to move north, which would require turning north (right turn from west). So, after moving west once, turn right (north), then move forward once to reach the box. 

But how do we know the agent isn't facing the correct direction? The initial actions might involve turning to face the correct direction. Let's see the previous steps. In the history, the agent tried turning right, left, etc., but ended up in positions with walls. Now, in the current observation, after some movements, the walls are 3 steps forward, 2 steps left, and the box is 1 step left and 1 step forward. 

So the agent needs to adjust their direction. Let's think: the box is to the left (west) and forward (north) from the current position. If the agent can face a direction that allows them to go west and north, perhaps northwest? But the available actions are turn left, right, go forward, etc. 

Alternatively, the agent could turn left (west), move forward once (past the wall two steps west? Wait, the wall is two steps left from the original position, which would be two steps west. If the agent moves west once, they are one step west, which is still clear. Then, from there, turning north (by turning right) and moving forward would reach the box. 

But how does the agent know to do that? The action sequence would be: turn left (to face west), go forward once (to position 1 west), turn right (to face north), go forward once (to the box). 

But the current observation only gives the immediate surroundings. The agent must deduce the necessary steps. Given the current observation, the immediate action needed is to either turn left or right to face the correct direction. 

Looking at the current observation: walls 3 steps forward, 2 steps left, and the box 1 left and 1 forward. If the agent turns left (west), their new forward direction would be west. Moving forward once would get them to 1 west, which is clear. Then they need to face north to get to the box. So, from facing west, turning right (north) and then moving forward. 

But the agent's current observation doesn't mention the state after moving. So the agent has to reason based on the current observation. The immediate action to take could be to turn left to face west, then move forward once. But the agent can only take one action at a time. 

In the current observation, the agent's possible next actions are turn left, turn right, go forward (but that's blocked by a wall three steps away), pick up (nothing to pick up), drop (not holding anything), toggle (no object in front). 

So the valid actions are turn left, turn right, or go forward (but going forward is blocked three steps away, but maybe one step? Wait, the observation says a wall 3 steps forward. So moving one step forward would still be okay because it's not a wall immediately in front. Wait, no—the description says ""a wall 4 steps forward"" in an earlier observation. Wait, in the current observation, it's ""a wall 3 steps forward"". So moving one step forward would be possible, but after that, there's a wall two steps further. 

But the purple box is 1 step left and 1 step forward. So if the agent moves forward once, they would be one step closer to the box, but then they need to go left. However, after moving forward once, their new position would have the box at 1 step left and 0 steps forward (since they moved forward once). 

Alternatively, turning left (west) would allow them to move forward towards the box. 

So the best immediate action is to turn left to face west, then move forward once. But since the agent can only perform one action per turn, the first action should be to turn left. That way, the next action can be moving forward to get to the box's position west, then turn right to face north and move forward. 

But in the current observation, the agent needs to choose between turning left, right, or going forward. Going forward is possible (since the wall is three steps away, not immediately in front), but moving forward would put them one step closer, but then they still need to adjust direction. However, the box is diagonally one step left and forward. So moving forward once would make the box one step left, which would require turning left again. 

Alternatively, turning left now would set the agent up to move west towards the box's position. 

So the best action here is to turn left. That way, the agent can then move forward towards the box. 

Another possibility: the agent could turn right. If they turn right (east), their forward direction is east. But the wall is two steps left (west), which is not relevant in this direction. However, the box is west and north, so turning right wouldn't help. 

Therefore, the correct action is to turn left.

The agent needs to reach the purple box. The current observation says there's a wall 2 steps forward, a wall 3 steps right, and the purple box is 1 step right and 1 step forward.

So the agent's current direction must be such that moving forward would hit a wall in 2 steps. The purple box is to the right and one step forward. Let me visualize this. Maybe the agent is facing north, with the wall ahead two steps, a wall to the east (3 steps), and the box is to the east (1 step) and north (1 step). 

To get to the box, the agent needs to move right (east) once, then forward (north) once. But the observation mentions the purple box is 1 step right and 1 step forward. So the agent needs to first turn right to face east, move right once to get to the box's position, then move forward once. 

But in the previous steps, the agent was turning right and left to navigate around walls. Wait, in the last few observations, the agent defaulted to go forward, but then after some turning, ended up facing a scenario where the box is 1 step right and 1 forward. 

Looking at the current observation: the agent is facing a direction where forward is blocked by a wall in 2 steps. The box is to the right (east, assuming current facing direction) and one step forward. So the agent needs to turn right to face east, move right (east) once, which would place it adjacent to the box, then move forward to pick it up. 

But the possible actions are turn left, turn right, go forward, pick up, drop, toggle. Since the box is adjacent once the agent moves right once, then go forward, the agent can then pick it up. 

So the steps would be: turn right (to face east), go forward once (now 1 step right from previous position), then go forward again to reach the box. Wait, but in the current observation, the box is 1 step right and 1 step forward. So if the agent is facing north, then right is east. Moving forward once would be north, but the box is east and north. So maybe the agent needs to turn right to face east, move forward once (east), then turn north (but how?), or maybe adjust direction. Wait, perhaps the agent's current facing is such that turning right makes them face east, then moving forward once gets them to the box's x-coordinate, but they need to move north. 

Wait, maybe the agent's current direction is west. If they turn right, they face south. Hmm, this is getting confusing. Let me think again. 

The box is 1 step right and 1 step forward. So relative to the agent's current position, if they turn right (say, from facing north to east), then moving forward once would take them east, but the box is east and north. So maybe after turning right, they need to move forward once to get to the box's east position, then turn north (but turning left from east would be north), then move forward once. But the agent can only turn left or right, not adjust to specific directions beyond those. 

Alternatively, if the agent is facing south, turning right would face east. Then moving forward once would take them east, and the box is 1 east and 1 forward (north). So after moving east, they would need to turn north (left from east) and move forward. But the agent can't turn north directly; they have to turn left or right. 

Wait, maybe the agent's current direction is west. If they turn right, they face south. Moving forward once would take them south, but the box is east and north. This doesn't align. 

Alternatively, if the agent is facing north, and the box is 1 east and 1 north. Then turning right (east), moving forward once (east), then turning left (north), and moving forward once. But the agent can only turn left or right, so after facing east, turning left would face north. Then moving forward once would reach the box. 

So the sequence would be: turn right (to face east), go forward (to be east of previous position), turn left (to face north), go forward (to reach the box). Then pick up. 

But in the current observation, after moving right once, the agent would be at position where the box is 1 step forward. So after moving right once, the box is 1 step forward. Then the agent can go forward to reach it. Then pick up. 

So the first action needed is to turn right to face east, then go forward. 

Looking at the previous observations, the agent might have already turned right once. Let's check the history. 

In the last observation, the agent was facing a wall 2 steps forward, wall 3 steps right, and the box 1 right and 1 forward. The agent's previous action was 'turn left' leading to this observation. Wait, maybe the agent is facing north. Turning left would face west, but that might not help. Alternatively, the agent needs to turn right to face east. 

In the current observation, the walls are 2 steps forward (so if facing north, there's a wall 2 steps north) and 3 steps right (east). The box is 1 east and 1 north. So the agent is at position (0,0), facing north. Wall at (0,2), wall at (3,0). Box at (1,1). 

To get to the box, the agent needs to go east 1, north 1. So first turn right to face east, move forward (east) to (1,0), then turn left to face north, move forward to (1,1), then pick up. 

But in the current observation, the agent hasn't moved yet. So the first step would be turn right, then go forward. 

So the correct action here is 'turn right' to face east, allowing the agent to move towards the box. 

Wait, but in the current observation, the box is 1 step right and 1 forward. If the agent turns right (east), then moving forward once would place them at the same x as the box but one step south (if facing east, moving forward would be east, but the box is north of that position). Wait, no. If the agent is at (0,0), facing north. Wall at (0,2). Box is at (1,1). To get there, agent needs to move east to (1,0), then north to (1,1). So first action: turn right (east), go forward to (1,0). Then next action: turn left (north), go forward to (1,1), then pick up. 

But in the current observation, the agent is at (0,0), facing north. The action needed now is to turn right to face east, then go forward. 

So the first action should be 'turn right' to face east. Then 'go forward' to reach (1,0). Then 'turn left' to face north, then 'go forward' to reach (1,1), then 'pick up'. 

But in the current observation, the agent is at a point where the box is 1 step right and 1 forward. So after turning right, moving forward once would make the box 1 step forward. Then the agent can go forward again to reach it. 

Wait, if the agent turns right (east), then moves forward once, they are now facing east, one step east. The box is 1 east and 1 north. So from this new position, the box is 1 step north. So the agent needs to turn left (north) and move forward. But in the current observation, the agent's next observation after turning right and moving forward would show the box 1 step forward. 

Therefore, the immediate next action should be 'turn right' to face east, then 'go forward'. 

Yes, that makes sense. So the correct action here is 'turn right' to face the direction needed to move towards the box.

Let me try to figure out what to do here. The current observation says there's a wall 3 steps forward, a wall 2 steps left, and the purple box is 1 step left and 1 step forward. The goal is to get to the purple box.

First, I need to determine the agent's current orientation. The previous actions suggest they might have been turning left or right to navigate around the walls. But since the walls are on the left and forward, and the box is to the left and forward, I need to see how to reach it without hitting a wall.

Looking at the purple box's position: 1 step left and 1 step forward. That means if I'm facing north, the box is to the northwest. But if I'm facing east, maybe the position changes. Wait, without knowing the agent's current direction, it's a bit tricky. But based on previous actions, maybe the agent turned left or right to adjust direction.

Alternatively, maybe the agent is facing north. If the purple box is 1 step left (west) and 1 step forward (north), then from the current position, moving forward would hit the wall 3 steps ahead, but the box is only 1 step forward. Wait, no—the observation says the wall is 3 steps forward, but the box is 1 step left and 1 forward. So if the agent is facing a direction where forward is blocked by a wall 3 steps away, but the box is slightly left and forward.

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to adjust their direction. For example, if the agent turns left, then moving forward might take them towards the box. Let's think.

If the agent is facing north, the wall is 3 steps forward (north), and the wall to the left is 2 steps (west). The box is 1 step left (west) and 1 step forward (north). So the box is diagonally northwest. To get there, the agent would need to go west 1 step and north 1 step. But since the immediate forward is blocked by a wall 3 steps away, but the box is only 1 step forward and left. Wait, but how can the box be 1 step left and 1 step forward if the forward direction is blocked by a wall 3 steps away? Maybe the agent is not facing north. Let me try another direction.

Suppose the agent is facing east. Then, the wall is 3 steps forward (east), and the wall 2 steps left (north). The box is 1 step left (north) and 1 step forward (east). So the box is northeast. To reach it, the agent would need to go north and east. But the immediate forward is a wall, so they can't go straight. Maybe turn left to face north, then go forward. But the wall is only 2 steps left (north), which would mean if the agent turns left (north), then moves forward, they can go 2 steps north, but the box is 1 step north and 1 step east. So after turning left (north), moving forward once would get to the box's north position, but then they need to go east. But facing north, east would be their right. So after moving north once, they can turn right (east) and then go forward once to reach the box. But how do they know that's possible?

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to turn left to face north, then move forward once (since the wall is 2 steps left, which would be north, so moving north once is possible). Then, turn right to face east and move forward once to reach the box. But the current observation doesn't mention any obstacles in those directions beyond the walls mentioned. Wait, the observation lists walls at specific distances. So if turning left (north) and moving forward once, then there's no wall immediately in that path. Similarly, turning right (south?) No, if facing east, left is north, right is south. But the wall to the left is 2 steps north, so moving north once is safe. Then turning right (south) would be the opposite direction of the box. Hmm, maybe this approach isn't correct.

Wait, the purple box is 1 step left and 1 step forward from the current position. Let's visualize:

Current position (C). If facing direction D, left is L and forward is F.

If the box is 1L and 1F, then from C, moving L and then F would get to the box. Or moving F first then L.

But the immediate forward path (F) has a wall 3 steps away. So moving F isn't directly possible. But the box is only 1 step F and L. So maybe the agent needs to adjust their direction to face a direction where moving L and then F would reach the box.

Alternatively, maybe the agent is facing south. Then, left would be west, forward is south. The wall is 3 steps forward (south), and the box is 1 step left (west) and 1 step forward (south). That would place the box 1 step west and 1 step south from current. But moving forward (south) would hit the wall, but the box is only 1 step forward, so maybe the wall is further away. Wait, the observation says a wall 3 steps forward, so if facing south, moving south 3 steps hits a wall. The box is 1 step forward (south) and 1 step left (west). So from current position, moving west 1 step and south 1 step would reach the box. But moving south first is blocked by the wall. So the agent would need to move west first, then south. But the observation mentions a wall 2 steps left (if facing south, left is west, which is a wall 2 steps away). So moving west 2 steps would hit a wall, but the box is only 1 step west. So maybe the agent can move west once, then south once. But how to do that without hitting the wall.

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to turn right. If facing south, turning right would face east. Then moving forward (east) is possible, but the box is west and south. That doesn't help.

This is getting confusing. Let's try to map out possible directions.

Another approach: The agent's goal is to reach the purple box at 1 step left and 1 step forward. So relative to the agent's current facing direction:

- If the agent is facing north, left is west, forward is north. The box is 1 west and 1 north. But the wall is 3 steps north. So moving north would hit the wall at 3 steps, but the box is only 1 step north. So maybe the wall is beyond the box. That can't be. So perhaps the agent is not facing north.

If facing east, left is north, forward is east. The box is 1 north and 1 east. The wall is 3 steps east and 2 steps north. So moving north 1 step (left) and then east 1 step (forward) would reach the box. But how? The agent would need to turn left to face north, move forward 1 step (but the wall is 2 steps north, so moving 1 step is okay), then turn right to face east, and move forward 1 step to the box. But the current observation doesn't mention obstacles in those paths beyond what's stated. So maybe that's the way.

But the previous actions had the agent turning left and right, maybe getting stuck in a loop. The latest observation shows a wall 3 steps forward, 2 steps left, and the box 1 left and 1 forward. The agent needs to find a path to the box without hitting walls.

So, possible actions:

Check the direction. If the agent is facing a direction where turning left allows them to move towards the box. For example, if facing east, turning left (north) and moving forward once, then turning right (east) and moving forward once. But need to verify if that's possible.

Alternatively, if the agent turns left (north), faces north, moves forward once (since there's a wall 3 steps forward, but the box is only 1 step forward and left). Wait, if facing north, moving forward 1 step would be towards the box's forward direction, but the box is also 1 step left (west). So after moving forward 1 step north, the agent would be 1 step north of current position, and the box is 1 step west from there. So then the agent would need to turn left (west) and move forward 1 step to reach the box. But turning left from facing north would face west, and moving forward 1 step would reach the box. However, the observation mentions a wall 2 steps left (west) when facing the original direction. Wait, original direction isn't known, but previous observations had walls on left and forward. Maybe the agent was facing, say, east, with walls to the north (left) and east (forward). Then the box is north and east. But this is getting too speculative.

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to adjust their direction to face southwest, so that moving left and forward aligns with the box's position. But that's more complicated.

Another angle: The agent needs to get to a position where the purple box is directly in front or to the side, then pick it up. The current observation shows the box is 1 left and 1 forward. So the agent needs to reorient themselves so that moving in a direction that covers both left and forward steps leads them to the box.

Perhaps turning left would face them in a direction where moving forward once gets them to the box's left position, then another move. But without knowing the current facing direction, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, the agent could try to move forward if possible, but the forward path has a wall 3 steps away, but the box is only 1 step forward and left. So moving forward 1 step would take them to a position where they can then turn left and pick up the box. But the wall is 3 steps forward, so moving forward 1 step is allowed, as the wall is beyond that. Wait, the observation says ""a wall 3 steps forward"", which means that 3 steps in the forward direction is a wall. So moving forward 1 step would be safe, right? Because the wall is 3 steps away, not blocking the immediate next step. So maybe the agent can move forward once, which would place them 1 step forward, then turn left (which would be west) and move forward once to reach the box.

Let me check the observation again: ""a wall 3 steps forward"" and ""a purple box 1 step left and 1 step forward"". So if the agent moves forward once, they are now 1 step forward from the original position. The wall is still 3 steps forward from the original position, so from the new position, the wall is 2 steps forward. The purple box is now at the original position's left (which would be the agent's left after moving forward). So after moving forward once, the agent's new position has the box 1 step left and 0 steps forward (since they moved forward already). So the agent would need to turn left (west) and then move forward once to reach the box. That seems feasible.

But the problem is whether the agent can detect that moving forward is safe. The observation states there's a wall 3 steps forward, which implies that moving forward once, twice, or three times would eventually hit a wall, but the first step is safe. So moving forward is a valid action here.

Therefore, the agent should first move forward once to get closer to the box. Then turn left and move forward to reach the box. However, in the current observation, the purple box is 1 step left and 1 step forward. So moving forward once would make the box 1 step left (relative to the new position). Then turning left (west) and moving forward once would reach the box.

So the immediate action should be ""go forward"" to get into position to then turn left and pick up the box.

Let's see. The current observation is a wall 2 steps forward and a purple box 1 step left. So I need to figure out how to get to the purple box.

First, my agent's position and direction are important. Let's assume the agent is facing a certain direction. The wall is 2 steps forward, meaning if I go forward twice, there's a wall blocking the path. But the purple box is to the left and one step forward. 

So, to reach the box, I need to adjust my direction. The box is 1 step left and 1 step forward from my current position. If I'm currently facing, say, north, then left would be west. But the wall 2 steps forward is north, so if I'm facing north, the left direction is west. The box is west 1 and north 1. 

Wait, the observations mention the box's position relative to the agent. The box is 1 step left and 1 step forward. So if the agent is facing north, left is west, forward is north. So the box is at northwest relative to the agent's current position.

But the agent can't go straight forward because there's a wall 2 steps forward. So perhaps the agent needs to turn left (west) to face a direction where the box is straight ahead. Then move forward once, then turn left again to face north? Wait, no. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to turn left to face west. Then move forward 1 step to reach the box's position. But wait, the box is 1 step left and 1 step forward from the current position. If the agent turns left (west), then moving forward once would be west 1, which is the left direction, but the box is also 1 step forward. Maybe the box is in the direction that's left and forward from the current position.

Alternatively, maybe the agent is facing east. Then left would be north. The wall is 2 steps forward (east), and the box is 1 step left (north) and 1 step forward (east). So the box is at northeast. Wait, that doesn't make sense. If the box is 1 step left (north) and 1 step forward (east), that would place it diagonally northeast relative to the agent. But how to reach that?

Hmm, perhaps the agent needs to turn left (north), then move forward 1 step to get to the box's position. But if the wall is 2 steps forward when facing east, then if the agent turns left to face north, moving forward 1 step would take them to a new position. But the box is north 1 and east 1 from current position. So maybe the agent needs to first turn left (north), move forward once, then turn right (east), but that might hit a wall. Wait, but the current observation only mentions walls in forward direction (2 steps) and to the left (3 steps right in previous observations?), but in this current observation, the walls are only 2 steps forward and the box is 1 step left.

Wait, the current observation is: a wall 2 steps forward and a purple box 1 step left. So, if the agent is facing a direction where forward is blocked by a wall 2 steps away, and to the left is the purple box 1 step away. So, if the agent turns left, they can reach the box by moving forward once. Because the box is 1 step left, which would be the new forward direction after turning left. And the wall is 2 steps in the original forward direction. So the correct action here is to turn left, then move forward once to pick up the box. But the current observation says the purple box is 1 step left, not 1 step forward. So perhaps the agent needs to turn left to face the direction where the box is, then move forward once. Then pick up the box. But the action here is to choose between turn left, turn right, go forward, etc. Since the box is 1 step left, turning left would align the agent's forward direction to the box's location. Then moving forward once would get them to the box. So the next action should be to turn left to face the box, then go forward. But the user is asking for the next action based on the current observation. So the immediate action needed is to turn left, which allows the agent to face the box, then go forward. Since the current observation only shows the box 1 step left, turning left is the correct first step.
