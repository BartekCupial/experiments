Let's see. I need to get to the blue key. The current observation says there's a wall 4 steps forward and a wall 1 step to the right. So the agent is probably facing a direction where forward is blocked by a wall, and to the right is also a wall. The blue key must be somewhere else, but the observation here doesn't mention it. Maybe I need to reorient myself.

Since I can't go forward or right because of walls, turning left or right might be necessary. Let's think. If I turn left, maybe the path forward becomes available. Or turning right. But the observation only mentions walls in those directions relative to the current facing. So if I turn left, the forward direction would now be somewhere else. But how do I know where the key is? The problem is that the observation doesn't include the agent's current position or facing direction relative to the key. Hmm.

Wait, the agent's goal is the blue key. The observation here shows walls in front and to the right. So maybe the agent is in a position where it's facing a wall, and to the right is also a wall. To navigate, the agent needs to turn in a direction that allows moving towards the key. But without knowing where the key is, the only option is to try turning and see. Since the key isn't in the current observation, perhaps the agent needs to explore by turning left or right. 

But according to the tips, once the desired object is in front, toggle it. But here, there's no object except walls. So the agent can't pick up anything yet. The possible actions are turn left, right, go forward (which is blocked), pick up (nothing to pick), drop (nothing holding), toggle (nothing to toggle). So the only possible actions are turning left or right.

Since the agent needs to navigate, maybe turning left would open up a new path. Let's assume that turning left would allow the agent to face a direction where there's no wall in front. So the best action here is to turn left. Alternatively, turning right, but since both directions have walls in their immediate steps, turning left might be a safe bet to explore further. The agent can't move forward, so turning is the only way to proceed. Therefore, the chosen action should be to turn left.

Let's see where I need to go. The goal is to get the blue key. The current observation says there's a blue key 1 step left and 1 step forward. So I need to figure out how to reach that position.

First, let me visualize the environment. The agent is probably facing a certain direction. The previous action was to turn left, which might have changed the agent's orientation. Now, the walls are 6 steps forward and 3 steps left. The blue key is diagonally to the left and forward. 

Hmm, the key is 1 step left and 1 step forward. So from the current position, if I can move forward and then left, I can reach the key. But I need to check where I'm facing. Since after turning left, the forward direction might now be where the previous left was. Wait, turning left changes the facing direction. Let's assume the initial direction was north. Turning left would make the agent face west. Then moving forward would go west, but the wall is 6 steps west. However, the key is 1 step left (which would now be north) and 1 step forward (west). That doesn't add up. Maybe my initial assumption about the directions is off.

Alternatively, maybe after turning left, the agent is facing a direction where forward is now north. Wait, maybe the directions are relative. Let's think differently. The agent's current facing direction isn't explicitly stated, but the walls are in certain directions relative to that. So if after turning left, the wall is 6 steps forward and 3 steps left, then the agent might be facing a direction where forward is blocked by a wall after 6 steps, and to the left (which would be 90 degrees from forward) there's a wall 3 steps away. 

The blue key is 1 step left and 1 step forward. So relative to the current facing direction, left is the direction where the wall is 3 steps. So to get to the key, the agent needs to move forward one step (since that's part of the key's position) and then left another step. But wait, the key is 1 step left and 1 step forward. So if the agent is facing a direction where forward is one step towards the key, then moving forward first would get them closer. Then turning left (which would now align them to face the direction of the remaining left step) and then moving forward again. 

Wait, but the blue key's position is 1 left and 1 forward from the current position. So if the agent is facing, say, north, then left would be west. So the key is 1 west and 1 north. So to get there, the agent would need to move north (forward) once, then west (left) once. But in the current observation, after turning left, the walls are 6 forward and 3 left. So moving forward 6 steps would hit a wall, but the key is only 1 step forward. That suggests that the agent can move forward once without hitting a wall. Then, after moving forward, the agent would be facing the same direction (since moving forward doesn't change their facing), but the key is now 1 step left. So the agent would need to turn left again to face the direction of the key's left (which would now be west if they were facing north after moving forward). Then move forward once to pick up the key.

Wait, but the current observation says the key is 1 step left and 1 step forward. So if the agent is facing a direction where left is west and forward is north, then moving forward 1 step (north) gets them to a position where the key is 1 step west (left). Then they can turn left (now facing west) and move forward to get the key. But after moving forward initially, the walls might have changed. However, the observation given is the current one after turning left. So the walls are 6 forward and 3 left. The key is in the position 1 left and 1 forward. So perhaps the agent needs to first move forward once (since the key is 1 step forward), then turn left and move forward once. 

But before that, the agent should check if they are holding anything. If not, they need to move towards the key. So the sequence would be: move forward once to reach the position where the key is 1 step left. Then turn left to face the direction of the key, then move forward once to pick it up. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent can move forward once, then turn left, then move forward. So the actions would be go forward, turn left, go forward, then pick up. But the current observation shows the key's position relative to the agent's current position. So the agent needs to first adjust their direction to face towards the key. 

Wait, maybe the agent should first move forward towards the key. Since the key is 1 step left and 1 step forward, moving forward one step would align the key to be one step to the left. Then, turning left would face the agent towards the key, and moving forward once would get them to the key. 

But how does the agent know their current facing direction? Since the previous action was to turn left, and the observation after that shows walls 6 steps forward and 3 steps left, the agent is now facing a direction where forward is blocked by a wall after 6 steps, and left is blocked after 3. The key is 1 left and 1 forward, so that would place it in a direction that's both within the non-wall areas. 

So the agent needs to move forward once (since the key is 1 step forward from current position) to get into a position where the key is now 1 step to the left. Then turn left (which would now face the direction of the key's left), and move forward once to reach the key. Then pick it up. 

So the chosen actions would be: go forward, then turn left, then go forward, then pick up. But the current observation is after turning left, and the key is in position. So the next step is to move forward towards the key. 

Wait, the current observation is:

a wall 6 steps forward

a wall 3 steps left

a blue key 1 step left and 1 step forward

So the agent is facing a direction where forward is blocked by a wall at 6 steps, left is blocked at 3 steps. The key is 1 left and 1 forward. That implies that moving forward 1 step would get the agent to a position where the key is 1 step to the left. Then, turning left (which would be the new direction) and moving forward would reach the key. 

So the correct sequence is: go forward (to get to the position where the key is left ahead), then turn left, then go forward to the key, then pick up. 

But the user is asking for the next action. So the first action should be to move forward, since the key is 1 step forward. But wait, is there a wall in that direction? The wall is 6 steps forward, so moving one step forward is possible. So the first action should be go forward. Then, after moving forward, the agent would be in a position where the key is 1 step left. Then turn left, then go forward, then pick up. 

But the current observation already includes the key's position. So the immediate next step is to go forward to reduce the distance to the key. So the chosen action is go forward. Then, after that, the agent would turn left, move forward, and pick up.

2,turn left,"<reasoning>
The current observation says there's a wall 5 steps forward and a blue key 1 step left. I need to reach the blue key.

In the previous steps, I turned left, then went forward to get closer to the key. Now, the key is directly to my left. But there's a wall 5 steps forward. So if I try to go forward again, I'll hit the wall. 

The key is left of me. So I need to turn in a direction that allows me to face the key. Wait, in the last observation, the key was 1 step left and 1 step forward. After moving forward, maybe I turned left again? Or perhaps I'm facing a different direction now. 

Wait, the previous action was 'go forward' which got the key to 1 step left. So after moving forward, I'm now positioned such that the key is to my left. That means I need to turn left to face the key. Once facing left, I can go forward once to pick it up. 

But the current observation says the key is 1 step left. So if I turn left, then go forward, that should get me to the key. Then I can pick it up. 

So the steps would be: turn left to face the key's direction, then go forward to reach it. After that, use 'pick up' to get the key. 

But the current observation only shows the key's position relative to me. The walls are in different directions now. The wall is 5 steps forward, which might be in front of the current direction I'm facing. 

So the immediate action needed is to turn left to face the key, which is then 1 step forward. But the user's last action was 'go forward', which probably changed the agent's direction. Let me think again. 

Wait, after the previous 'go forward' action, the agent was positioned such that the key is now 1 step left. So if the agent is facing north, then the key would be to the west (left). So turning left would make the agent face west. Then going forward would take them to the key. 

Therefore, the correct actions would be turn left, then go forward, then pick up. 

But the current observation's key is 1 step left. So first, the agent needs to adjust their facing direction. Since the last action was 'go forward', which might have changed their orientation. Let me check the previous steps again.

In the user's history:

First observation: walls forward and right. Agent turned left.

Second observation: walls further forward and left, key 1 left and 1 forward. Agent went forward.

Third observation (current): walls forward 5 steps, key 1 left.

So after moving forward, the key is now 1 step left. That suggests that the agent is facing a direction where left is towards the key. So to get to the key, the agent needs to turn left (if not already facing that direction) and go forward. 

But how does the agent's current facing direction affect this? Let's assume after the first 'turn left', the agent is facing west. Then moving forward (second action) would take them towards west, but the key was 1 left and 1 forward. Wait, maybe I need to model the directions.

Alternatively, perhaps the agent is facing north after the first 'turn left' (original direction was, say, east; turning left makes north). Then moving forward (second action) would take them north. Then the key is 1 left (west) and 1 forward (north). So from that position, the key is west and north. Wait, that doesn't add up. Maybe the coordinate system is relative each time. 

Alternatively, perhaps each time you move forward, your direction stays the same, and the observations are relative to your current facing. So after turning left, moving forward would change your position, and the walls/key are in directions relative to your new facing. 

This is getting a bit complicated. Let's focus on the current observation. The current observation shows the key is 1 step left. The wall is 5 steps forward. So the agent is facing a direction where forward is blocked by a wall, but left is clear. 

To get the key, which is 1 step left, the agent needs to turn left (to face the direction where the key is), then go forward once. Then pick it up. 

So the immediate action should be 'turn left' to face the key's direction. Then 'go forward' to pick it up. 

But the current observation's key is 1 step left. So if I turn left, then go forward, that's the path. 

So the correct action here is 'turn left' to align with the key's direction, then 'go forward' to reach it. But since the agent hasn't picked it up yet, the next step after turning left would be to go forward. 

However, the user is asking for the next action based on the current observation. The current observation is after the previous 'go forward' action. In that observation, the key is 1 step left. So the agent must turn left to face the key, then go forward. 

Therefore, the correct action now is 'turn left' to face the direction of the key, which is 1 step left from the agent's current position. Once turned left, moving forward will reach the key. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent is already facing the correct direction. Wait, after moving forward in the previous step, the key became 1 step left. If the agent was facing north, moving forward would take them north, and the key being 1 left (west) would mean the agent needs to turn left (west) to face it. 

Therefore, the next action is 'turn left' to face west, then 'go forward' to get the key. 

So the immediate action should be 'turn left' to align with the key's direction. Then 'go forward' to pick it up. 

Since the current observation hasn't picked up the key yet, the first step is to turn left. 

So the answer is 'turn left', then 'go forward', then 'pick up'. But the user is asking for the next action based on the current observation. So the first action needed is 'turn left' to face the key, which is 1 step left. Once turned, then go forward. 

Therefore, the correct answer here is 'turn left' to face the key.
