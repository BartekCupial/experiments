Let's see. The current observation is that there's a wall 2 steps forward and a wall 3 steps left. My goal is to get to the blue key, so I need to figure out how to navigate around these walls.

First, I'm probably facing a certain direction. Since there's a wall 2 steps forward, maybe I should turn to a direction where there's no wall. The wall to the left is 3 steps, so turning right might be a good idea. If I turn right, then I can go forward past the wall on my left. Wait, but if I turn right, the wall in front was originally 2 steps. Or maybe the walls are in different directions relative to my current facing. 

Wait, maybe I need to check possible directions. If there's a wall 2 steps forward and a wall 3 steps left, perhaps I should turn right first to avoid the walls. Let's think: if I'm facing north, then a wall 2 steps forward (north) and a wall 3 steps left (west). If I turn right (east), then the forward direction is east, which might not have a wall. Then I can go forward. But how do I know where the blue key is? The problem is there's no info about the key's location in the current observation. Hmm. 

Since the observation only mentions walls, I have to assume the rest is open. Maybe the blue key is behind one of these walls, but that doesn't make sense because walls are solid. Wait, maybe the key is in another direction not blocked by walls. But without knowing the key's position, I have to choose an action that allows movement. 

Available actions: turn left, turn right, go forward, pick up, drop, toggle. But since there's a wall 2 steps forward, going forward now would hit the wall. So go forward is not possible. Turning left would face the wall that's 3 steps to the left. Wait, if I'm facing north, turning left would face west, and there's a wall 3 steps west. So turning left and going forward would hit that wall. Similarly, turning right (east) would have the wall 2 steps forward (east). Wait, no, if I turn right from facing north, I face east. The original observation says a wall 2 steps forward (so originally north) and a wall 3 steps left (west). So after turning right (east), the forward direction is east. Is there a wall there? The original observation doesn't mention a wall in the east. So maybe I can go forward east. 

But how do I know that's safe? The current observation only mentions the walls in forward and left. So the other directions might be clear. So the best action is to turn right to face east, then go forward. That way, I can move away from the walls. Alternatively, maybe turn left and go forward, but that would face the west wall which is 3 steps away. If I go forward left, which would be west, hitting the wall. So turning right seems better. 

So I should choose to turn right first, then go forward. But since the action must be only one, I have to pick either turn right or go forward. But if I try to go forward now, I hit the wall. So I need to turn right first. Therefore, the best first action is to turn right.

1,turn right,"<reasoning>
Let's see. The current observation says there's a wall 4 steps forward and a wall 2 steps left. The goal is to get to the blue key. Earlier, after turning right, the observation changed slightly, but now there's a wall even further forward and a wall closer to the left.

Hmm, maybe I need to figure out my direction. The first action was to turn right, which changed the observation a bit. Now, with walls in front and to the left, I can't go straight forward anymore. Maybe the blue key isn't in front of me. Since walls are blocking the forward direction, perhaps I should try moving in another direction. Let's think about possible actions.

If I turn right again, that might face me a different direction, maybe clear of the walls. Alternatively, turning left could also change my facing direction. Let's see. The previous observation after turning right had a wall 2 steps left. Now, after another possible turn, maybe turning right again would make the forward path less blocked. Alternatively, if I turn left, perhaps the wall on the left is now behind me, and the forward path might be clear. 

Wait, but the current observation mentions a wall 2 steps left. If I'm facing north, for example, a wall 2 steps left would be west. If I turn right (to face east), then the wall 2 steps left would be south. But the forward direction would now be east, which previously had a wall 4 steps forward. Hmm. Maybe I need to check if there's a way around the walls. Since the walls are blocking forward and left, maybe I need to go backwards or around. But going backward might not be helpful unless there's a path there. 

Alternatively, perhaps the key is in a different direction. Since I can't go forward or left due to walls, maybe I need to explore other directions. Let's try turning right again. If I turn right (third time), then my direction changes, and maybe the forward path is clear. Or maybe toggle an object if there's something in front, but there's a wall there. So toggling wouldn't work. 

Another thought: maybe I need to backtrack. If I go backward, but the problem is that the observation doesn't mention anything behind. So unless there's a path there, going back might not help. 

Wait, the initial observation had a wall 2 steps forward and another wall 3 steps left. After turning right, the walls moved to 4 steps forward and 2 steps left. So maybe the agent is navigating a grid with walls forming a barrier. The key is probably in a different part of the grid that's not immediately adjacent. 

Since the walls are in the forward and left directions, perhaps the best move is to turn right again to change direction and explore another path. Alternatively, turn left to face a different direction. Let's see: turning right again (second time) would make the agent face a direction where the forward path might have less obstruction. Alternatively, turning left once would face the agent west, and the wall 2 steps left (which was originally north?) might be in a different position. 

This is getting a bit confusing without a map. But given the tips, I shouldn't repeat the same action if the observation doesn't change. The user previously turned right, which changed the observation. Now, the new observation has walls further forward but closer left. So maybe turning right again is a good idea to continue exploring a new direction. Alternatively, if turning right again leads to another wall, perhaps turning left would be better. 

I think the safest next step is to turn right again to face a new direction, check the new observation, and then proceed. That way, I can see if there's a path forward or if I need to adjust further.

 <sep> human:","a wall 5 steps forward
a wall 3 steps right
a blue key 2 steps right and 3 steps forward",0,False
2,turn left,"<reasoning>
The current observation shows that there's a wall 5 steps forward, a wall 3 steps to the right, and a blue key located 2 steps right and 3 steps forward. The goal is to get to the blue key.

First, I need to figure out the agent's current direction. Since the previous actions were turning right twice, the agent must now be facing a direction where turning right again would align them properly. Let's think about the movement.

After two turns right, the agent's direction would have changed 90 degrees each time. Starting from, say, north, turning right would face east, then another right would face south. But the latest observation mentions walls in front (5 steps) and right (3 steps). If the agent is facing south, then ""forward"" would be south, and the wall to the right would be east. But the blue key is 2 steps right and 3 forward. If facing south, ""right"" is east, so 2 steps east and 3 steps south. But given the walls, maybe the path isn't directly clear.

Alternatively, maybe the agent is facing east after two right turns. Let me check: initial direction could be north. First turn right to east, second turn right to south. Now facing south. The wall 5 steps forward (south) and wall 3 steps right (east). The blue key is 2 steps right (east) and 3 steps forward (south). So from the current position, moving east 2 steps and south 3 steps. But the path might be blocked. Wait, but the key is located at that position. So the agent needs to navigate to that spot.

But how? The walls are in front and to the right. To reach the key, which is east and then south, maybe the agent needs to turn left to face west, then go forward, but that's blocked by a wall. Wait, no. Let me map this out.

Current direction is south. Forward is blocked by a wall 5 steps. Right is east, blocked 3 steps. The key is 2 east and 3 south. So from current position, moving east 2 would get to the key's x-coordinate, but then moving south 3 from there. But since the agent can't go forward if there's a wall, maybe they need to adjust direction.

Alternatively, maybe turn around. If the agent turns left twice (which would be 180 degrees from south, facing north), then go forward 3 steps. But the wall is 5 steps forward originally, but after turning around, forward would be north, which might not have a wall. Wait, but the initial walls were 2 steps forward in the first observation. Wait, the observations have changed over time. The first observation had a wall 2 steps forward and 3 left. After turning right twice, the next observation had walls 4 forward and 2 left, then now 5 forward and 3 right. So maybe the agent is moving in a grid where turning right and moving changes the walls.

This is getting a bit confusing. Let's try another approach. The key is 2 steps right and 3 forward. The agent needs to face a direction where moving right and forward gets them there. If the agent is facing east, then right would be south. But the key is 2 east and 3 south. So if the agent is facing east, moving right (south) 3 steps and then east 2 steps. But the current walls are 5 forward (east) and 3 right (south). So moving forward 3 steps when facing east would reach the key's forward direction (since the key is 3 steps forward from the current position if facing east?), but wait, the key is 2 steps right and 3 forward. So if facing east, right is south. So to get to the key, the agent would need to move south 3 steps (right) and then east 2 steps (forward). But the problem is the walls. The current forward direction (east) has a wall 5 steps away, meaning the agent can't go east beyond that. But the key is 2 steps east and 3 south. So the agent can't go east 2 steps first because the wall is 5 steps forward (east) but maybe that's the initial position. Wait, perhaps the agent has moved around already. This is getting complicated.

Alternatively, since the key is two steps right and three forward, maybe the agent needs to turn to face a direction where right and forward movements lead there. For example, if facing north, right would be east. So moving right (east) two steps and forward (north) three steps. But the current forward direction (north) might have a wall. Wait, no, in the current observation, forward is blocked by a wall 5 steps. If facing north, that's the problem. So the agent must be facing a direction where forward is blocked, but the key is in a different direction.

Alternatively, the agent could turn left to face west. Then, moving forward (west) might not be blocked. But the walls are 3 steps to the right (which would be south if facing west). The key is 2 steps right (south) and 3 forward (west). So from current position facing west, moving forward 3 steps (west) would reach the key's forward direction, then turn right (south) and move 2 steps. But moving forward 3 steps when facing west might be possible if there's no wall. Wait, the current observation says a wall 5 steps forward. If facing west, then forward is west, and the wall is 5 steps west. So moving forward 3 steps would be possible, reaching 3 steps west, then turning right (south) and moving 2 steps. That might work.

So the steps could be: turn left (to face west), go forward 3 steps (since the wall is 5 steps away, so 3 steps is possible), then turn right (to face south), go forward 2 steps. Then pick up the key. But in the current observation, the key is 2 steps right and 3 forward. If after facing west and moving 3 forward, then turning right (south) and moving 2 forward (south), that would position the agent at 3 west and 2 south from the original position. Wait, but the key is at 2 right and 3 forward. Maybe my coordinate system is off.

Alternatively, maybe the agent's current position is such that the blue key is in an accessible location. Let's think of the possible actions. The agent is currently facing a direction where forward is blocked (5 steps), right is blocked (3 steps). The key is 2 right and 3 forward. So from the current position, to get to the key, the agent needs to move in a direction where right and forward are possible.

If the agent turns left (now facing west), then moving forward 3 steps (west), then turning right (south), moving 2 steps south. Then the agent would be at the key's location. But how does that align with the key's position? The key is 2 steps right and 3 forward from the current position. If the agent is facing west, moving forward 3 steps (west) would be 3 steps forward. Then turning right (south) and moving 2 steps (south). So from the original position, moving west 3, then south 2. The key is 2 steps right (east?) and 3 forward (north?). Hmm, maybe my coordinate system is flipped.

Alternatively, maybe the key's position is relative to the agent's current direction. So if the agent is facing south, then right is east. The key is 2 east and 3 south. So the agent would need to move east 2 and south 3. But the wall is 5 steps south (forward), which means the agent can't move past that. So maybe the agent can't go straight south. Therefore, the agent needs to find a path around the walls.

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to turn around. If the agent turns left twice (now facing north), then the forward direction is north, which may not have a wall. But the previous observations showed that walls changed positions. The first observation had a wall 2 steps forward, then 4, then 5. So maybe moving forward in different directions affects the walls. This is getting too ambiguous without a map.

Alternatively, the best immediate action is to move towards the key. Since the key is 2 steps right and 3 forward, and the agent is currently facing a direction where forward is blocked, perhaps turning left to face a direction where moving forward and right can lead to the key. For example, turning left (west), moving forward until the wall is no longer in the way, then turning right (south), and moving towards the key. But the current observation says forward is 5 steps to the wall, right is 3 steps to the wall. So if the agent turns left (west), forward is west, which may not have a wall immediately. Wait, in the current observation, the walls are 5 forward and 3 right. If the agent is facing south, forward is south (5 steps to wall), right is east (3 steps to wall). If the agent turns left (west), then forward is west, and the wall might not be in the way. The key is 2 right (east) and 3 forward (west) from current position. So if the agent turns left (west), moves forward 3 steps (since the key is 3 forward), then turns right (south) and moves 2 steps. That would place the agent at the key's location. Then the agent can pick it up.

So the actions would be: turn left, go forward 3, turn right, go forward 2, then pick up. But the problem is that the agent must choose one action at a time. The current observation is after previous actions, so the agent needs to pick the next best action.

Looking at the current observation, the walls are 5 forward and 3 right. The key is 2 right and 3 forward. The agent needs to navigate to that position. Since moving forward is currently blocked (5 steps), turning left (to face west) would allow moving forward 3 steps (since the key is 3 forward from current position when facing west). Wait, if facing west, moving forward 3 steps would get them to the key's forward position (3 steps west), and then turning right (south) and moving 2 steps would reach the key. So the next action should be to turn left to face west, allowing them to move forward towards the key.

Alternatively, maybe the agent should first try to move forward while avoiding walls. But given the current walls, turning left seems necessary.

3,turn left,"<reasoning>
The agent is trying to reach the blue key. Let me look at the current observation again. The observation says there's a wall 4 steps forward and a wall 2 steps left. From the previous steps, the agent turned right twice, which probably changed their direction. Now they need to figure out the path.

Looking back at the history, the blue key was located at 2 steps right and 3 steps forward in one of the earlier observations. But now, with the updated observation, the walls have shifted. The walls are now further forward and to the left. So the agent's current orientation might be different.

The agent needs to navigate towards the blue key. Since the key's position isn't mentioned in the current observation, maybe the agent is facing a direction where the key isn't directly visible. The walls are blocking straight paths, so the agent might need to adjust their direction again. 

The possible actions are turn left, turn right, go forward, pick up, drop, toggle. Since there's a wall 4 steps forward, going forward isn't an option. The wall 2 steps left might mean the agent is facing north or another direction where left is a blocked path. 

The agent could turn left or right to change direction. But based on previous actions, turning right twice might have made them face east, then south. Wait, maybe the agent is in a grid. Let's try mapping it out.

Suppose initially the agent is facing north. First observation: wall 2 steps forward (north), wall 3 steps left (west). So turning right (east) reduces the left wall distance to 2 steps. Second observation: wall 4 steps forward (east), wall 2 steps left (south). Wait, that doesn't align. Maybe the agent turned right again, facing south. Then walls are 4 steps forward (south) and 2 steps left (east). Hmm, getting confused.

Alternatively, maybe each turn changes direction. Let's say initial direction is north. First turn right to face east. Now, walls: forward (east) 4 steps, left (north) 2 steps. But the key was 2 steps right and 3 forward from the initial position. If the agent is now facing east, turning right again would face south. Then walls forward (south) 5 steps, right (east) 3 steps. But the current observation after two rights is walls 5 forward and 3 right. 

But the current observation after the user's last input is walls 4 forward and 2 left. So maybe after a turn right, the agent's direction is such that left is now a different direction. 

The agent needs to reach the blue key. Since the key's position isn't in the current observation, the agent must navigate based on past information. Maybe the agent should try to go forward when possible. But currently, moving forward is blocked by a wall 4 steps away. So turning left or right to find a path that leads towards the key's known location. 

In the previous observation, the key was 2 steps right and 3 forward. If the agent is now facing a direction where turning left would align them towards that path, that might be the way. Alternatively, turning right. But without knowing the exact direction, the agent has to make a strategic turn. 

Given that the agent previously turned right twice, maybe turning left now would face them in a direction that allows progressing towards the key. For example, if the agent was facing south after two rights, turning left would face east, which might be closer to the key's location. 

Alternatively, since the current walls are 4 forward and 2 left, turning left might open up a path forward. Wait, if the agent turns left, their new left direction would be the previous forward direction. But there's a wall 4 steps forward, so turning left would change their orientation but the wall is still in front. Hmm, maybe not. 

Alternatively, the agent could try to go around the walls. Since moving forward is blocked, turning right might lead to a direction where there's a path. But the current observation doesn't mention walls to the right. The last observation had a wall 3 steps right, but that's in the previous step. 

This is a bit confusing. Since the agent can't see the key anymore, they have to rely on prior information. The key was at 2 right and 3 forward from the initial position. So the agent might need to adjust their direction to head in that direction. 

If the agent turns left, that could align them towards the necessary path. For example, if they were facing east, turning left would face north, which might not help. But if they were facing south, turning left would face west, which might be towards the key. 

Alternatively, the agent could try to go forward when possible. But since there's a wall 4 steps forward, that's not an option. So the best action is to turn left or right to change direction, possibly towards the key's known location. 

Given the previous actions of turning right twice, maybe turning left now would be the next logical step to explore a different direction. So the chosen action would be to turn left again.

4,turn right,"<reasoning>
Let's see where I am. The current observation says there's a wall 2 steps forward and a wall 3 steps left. Looking back at the previous interactions, this seems familiar. Earlier, the user started with a wall 2 steps forward and 3 left, then turned right, leading to a wall 4 forward and 2 left. Then another right turn led to 5 forward and 3 right, where the blue key was spotted 2 steps right and 3 forward. After turning left, the observation changed to walls 4 forward and 2 left, then turning left again brings us back to 2 forward and 3 left.

So the pattern here is turning right twice when facing the initial walls, then turning left twice to circle back. But the blue key is located in a direction that might require navigating around these walls. 

In the last observation before the current one, after turning left, the walls were 4 forward and 2 left. Now we're back to 2 forward and 3 left. Maybe I need to adjust my direction again. 

The key is somewhere 2 steps right and 3 forward from the position where the blue key was first observed. But with walls blocking the way, I need to find a path around them. 

Looking at the current position: walls ahead and to the left. If I turn left again, that might face me in a direction where I can move forward towards the key. Alternatively, turning right might not help because the forward path is blocked. 

Wait, in the previous steps, after turning right twice, the key came into view. Perhaps the best approach is to alternate turning left and right to navigate around the walls until I can face the direction of the key. 

Since the current walls are 2 forward and 3 left, turning left would make me face a direction where maybe there's a path forward towards the key. Let me check the previous steps again. After turning left from the position with walls 4 forward and 2 left, the observation changed to walls 4 forward and 2 left again, which doesn't make sense. Maybe there's a cycle here. 

Alternatively, maybe I need to go forward if possible. But the current observation says a wall 2 steps forward. So moving forward isn't an option. The next best action is to change direction. Since turning left previously helped reach the key's location, maybe turning left again here would be useful. 

Alternatively, maybe turning right again. Let's see: if I turn right from the current direction (with walls 2 forward and 3 left), my new direction would have a wall 2 steps left (since previous left was now the new right). Wait, directions can be confusing. Let me visualize it. 

Assuming the agent starts facing north. The first observation: wall 2 forward (north), wall 3 left (west). Turn right (now facing east). Next observation: wall 4 forward (east), wall 2 left (south). Turn right again (now facing south). Next observation: wall 5 forward (south), wall 3 right (west). Here, the blue key is 2 right (west) and 3 forward (south). So from this position, to get to the key, the agent would need to face west and move, but there's a wall 5 steps forward (south). So maybe they need to turn left (now facing east again?) Wait, directions are tricky. Let me try to track the agent's facing direction step by step.

Initial position: facing north.

1. Observation: wall 2 north, wall 3 west. Turn right (now facing east).
2. New observation: wall 4 east, wall 2 south. Turn right (now facing south).
3. New observation: wall 5 south, wall 3 west. Blue key is 2 west and 3 south. So from here, facing south, the key is 3 steps south and 2 steps west. But moving forward (south) would hit a wall. So turn left (now facing east). Then move forward? But maybe not. Alternatively, toggle isn't applicable here. Wait, in the third observation, the key is 2 steps right (west?) and 3 forward (south). So if facing south, right would be west. So to get to the key, need to go west 2 steps and south 3. But walls are blocking. So perhaps navigate around.

After turning left from facing south, now facing east. The next observation after that turn would be walls 4 forward (east) and 2 left (north). Then turning left again (facing north), observation is walls 2 forward (north) and 3 left (west). Which brings us back to the initial position. So it's a loop.

In the current observation, facing north again with walls 2 north and 3 west. The key is somewhere in another direction. Maybe the agent needs to find another way. But according to the previous steps, the key was found after turning right twice. But now, after looping back, the agent is stuck. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to pick up the key once it's in reach. But in the previous steps, the key was visible but perhaps not in the correct direction. Wait, in the third observation, the key was 2 steps right (west) and 3 forward (south). If the agent is facing south, moving right (west) would take them towards the key. But there's a wall 5 steps forward (south), so moving south isn't possible. So maybe the agent needs to turn left (now facing east) and then move forward? But in the previous step after turning left, the observation was walls 4 forward (east) and 2 left (north). So moving east would hit a wall. Hmm.

This seems like a maze with walls blocking the path. The agent needs to navigate around the walls to reach the key. Given the current observation, with walls 2 forward and 3 left (assuming facing north), the best action might be to turn right again to face east, which might open up a path. Alternatively, turning left to face west, but there's a wall 3 steps left (west) which is already a wall. 

Wait, in the current observation, walls are 2 steps forward (north) and 3 steps left (west). If the agent turns right (east), the next observation might have different walls. Let's assume turning right again and see what happens. If the agent turns right, now facing east. The previous step after turning right twice led to the key's location. So maybe turning right again here would help. 

In the previous cycle, turning right twice from facing north led to facing south, then west, then east again. Maybe continuing the pattern. So in the current state, turning right again (third time) would face south. Then maybe proceed. 

Alternatively, the agent might need to go forward if possible, but there's a wall. So the only options are to turn left or right. Since turning left led back to the initial position, perhaps turning right is the better option to break the loop and find a new path towards the key. 

Therefore, the chosen action is to turn right again.

Let's see what's going on here. The agent needs to get to the blue key. Looking at the current observation, there's a wall 4 steps forward and a wall 2 steps left. The previous observations show that the agent has been turning right and left, maybe navigating around the walls. The blue key was in a position that required moving right and forward, but now after some turns, the agent's orientation might have changed.

In the last move, the user turned right again, leading to the current observation. The walls are now blocking forward and left. The key is probably no longer in sight because the agent is facing a different direction. The agent needs to adjust its direction to face towards where the blue key was located. Since the key was 2 steps right and 3 steps forward before, maybe the agent should turn left to face that direction again. Alternatively, maybe another right turn could help reorient. But looking at the pattern, the agent kept turning right twice, then left, then right again, which might be going in a circle. The walls are indicating that the agent is moving in a corridor with walls on certain sides. To reach the key, the agent needs to move forward once it's correctly facing the direction where the key is. But since the current observation still has walls forward and left, maybe turning left again would allow the agent to face a direction where the key is no longer blocked by walls. Alternatively, maybe go forward if possible, but the observation says a wall is 4 steps forward. So turning is necessary. The best action here is probably to turn left again to change direction towards where the key might be accessible. Let me check the previous steps. Previously, after turning right, the agent saw a wall 4 steps forward. Then turning right again led to a wall 5 steps forward. Then turning left, but the key was visible. Now after another left turn, the walls are back to 4 forward and 2 left. Maybe the agent needs to turn right to face towards the key again. Hmm, perhaps the agent should alternate between turning right and left to navigate around the walls and eventually face the key's direction. Since the key is 2 right and 3 forward, the agent needs to face a direction where moving forward three steps and right two would reach it. But given the current walls, maybe turning left once more would allow moving forward towards the key's location. Alternatively, if the agent is facing north, and the key is to the east and north, but there's a wall blocking, then turning left (west?) might not help. This is a bit confusing. Maybe the agent should try turning right again to see if that changes the forward direction. But looking at the observation, turning right again would probably just cycle between the same wall distances. Alternatively, the agent could pick up or drop something, but there's no objects mentioned except the key, which is not currently in front. So the best bet is to keep turning to adjust direction until the agent is facing a path that leads towards the key. Since the previous steps involved turning right twice and left once, maybe turning right again would eventually face the key's direction. But the current observation shows walls in front and left, so perhaps a different approach is needed. Wait, in the last observation before the current one, the blue key was present, but now it's not. That suggests the agent might have moved away from the key's location. So the agent needs to reorient to face back towards where the key was. The key was 2 steps right and 3 steps forward, which might mean the agent needs to face northeast or something. Given that the walls are in certain directions, the agent should turn left to face a direction that allows moving towards where the key was. For example, if the agent was facing south and turned left to face west, then moving forward might not reach the key. Alternatively, if the agent turned left from facing north to face west, but walls are there. Hmm. This is tricky. Maybe the agent should turn left again to face a different direction and try moving forward. Even though there's a wall 4 steps forward, maybe after turning, the forward path is clear. But the current observation still says a wall 4 steps forward. So turning left again might not help. Alternatively, the agent could try going forward if possible, but since there's a wall, perhaps the only option is to turn. The agent needs to find a path that eventually leads to the key. Given the previous steps, maybe turning left again is the way to go, as it alternates directions and could eventually face the key's location. So the chosen action would be to turn left.

Let's see. The current observation says there's a wall 2 steps forward and another wall 3 steps left. The previous observations show that the agent was turning right and left alternately. The goal is to get to the blue key, which was mentioned earlier at a position 2 steps right and 3 steps forward.

Hmm. The agent's previous actions were turning right, then right again, then left, then left, right, left, right, left, right, left. Wait, maybe there's a pattern here. The walls are changing positions each time, so the agent is navigating around them. 

Looking at the latest observation, again walls are forward and left. The key's position might have changed or the agent might need to adjust direction. Since the walls are still blocking forward and left, turning right again could help the agent change direction to face a different path where the blue key might be accessible. 

But wait, in the earlier steps, after turning right, the agent might have moved forward towards the key. Now, if the walls are still blocking, maybe the agent needs to continue turning to find a clear path. Alternatively, if turning right again would allow the agent to face a direction where the key is no longer blocked by walls, that could be the way to go. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to go forward if possible. But the observation states a wall 2 steps forward, so going forward isn't an option. So the only possible actions are turning left or right. Since the agent was alternately turning to avoid walls, perhaps continuing that pattern by turning right again would help navigate around the obstacles. 

Another consideration: the agent might have been moving in a grid and needs to adjust its orientation to approach the key's location. If the key is 2 steps right and 3 forward, but there's a wall forward, maybe the agent needs to turn right to face a direction where it can move towards the key's coordinates step by step, avoiding walls. 

So, the best action here would be to turn right again to continue navigating around the walls towards the blue key's location.

7,Failed to obtain a valid action from the reasoning.,"<reasoning>
Let's try to figure out what the agent needs to do next. The goal is to get to the blue key. Let's look at the current observation:

There's a wall 4 steps forward and a wall 2 steps left. 

Previously, the agent had been turning right and left alternately. The last few steps showed that the agent was navigating around walls by turning directions. The blue key's location was mentioned in an earlier observation: 2 steps right and 3 steps forward. But now, after a series of turns and movements, the current positions of the walls might have changed, or the agent's orientation might have shifted.

Wait, the agent's orientation matters a lot here. Each turn left or right changes their facing direction. For example, if the agent was facing north, turning right would make them face east, then south, west, and back to north. So the sequence of turns and movements affects where the walls and the key are relative to the agent.

In the latest observations, after turning left or right multiple times, the agent is now facing a wall 4 steps forward and another wall 2 steps left. Suppose the agent is now facing north. The wall 4 steps forward would be north, and the wall 2 steps left would be west. But the key was previously 2 steps right and 3 steps forward. If the agent is facing north, right would be east. So 2 steps east and 3 steps north would be the key's location.

But now, the walls are in the way. The agent can't go forward 4 steps because there's a wall. The left direction (west) also has a wall 2 steps away. So the agent can't move straight forward or left. They need to find another direction to turn to proceed towards the key.

If the agent turns right (east), maybe there's a path. Let's see. If facing north and turning right (east), the walls would now be in the new directions. The forward direction would be east, and the left would be north. But the current observation mentions walls in forward (4 steps) and left (2 steps). Wait, after turning right, facing east, the forward direction is east, and left would be north. But the observation says a wall 4 steps forward (east) and a wall 2 steps left (north). So there's a wall blocking the way east, and a wall north. That doesn't help.

Alternatively, if the agent turns left again, facing west. Then forward would be west, and left would be south. But the observation says forward is 4 steps (west) and left is 2 steps (south). Still walls. Hmm. So turning left or right doesn't help. 

Wait, maybe the agent needs to move forward a little, but there's a wall. But going forward 4 steps is blocked. So perhaps the agent should try to maneuver around the walls in a different way. Since the key is 2 steps right and 3 forward, maybe the agent needs to adjust their orientation to face a direction where they can move towards those coordinates without hitting walls.

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to backtrack. But how? If the agent turned right multiple times, moving forward might not be possible. Let me think about the path the agent took so far.

Looking back at the previous steps:

1. Started with walls forward and left. Turned right.
2. Then walls forward 4, left 2. Turned right again.
3. Then walls forward 5, left 3, and saw the blue key 2 right and 3 forward. Turned left.
4. After that, walls forward 4, left 2. Turned left.
5. Then walls forward 2, left 3. Turned right.
6. Then walls forward 4, left 2. Turned left.
7. Now walls forward 2, left 3. Turned right again.
8. Current observation: walls forward 4, left 2.

This seems like the agent is moving in a pattern, maybe trying to circle around the walls but getting stuck. The key's position was mentioned earlier, but now the agent is facing a wall forward and left. 

Perhaps the agent needs to take a step forward, but it's blocked. So instead, they need to turn in a direction that allows them to move towards the key without hitting walls. Let's consider the key's location relative to the current position and orientation.

Assuming the agent's current direction is south (since after several turns, maybe they ended up facing south), then forward would be south, left would be east. But the observation says forward 4 steps is a wall. If the key was 2 steps right (west) and 3 steps forward (south), that would place it at (current position -2 west, -3 south). But with a wall 4 steps south, the agent can't go that way. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to adjust their orientation. If the agent turns left again, facing west, then forward is west, left is south. But there's a wall forward 4 steps (west). The key is 2 steps right (east) and 3 steps forward (west). Wait, that would be east from the agent's current position? No, if facing west, forward is west, right is south. So 2 steps right (south) and 3 steps forward (west) would be a position that's southwest from the agent. But the agent can't go west because of the wall. 

This is getting a bit confusing. Maybe the agent should try to move in a different direction. Since going forward is blocked, turning right or left to find a path. But according to the current observation, both turning right and left have walls nearby. Wait, no. The current observation says a wall 4 steps forward and 2 steps left. If the agent turns right, their new forward direction is east, which might have a wall 4 steps away. Their left would be north, which has a wall 2 steps. So turning right doesn't help. Turning left would make forward direction south, wall 4 steps, and left direction east, which is open? Wait, no, the observation after turning left would change. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent should drop whatever they're holding, but they weren't picking anything up yet. The blue key is the target. The agent needs to pick it up once they reach it. 

Another thought: perhaps the agent needs to move in a direction that aligns their path with the key's location. If the key is 2 steps right and 3 forward from an earlier position, but now the agent's path is blocked, they might need to navigate around the walls in a spiral or zig-zag pattern to eventually reach the key's location. 

But given the current observation, the agent is facing a wall 4 steps forward and 2 steps left. The only possible actions that don't immediately hit a wall would be to turn left or right, but both directions might still have walls. Wait, no. If the agent turns right, their forward direction is east, which has a wall 4 steps away. Their left direction (north) has a wall 2 steps. If they turn left, their forward direction is south, which has a wall 4 steps, and left is east, which might be open? But the observation doesn't mention a wall in the east direction. It only mentions forward and left. So maybe east is open. 

Wait, the current observation is: a wall 4 steps forward and a wall 2 steps left. The agent is facing a direction where forward is blocked by a wall 4 steps away, and left is blocked by a wall 2 steps. So if they turn left, their new forward direction would be the previous left direction minus 90 degrees. Let's say the agent is facing north. Original forward is north (4 steps wall), left is west (2 steps wall). Turning left (now facing west), forward is west (but the observation after turning left would have forward as west, but the original observation doesn't mention west. Wait, maybe the observation is relative to the agent's current orientation. So when the agent turns, their forward and left change accordingly. 

This is getting a bit complicated. Let's try to model the agent's orientation over time. 

Assuming the agent starts facing north. 

1. First action: turn right (now facing east).
   - Observation: wall 4 forward (east), wall 2 left (north).
   
2. Then turn right again (now facing south).
   - Observation: wall 5 forward (south), wall 3 left (east).

3. Then toggle? But no object in front. Then turn left (now facing west).
   - Observation: wall 4 forward (west), wall 2 left (south).

4. Turn left again (now facing north).
   - Observation: wall 2 forward (north), wall 3 left (west).

5. Turn right (now facing east).
   - Observation: wall 4 forward (east), wall 2 left (north).

6. Turn left (now facing north).
   - Observation: wall 2 forward (north), wall 3 left (west).

7. Turn right (now facing east).
   - Observation: wall 4 forward (east), wall 2 left (north).

8. Current observation: facing east, forward 4 steps wall, left 2 steps wall (north). 

Wait, but according to the latest observation, it's a wall 4 steps forward and 2 steps left. If the agent is facing east, forward is east (4 steps wall), left is north (2 steps wall). So the agent is stuck here. The key was previously at 2 steps right and 3 forward. If the agent was facing north earlier, right would be east. So 2 east and 3 north would be the key's location. But now, facing east, the key would be 2 steps south (left) and 3 steps west (backward). But the walls are blocking movement forward and left. 

In this situation, the agent can't move forward or left. The only possible actions are to turn left or right. Turning left would face south, forward would be south (4 steps wall), left would be east (unknown). If turning right, face west, forward west (4 steps wall), left south (2 steps). Either way, walls are blocking. 

But maybe the agent needs to move backward. Wait, there's no 'move backward' action; only 'go forward'. So the agent can't go back directly. However, if they turn around, they could face the opposite direction. For example, turning left twice would make them face west. Then forward would be west, but there's a wall 4 steps there. 

This seems like a dead end. Maybe the agent needs to look for a different path. Alternatively, perhaps the key's location has changed, but that's unlikely. 

Another possibility: the agent might have to move in a different sequence of turns and movements to eventually reach the key. For example, moving forward a few steps when possible, then turning to adjust direction. But given the current observation, moving forward is blocked. 

Wait, the agent's previous actions might have led them into this position. Maybe they need to backtrack by turning around and moving forward in the opposite direction. But how? Since moving forward is only possible in the current facing direction. 

If the agent turns left twice (180 degrees), they face west. Then forward would be west, which has a wall 4 steps away. Still blocked. 

Hmm. This is tricky. The agent might be stuck in a loop trying to navigate around the walls but not making progress towards the key. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to pick up an object, but there's no mention of any objects other than the blue key. The key is the only target. 

Wait, the key was previously 2 steps right and 3 forward. If the agent can align their path to move towards that location, avoiding walls. 

Assuming the agent is facing east now, and the key is 2 steps west (left) and 3 steps south (backward). But moving south is blocked by a wall. So maybe the agent needs to turn left to face south, but that's blocked. 

Alternatively, the agent could turn right to face west, then move forward, but that's blocked. 

This seems like a dead end. Maybe the agent needs to try a different sequence of turns to find a path. For example, turn right, then left, then right, etc., in an attempt to spiral around the walls. 

Given the current observation, the agent can't move forward or left, so the best options are to turn left or right. Turning left would face south, forward is south (4 steps wall), left is east (unknown). If there's no wall in east, the agent could move forward. But the observation doesn't mention an east wall. Wait, the current observation only states walls forward and left. So east might be open. 

If the agent turns left (now facing south), their left direction is east. If there's no wall east of the agent, they could move forward. But the observation doesn't specify, so maybe it's safe to assume that only the mentioned directions have walls. 

So, if the agent turns left (south), forward is south (4 steps wall), left is east. Since the observation doesn't mention a wall east, perhaps moving forward south is blocked, but moving east (left from south) might be possible. Wait, no. If facing south, left is east. Moving forward south is blocked, but moving east would require turning right? I'm getting confused. 

Alternatively, after turning left to face south, the agent's forward direction is south (wall), and their left is east. So the agent could try to go east by turning right (from facing south, turning right would face east), then move forward. But that's two actions: turn right and go forward. However, the current observation only allows one action per step. 

So the agent's options are to either turn left or right. Let's evaluate both:

1. Turn left (now facing south). Observation after turning: forward is south (4 steps wall), left is east (no wall mentioned). So the agent can't move forward, but east might be open. But since the action is to choose between turn left, right, go forward, etc., the agent can't move east directly unless they turn right first. 

2. Turn right (now facing west). Forward is west (4 steps wall), left is south (2 steps wall). Still blocked. 

So neither turning left nor right helps. The only possible actions are to turn or go forward (which is blocked). 

Wait, but the agent must choose an action. The 'go forward' action is blocked, so the agent can't do that. The 'drop' or 'pick up' actions don't make sense here since there's no object mentioned. 

The only viable actions are to turn left or right. Since both directions might not help, but perhaps turning left again could change the agent's orientation to face a direction where movement is possible. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to keep turning right to eventually circle around the walls. For example, turning right when stuck can help navigate around obstacles. 

In the previous steps, the agent alternated between turning right and left. Maybe continuing that pattern could eventually lead them to the key. 

Given that the current observation is walls forward and left, turning right again would face west, forward west (4 steps wall), left south (2 steps). Still blocked. 

This is a problem. The agent seems to be stuck in a loop. Maybe there's a mistake in the path taken earlier. 

Alternatively, perhaps the agent needs to move forward a small number of steps when possible, but in the current observation, moving forward 4 steps is blocked. 

Wait, the 'go forward' action takes one step, not four. So the agent can try to move one step forward, even if there's a wall further ahead. But does the game allow moving into a wall? Probably not; the 'go forward' action would only succeed if there's no wall immediately in front. 

But the observation says a wall is 4 steps forward. That implies that one step forward is clear, but beyond that, there's a wall. So the agent can move one step forward. 

Wait, that's a possibility. The observation states the distance to the wall, but the agent can move one step at a time. So even if there's a wall 4 steps away, the agent can move forward one step, then check again. 

But in the current observation, the agent is facing a wall 4 steps forward. So moving one step forward would be possible, but after that, there's still a wall 3 steps away. But maybe the agent can navigate through the corridors created by the walls. 

However, in the current state, the agent's observation doesn't mention any objects other than the walls. The key's location was mentioned earlier but not in the latest observations. So the agent might have moved away from the key. 

This is getting really complicated. Maybe the best approach here is to continue turning right in an attempt to circle around the walls and eventually find a path to the key. Even though the previous turns didn't lead anywhere, perhaps a different sequence will. 

So, the chosen action would be to turn right again. But wait, the user's latest observation is:

Current Observation:
a wall 4 steps forward
a wall 2 steps left

The agent's previous action was turn right, leading to this observation. Now, again, the agent is facing a wall 4 steps forward and 2 steps left. The only options are to turn left or right. 

If the agent turns right again, they'll face west, forward 4 steps wall, left 2 steps south. Still blocked. 

Alternatively, turning left would face south, forward 4 steps wall, left 2 steps east. Still blocked. 

So neither direction helps. The agent is stuck. However, the problem states that the agent should not repeat the same action over and over if the observation doesn't change. 

In this case, turning right repeatedly isn't helping, and the observation remains the same. So the agent needs to try a different action. The only other action that makes sense is to go forward, but it's blocked. 

Wait, but 'go forward' is an action. Even if there's a wall further ahead, maybe the agent can move one step forward. Let's check. 

If the agent tries 'go forward', they would move one step. But the observation says a wall is 4 steps forward. That suggests that after one step, there's no wall, but after that, there is. So moving forward one step is possible. 

But would that help the agent? Let's say the agent moves forward one step, then turns around or adjusts direction. 

But the problem is that the agent's current observation doesn't mention any objects other than walls, so moving forward might reveal new information. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent should try to drop something, but they aren't holding anything. 

This is a tricky situation. Given the constraints, the only viable actions are to turn left or right. Since neither seems to help, but the agent can't move forward, perhaps the best choice is to keep alternating turns to try to find a path. 

But the tip says not to repeat the same action over and over. The agent has been turning right and left alternately, which might not","

Your previous output did not contain a valid action. Defaulted to action: go forward

8,turn right,"<reasoning>
I need to get to the blue key. Let me look at the current observation. There's a wall 3 steps forward and another wall 2 steps left. The previous actions were turning right and left, but maybe that's not working.

Wait, the blue key was mentioned in one of the earlier observations. But now I'm back to walls in front and left. Maybe I'm circling around. Let me check the path again. If there's a wall in front, going forward isn't an option. The walls are to the left and forward. So perhaps I need to turn again. Previously, I turned left and right alternately, but maybe that's not leading me towards the key.

Alternatively, maybe I should check if there's another direction. If the walls are left and forward, maybe turning right would face me a new direction. Let's see. If I turn right, then the wall that was to my left is now behind me, and the wall in front is still there. Wait, but turning right would change my facing direction. Let me visualize this.

If I'm facing north, and there's a wall forward (north) and a wall to the left (west), turning right would make me face east. Then, the wall that was to my left (west) is now behind me, and the wall forward (north) is still there. But maybe in this new direction, there's a path. However, the current observation only shows walls in front and left, so turning right might not help. 

Alternatively, if I turn left again, that would make me face west. But the wall to the left was already there, so maybe that's the same as before. Hmm. Since I can't go forward because of the wall, maybe I need to adjust my direction to find a path. Since the blue key was previously 2 steps right and 3 forward, maybe I need to face a direction where that path exists. 

Wait, but in the current observation, the walls are blocking forward and left. Perhaps I need to backtrack. If I turn around, maybe that's possible. If I turn right twice, that would make me face south. Then, maybe there's a path south. But the current observation doesn't mention anything behind me. 

Alternatively, maybe I should check if the toggle action is needed. But toggle is for manipulating objects in front, which are walls here, so that's not useful. The key is somewhere else, so I need to navigate to it. 

Given that I can't go forward or left, turning right or left might not change the walls, but perhaps I need to try a different direction. Wait, the previous actions were turning right and left alternately, leading to these same walls. Maybe I need to try another sequence. For example, turn right, then go forward if possible. But in the current observation, after turning right, the forward path is still blocked. 

Alternatively, maybe I need to drop something if I'm holding something, but the problem states the goal is to get the blue key, so I probably don't have anything to drop. 

Wait, perhaps I should retrace my steps. The last valid action was ""turn right"" leading to the current observation. But that might not be the right path. Maybe I need to try a different initial direction. 

Alternatively, maybe the key is in a different location now, but according to previous observations, it was 2 steps right and 3 forward. So if I adjust my direction to face east, then moving right would be south or something? This is getting confusing. 

Alternatively, maybe I should use the go forward action even though there's a wall, but the observation says there's a wall 3 steps forward, so that's not possible. The valid actions are turn left, turn right, go forward (but blocked), pick up (nothing there), drop (nothing holding), toggle (wall). So the only possible actions are turn left or turn right. 

Since the user's previous actions alternated between left and right, leading to the same walls, maybe there's a pattern here. The walls are changing positions slightly each time, like 2 steps forward, then 4, then 5, etc. But maybe the key is in a specific location that requires a particular path. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to keep turning in one direction until a path opens up. For example, turning right repeatedly might eventually face a direction where the key is accessible. Let me think: if I turn right three times, I'd be facing the original direction's opposite. But if the key is in a specific location, this might not help. 

Alternatively, perhaps the agent should alternate between turning and moving in a certain way. But given the current observation, moving forward is blocked. 

Hmm. The only valid actions are turn left or right. Since the previous actions led to the same pattern, maybe the agent should try turning left again. Wait, in the current observation, walls are 3 steps forward and 2 steps left. If I turn left, facing west, then the wall to the left (which was north?) Wait, directions are confusing. Let me represent this as a coordinate system. 

Assume the agent starts facing north. 

Initial observation: wall 2 steps forward (north), wall 3 steps left (west). 

First action: turn right (now facing east). 

Next observation: wall 4 steps forward (east), wall 2 steps left (south). 

Then turn right (now facing south). 

Observation: wall 5 steps forward (south), wall 3 steps right (east). Blue key 2 right and 3 forward. 

At that point, turning left would face west. Then observation shows wall 4 forward (west), wall 2 left (south). 

This seems like the agent is moving in a cycle, changing directions but hitting walls. 

The key was previously at 2 steps right and 3 forward. If the agent was facing east, then right would be south, forward would be east. So 2 steps right (south) and 3 forward (east) would place the key at (east 3, south 2) from the agent's position. But if the agent is facing south, then right is west, forward is south. So 2 steps right (west) and 3 forward (south) would be further south and west. 

This is getting complicated. Maybe the agent needs to adjust its direction to align with the key's position. 

Alternatively, the agent might need to move in a different pattern. Since going forward is blocked, perhaps turning right and then moving in a different direction. But without knowing the map layout, it's hard to say. 

Given the current observation (walls 3 forward and 2 left), the only possible actions are turn left or right. Since previous alternation didn't help, maybe try turning right again. Wait, but the user's previous actions were turning right, left, right, etc., and the observation walls changed steps but directionally similar. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent should try to go around the wall by moving in a perpendicular direction. For example, if there's a wall to the left, turning right (facing east) and then moving forward if possible. But in the previous steps, that led to walls as well. 

Wait, in the observation after turning right three times, the blue key was mentioned, but now it's not in the current observation. Maybe the agent moved away from it. 

Alternatively, perhaps the agent needs to pick up the key once it's in front, but the key isn't in the current observation. 

Given all this, the only valid actions are turn left or right. Since the agent is stuck in a loop, maybe randomly choosing one, but the tips say not to repeat the same action unless necessary. 

But in the current observation, the walls are 3 forward and 2 left. If I turn right, the new direction would face east. Then the wall in front would be 4 steps (from previous observation), but current observation says 3 steps forward. Wait, no, the current observation is after turning left, leading to walls 3 forward and 2 left. 

Hmm. Maybe the best action is to turn left again, hoping to face a direction where the key is accessible. Or turn right. 

Alternatively, since the key was previously 2 steps right and 3 forward, maybe the agent needs to face a direction where moving right and forward gets there. For example, if facing north, right is east, so moving right (east) 2 steps and forward (north) 3 steps. But that would require the agent to be facing north. However, current observation has walls 3 forward (north) and 2 left (west). 

If the agent turns right (east), then the forward direction is east, which has a wall 4 steps away. Left would be south. So not helpful. 

Alternatively, if the agent turns left (west), forward is north (wall), left is south (wall). Still stuck. 

This is tricky. Maybe the agent needs to keep turning right to eventually face a direction where the key is. But without knowing the map, it's hard. 

Alternatively, since the key was last seen at 2 right and 3 forward, perhaps the agent should adjust its direction to align those vectors. For example, if the agent faces east, then right is south, and forward is east. So 2 steps right (south) and 3 forward (east) would place the key at (east 3, south 2). But if the agent is facing east and moves forward 3 steps, but there's a wall 4 steps forward, that's not possible. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent should try to go around the wall by moving perpendicular. For example, if there's a wall to the left (west), turn right (east) and try to move forward around the wall. But the wall in front is east, 4 steps away. 

I think I'm stuck here. The only valid actions are turn left or right. Since the previous actions alternated between them without progress, maybe try turning right again. Or perhaps the agent should drop something, but it's not holding anything. 

Wait, the problem says the goal is to get the blue key. The key was in an earlier observation, but now it's not present. Maybe the agent moved away from it. So the agent needs to retrace steps or find a new path. 

Given that, perhaps turning right again to change direction and look for a new path. So the chosen action would be turn right.

Let's try to figure this out. The goal is to get the blue key. The current observation says there's a wall 5 steps forward, a wall 3 steps left, and the blue key is 3 steps right and 3 steps forward.

First, I need to figure out where the agent is facing right now. From the previous observations, the agent was turning left and right to navigate around walls. Let's recap the history:

- The agent turned right multiple times when facing walls in front and left.
- Sometimes after turning left, there were walls in front again, leading to another right turn.
- The last few observations kept alternating between walls forward and left, requiring the agent to turn right or left to change direction.

Now, the latest observation has the blue key 3 steps right and 3 steps forward. To reach that key, the agent needs to move in a direction that aligns with those coordinates. Let's assume the agent's current facing direction is critical here. 

If the agent is currently facing north, then ""3 steps right"" would mean turning east, and ""3 steps forward"" would be north. But given the previous turns, maybe the agent is facing east. Let's think: if the agent turned right several times, each right turn would change direction clockwise. For example, starting facing north, a right turn makes east, another right turn south, etc. But the exact sequence might not be clear without tracking each step. However, the key is to figure out the direction needed to get to the key's position.

The blue key is 3 steps right and 3 forward. So, relative to the agent's current position and facing direction, those steps must be translated into an action. If the agent needs to go right (east) and then forward (north), then if the agent is facing north, turning right (east) and then going forward three times would reach the key's x-coordinate, then another three steps forward. But the observation mentions the key is 3 steps right and 3 forward, which might mean in the agent's current orientation, right is east and forward is north. 

Wait, but in the current observation, there's a wall 5 steps forward. So if the agent is facing north, moving forward 5 steps brings them to a wall. But the key is 3 forward (north) and 3 right (east). So maybe the agent needs to turn right to face east, then go forward 3 steps to get to the key's x-coordinate, then turn north (another right turn?) and go forward 3 more steps. But the problem is that the agent can't move diagonally. So they have to move in two directions: first east, then north.

Alternatively, if the agent is facing east, then going forward would be east, but the key is 3 right (south) and 3 forward (east). That doesn't make sense. Hmm. Maybe I need to consider the agent's current facing direction based on the previous actions. The agent has been turning right and left to navigate around walls. Let's try to reconstruct the possible directions.

Suppose the agent starts facing north. First observation: wall 2 forward, wall 3 left. So left is west. The agent turns right (now facing east). Next observation: wall 4 forward, wall 2 left. Left would now be south. Turn right again (south). Next observation: wall 5 forward, wall 3 right. Right would be west. Turn left (now facing north again). Next observation: wall 4 forward, wall 2 left. Left is west. Turn left again (south). And so on. This might not be accurate, but it's getting complicated. 

Alternatively, perhaps the agent is moving in a pattern where they are circling around the walls. The key is at 3 right and 3 forward. If the agent needs to get there, they might need to adjust their direction to face the key's position. If the current facing is such that right is the direction towards the key's x-coordinate, then turning right and moving forward could get closer. 

Wait, the key is 3 steps right and 3 steps forward. So from the agent's current position, if they turn right, then go forward three times, and then turn right again and go forward three times, they would reach the key. But they need to check if there are walls in those paths. However, the current observation only shows walls 5 steps forward and 3 left, so maybe the path is clear in the required direction. 

Alternatively, the agent might need to first turn right to face east, then go forward three steps (since the key is 3 right, which would be east), and then from there, turn north (another right turn) and go forward three steps. But if moving forward 5 steps is blocked by a wall, perhaps the agent can't go straight north, so they need to adjust their path. 

But the observation now says the key is 3 right and 3 forward. So the agent's current direction must be such that turning right and moving forward gets them closer. Let's assume the agent is facing north. Then turning right would face east. Moving forward three steps (east) would align them with the key's x-coordinate (3 right), and then moving forward three steps north would reach the key. However, the observation mentions a wall 5 steps forward. If facing north, moving forward five steps hits a wall, which suggests that the key's forward direction (north) is not blocked immediately. Wait, but the key is 3 steps forward from the agent's current position. So maybe the agent is two steps away from the wall. For example, if facing north, there's a wall at 5 steps forward, so the agent is two steps away from the wall. Then moving forward three steps would get to the key, which is three steps forward. But that would require passing through the wall's position, which is at five steps. Wait, that doesn't add up. If the wall is five steps forward, the agent can't move five steps forward. So the key must be within three steps forward, but the observation says the wall is five steps forward. That suggests that the key is somewhere in front, but not beyond the wall. Maybe the wall is blocking a different path. 

This is getting a bit confusing. Perhaps the agent needs to first turn right to face a direction where moving forward three steps gets them to the key's x-coordinate, and then adjust forward from there. Let's look at the key's position: 3 steps right and 3 forward. So relative to the agent's current position, if they turn right (east) and move three steps forward, they would be at the key's x-coordinate. Then, from there, they need to move three steps forward in whatever direction that is. But if the agent is facing east, moving three steps forward would take them east, but the key is three steps right (east) and three forward (north). So after moving east three steps, they need to turn north (another right turn) and move three steps forward. However, the current observation says there's a wall five steps forward. If the agent is facing east, moving five steps forward would hit a wall, but the key is three steps north from their current position. Wait, this is getting too tangled. 

Perhaps the best approach is to look at the key's position and figure out the direction the agent needs to face to get there. If the key is 3 right and 3 forward, the agent needs to move in a direction that combines right and forward. But movement is only allowed in straight lines. So the agent can't move diagonally; they have to move right then forward, or forward then right. 

Assuming the agent is facing north, turning right (east) and moving forward three steps would align them with the key's x-coordinate. Then, turning north (another right turn) and moving forward three steps would reach the key. But if facing north, moving forward five steps is blocked by a wall. So the agent can't go straight north five steps, but the key is only three steps forward. That suggests that the wall is beyond the key's position. So the agent can move three steps north (forward) to reach the key. But why does the observation say the wall is five steps forward? Maybe the wall is in a different direction. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent is facing a different direction. Let's say the agent is facing east. Then, moving three steps right would be south, which doesn't make sense. Wait, right and left are relative to the agent's facing direction. So if the agent is facing east, turning right would face south, and left would face north. 

Given the complexity, perhaps the safest action is to turn right to face a direction where moving forward three steps would get closer to the key. Since the key is 3 right and 3 forward, turning right and moving forward three steps would get the agent to the correct x-coordinate, then they can adjust their direction to face north and move forward. But given the wall's presence, they have to ensure there's no wall in the path. 

Alternatively, the agent could try to go forward three steps if possible, but the observation mentions a wall five steps forward. If the agent is two steps away from the wall, moving three steps forward would hit the wall. So they can't move forward directly. Therefore, they need to turn right or left to avoid the wall and get to the key's position. 

Looking at the current observation: walls at 5 forward and 3 left. The key is 3 right and 3 forward. So if the agent turns right, their new direction would be such that moving forward three steps would take them to the key's position (since right is east and forward is north, but need to check coordinates). Alternatively, turning left might not help. 

Wait, the key is 3 steps right and 3 forward. So if the agent turns right, then their forward direction is now east (assuming they were facing north before). Moving three steps forward east would align them with the key's x-coordinate. Then, they need to move three steps north (which would be a left turn from facing east). But how do they get there? After turning right and moving east three steps, they would be at the key's x-coordinate. Then, they need to turn north (left) and move three steps forward. But the current observation doesn't mention any walls in that direction, only that there's a wall five steps forward in the original direction. 

However, the agent's current observation after turning right might have different wall positions. But based on the given observation, the walls are still 5 steps forward and 3 left. Wait, no—the current observation is the one provided now: a wall 5 steps forward, wall 3 steps left, and blue key 3 right and 3 forward. So regardless of previous turns, the walls are in those positions. 

So the agent is currently facing a direction where forward is blocked by a wall at 5 steps, left is blocked by a wall at 3 steps, and the key is 3 right and 3 forward. So to reach the key, the agent needs to turn right (to face a direction where moving forward three steps reaches the key's x-coordinate), then move forward. But after turning right, the forward direction would be different. Let's clarify:

If the agent turns right, their new forward direction is to the east (assuming they were facing north). Moving three steps forward east would take them to the key's x-coordinate (3 right). Then, they need to move three steps north (which would be a left turn from facing east). But how do they get north? After turning right and moving east three steps, they would be at the key's x-coordinate. Then, they need to face north and move three steps. But how to face north again? They would have to turn left from facing east (turning left twice would face north?), no. Wait, turning right once from north faces east. Turning left from east faces north. So yes, after moving east three steps, turning left (north) and moving three steps forward would reach the key. 

But the problem is that the current observation doesn't provide information about walls in those new directions after turning. The agent can't see past the immediate walls. However, the key is in the position that the agent needs to reach, so assuming that the path to the key is clear (since the key is there), the agent can proceed. 

So the steps would be: turn right to face east, move forward three steps (reaching the key's x-coordinate), then turn left (north) and move forward three steps to reach the key. However, the agent can only move one step at a time. So the first action should be to turn right to face the correct direction, then go forward. 

Given that the key is 3 steps right and 3 forward, turning right and moving forward once would get the agent one step closer in the right direction. Repeating this three times would get them to the key's x-coordinate, then turning left and moving forward three times. But since the agent can only take one action at a time, the first action should be to turn right, then go forward. 

But the current observation shows a wall five steps forward. If the agent is facing north, turning right would face east, and moving forward five steps would hit a wall. Wait, but the key is only three steps forward in the original direction. If the agent is facing north, the key is three steps north (forward), and the wall is five steps north. So moving three steps forward north would reach the key before hitting the wall. But the observation says there's a wall five steps forward, which is in the same direction as the key. That suggests that the wall is beyond the key's position. Therefore, the path to the key is clear. 

Wait, this is confusing. If the agent is facing north, and the wall is five steps forward, that means moving five steps north hits a wall. But the key is three steps north. So the key is three steps north, and beyond that is two more steps to the wall. Therefore, the path to the key is clear. So the agent can move forward three steps to reach the key. But why isn't that the case? Because the key is in front of the agent. 

Wait, the key's position is 3 steps right and 3 forward. If the agent is facing north, then ""right"" would be east, and ""forward"" would be north. So the key is three steps east and three steps north from the agent's current position. That means the agent needs to move east three steps and then north three steps. But since movement is linear, the agent has to do this in two steps: first move east three steps, then turn north and move three steps. 

But the current observation says there's a wall five steps forward. If the agent is facing north, moving five steps forward would hit the wall, but the key is only three steps forward. So moving three steps forward north would reach the key. But the problem is that the key is also three steps to the right (east). So the agent needs to move east three steps and then north three steps. 

But how to do that? The agent can't move diagonally. So first, they need to turn right (east) and move three steps forward to the key's x-coordinate. Then, turn left (north) and move three steps forward to reach the key. 

But in the current observation, after turning right, the agent's new forward direction is east, and the wall is five steps forward in the original direction (north). So moving east three steps would be clear, as there's no wall mentioned in that direction. The wall is five steps north, not east. Therefore, the agent can safely move east three steps. 

So the correct action would be to turn right, then go forward. But the agent needs to do this step by step. The first action should be to turn right to face the correct direction, then go forward. 

Looking at the previous actions, the agent has been turning right and left to navigate around walls. The latest observation after several turns has the key in position. Therefore, the next logical step is to turn right to face east, then move forward three times. But the agent can only take one action at a time. 

In the current observation, the agent sees the key at 3 right and 3 forward. The walls are five steps forward (in the current facing direction) and three steps left. So the agent must be facing a direction where forward is blocked by a wall at five steps, left is blocked at three steps. The key is in a position that requires moving right and forward. 

Assuming the agent is facing north, turning right (east) and moving forward three steps would get them to the key's x-coordinate. Then turning left (north) and moving three steps forward would reach the key. 

But the current observation doesn't indicate any walls in the east direction. The wall is five steps forward (north) and three left (west). So moving east three steps should be possible. 

Therefore, the first action should be to turn right to face east, then go forward. However, the agent needs to confirm the direction. 

In the current observation, after turning right multiple times, the agent's facing direction is likely east or another direction. But without knowing the exact facing direction, it's challenging. However, based on the key's position, the best bet is to turn right to align with the east direction and move forward. 

So the chosen action should be to turn right, then go forward. But since the agent can only take one action at a time, the immediate action is to turn right to face the correct direction. Then, the next action would be to go forward. 

Given that the agent's goal is to get to the blue key, and the key is 3 steps right and 3 forward, the optimal path is to adjust direction to face east, move three steps forward, then face north and move three steps. But since the agent can only take one action per turn, the first step is to turn right. 

Therefore, the correct action now is to turn right.

 <sep> human:","a wall 4 steps forward
a wall 2 steps right
a blue key 3 steps left and 3 steps forward",0,False
10,turn left,"<reasoning>
Let me try to figure out what I need to do here. The goal is to get the blue key. Let me look at the current observation.

The observation says there's a wall 4 steps forward, a wall 2 steps to the right, and the blue key is 3 steps left and 3 steps forward. Hmm. Wait, so my current direction must be such that moving forward 4 steps hits a wall, and moving right 2 steps also hits a wall. The key is somewhere to the left and forward from my current position.

First, I need to figure out my direction. If moving forward 4 steps is a wall, maybe I'm facing a direction where forward is blocked. The key is 3 steps left and 3 steps forward. So if I'm facing, say, north, then left would be west, and forward would still be north. But the walls are 4 steps forward (north) and 2 steps right (east). That makes sense. So if I'm facing north, the key is 3 steps west (left) and 3 steps north (forward). So the key's position is northwest relative to me.

But wait, how do I get there? Let's break it down. From my current position, to reach the key, I need to go left (west) 3 steps and forward (north) 3 steps. But the wall is 4 steps forward, so if I try to go north 3 steps, that's possible, but if there's a wall at 4 steps, maybe after 3 steps it's still open. Wait, the observation says ""a wall 4 steps forward"", which probably means that if I keep going forward beyond 3 steps, there's a wall. So moving forward 3 steps would be okay, then turning left (west) and moving 3 steps. But the observation also mentions a wall 2 steps to the right. If I'm facing north, right is east, so moving east 2 steps hits a wall. So I can't go east. 

So my current direction is north. The key is northwest. So from here, possible actions: I can turn left (west) or right (east), but east is blocked. Turning left (west) would face me west. Then maybe go forward? But how many steps? The key is 3 steps west and 3 steps north. If I turn left (west), then go forward, that's the west direction. But how far? The observation doesn't specify walls in other directions except forward and right. Wait, the observation lists ""a wall 4 steps forward"" and ""a wall 2 steps right"". So when facing north, forward is north (blocked at 4 steps), right is east (blocked at 2 steps). But what about left (west) and backwards (south)? The observation doesn't mention walls there, so maybe those directions are open. 

So my plan: Turn left (west) to face west. Then go forward some steps. But how many? The key is 3 steps left (west) and 3 steps forward (north). If I face west, the key is 3 steps north-west? Wait, no. If I'm facing west, then moving forward would be west. The key's position relative to me when facing west would be 3 steps north-west. But I need to adjust. Wait, maybe I need to first turn to face a direction that allows me to approach the key. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe turn around. If I turn right twice (180 degrees), facing south. Then the wall that was north is now behind me. The wall to the right (east) would be south? Wait, no. If I'm facing north, right is east. If I turn right again (second right), I'm facing south. Now, forward would be south. The observation doesn't mention walls in south direction, so maybe I can move south. But how does that help? The key is 3 steps left (west) and 3 steps forward (north) from original position. If I go south, that's away from the key. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe turn left (west) and then go forward. But how many steps? If I face west, moving forward would take me west. The key is 3 steps west (left from original position) and 3 steps forward (north). So from facing west, the key is 3 steps north-west. That would require turning north from west, but I can't do that by moving forward west. Maybe I need to adjust my direction first.

Wait, perhaps I should first turn to face north-west direction. But the available actions are only turn left, right, go forward, etc. So each turn changes my direction by 90 degrees. Let's think: current direction is north. To face north-west, I need to turn left (west) then left again (south). But that would be 180 degrees from north, facing south. No, that's not north-west. Alternatively, turn right twice (east then south), but that's also not north-west. Hmm. Maybe the key is located such that approaching it requires moving in a direction that's a combination of left and forward.

Alternatively, maybe after turning left (west), then go forward 3 steps. But the key is 3 steps west and 3 steps north. If I go west 3 steps, then turn north? But how? Turning north from west would require turning right (east) then left (north). Wait, this is getting complicated. Let's map it out.

Original position: facing north. Key is at (-3, 3) if I consider current position as (0,0). Walls are at 4 steps forward (north: y=4 is a wall), and 2 steps right (east: x=2 is a wall). So map:

(0,0) - current position.

Moving north (forward) 4 steps hits a wall.

Moving east (right) 2 steps hits a wall.

So possible open paths: south, west, and beyond.

The key is at (-3, 3). So from current position, to get there, need to go west 3 steps and north 3 steps. But since moving north is blocked beyond 3 steps, maybe after moving west 3 steps, then moving north 3 steps is possible? Wait, the observation only mentions walls 4 steps forward (north) from the original position. If I move west 3 steps, then my new position is (-3, 0). From there, moving north 3 steps would take me to (-3, 3), which is the key's location. But is there a wall at (-3, 3) north? The original observation doesn't mention walls beyond the initial ones. So maybe that's possible.

So steps:

1. Turn left (west).

2. Go forward 3 steps to reach (-3, 0).

3. Turn left again (now facing north).

4. Go forward 3 steps to reach (-3, 3), which is the key.

But how do I know there are no walls in between? The observations provided don't mention walls in those directions, except the initial ones. So assuming that moving west 3 steps is possible (no wall in between), then this path works.

Alternatively, maybe there's a more efficient path. Let's see the current observation again: the blue key is 3 steps left and 3 steps forward. If I'm facing north, left is west, forward is north. So the key is northwest. To get there, I could turn left (west) and go forward, but that would take me west, then I need to go north. But how?

Wait, perhaps after turning left (west), I can't go north directly because my direction is west. So to go north, I need to turn left again ( north). But turning left from west would face me north. Then go forward. So steps:

1. Turn left (west).

2. Turn left again (north).

3. Go forward 3 steps.

But that would make me face north again, but I was already facing north originally. Wait, no. Original direction: north. Turn left once: west. Turn left again: south. No, that's not right. Wait, directions when turning left:

If facing north, turn left → west.

Turn left again → south.

Turn left again → east.

Turn left again → north.

So to face north again after facing west, you need to turn left three times (west → south → east → north). That's not efficient.

Alternatively, turn right from west: facing east. Then left again to face north. Hmm.

This is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to visualize.

Alternatively, maybe the best action right now is to turn left (west) to face that direction and then move forward towards the key. But how many steps? The key is 3 steps left and 3 steps forward from the original position. If I face west, then moving forward would be west, but the key is also 3 steps north from the original position. So after moving west 3 steps, I need to move north 3 steps. But once I'm facing west, how do I move north? I need to turn north, which requires turning left (from west, turn left to face north). Then go forward.

So the sequence would be:

1. Turn left (west).

2. Go forward 3 steps (to reach (-3, 0)).

3. Turn left (north).

4. Go forward 3 steps (to reach (-3, 3)).

But how do I know there are no walls in those steps? The observation mentions walls only 4 steps forward (north) and 2 steps right (east). Once I turn west, there's no mention of walls in that direction, so assuming it's clear. Similarly, after moving west 3 steps and turning north, moving 3 steps forward should reach the key.

But in the current observation, after turning left (west), the next observation would depend on the game's state. However, the user hasn't provided the next observations after each action, so I have to assume based on the given info.

Given that, the immediate action needed is to start moving towards the key. The key is 3 steps left (west) and 3 steps forward (north). So the optimal path is to face west, move west, then face north and move north. But since each turn is 90 degrees, turning left twice would face south, which is not helpful. Alternatively, turn right once (east), but that's blocked. So the only viable turn is left (west).

Therefore, the first action should be to turn left (west) to begin heading in the correct general direction towards the key.

Let's see. The current observation is that there's a wall 5 steps forward, a wall 3 steps left, and a blue key located 3 steps right and 3 steps forward.

So the agent needs to reach the blue key. Let me visualize the surroundings. The agent is facing some direction. The walls are blocking forward and left. The key is to the right and ahead. 

Looking back at the previous steps, the agent has been turning right and left to navigate around the walls. Last time, they turned right, and then the key was detected in a different position. Now, the key is 3 steps right and 3 forward. Since there's a wall 5 steps forward, the agent can't go straight ahead. The key is to the right, so maybe turning right would align the agent to head towards it. But wait, after turning right, the path forward might not be blocked anymore. Alternatively, if the agent turns left, but there's a wall 3 steps left, so that's not helpful. 

Previously, when the agent turned right, they might have adjusted their direction to face a path where they can move forward towards the key. The key's position is 3 steps right and 3 forward. If the agent turns right, they would be facing a direction where moving forward 3 steps would get them closer to the key's forward component, and then adjusting right again. But need to check if the direction after turning right allows moving towards the key. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent should first turn left to face a different direction, but the left has a wall 3 steps away, so that might not help. The best bet seems to be turning right to face a direction where they can move forward towards the key's location. Since the key is 3 steps right and 3 forward, after turning right, moving forward 3 steps would align with the key's forward, and then turning right again to get the right component. Wait, that might not be the case. Maybe after turning right, the forward direction is now where the key is 3 forward and 3 right. Hmm, perhaps the agent needs to first turn right to face east (assuming initial direction is north), then move forward 3 steps to get the forward component, then turn right again to face south and move 3 steps right. But the key's position is 3 right and 3 forward from the current position. If the agent turns right, their new forward direction is east. Moving forward 3 steps would get them 3 steps east, which covers the forward part of the key's position. Then, they need to go 3 steps right (which would be south direction). But that might require another turn. Alternatively, after turning right, moving forward 3 steps would position them at the key's forward location, and then turning right again (now facing south) and moving 3 steps right (south) would reach the key. 

But the agent hasn't picked up the key yet. So the next action should be to move towards the key. Since moving forward is blocked by a wall, the agent must adjust their direction. Turning right seems necessary to face a path where they can move forward towards the key. So the chosen action should be 'turn right' again to face the correct direction, then move forward. But in the current observation, after turning right, moving forward might be possible if the wall is no longer in the way. Wait, the current observation says there's a wall 5 steps forward, but that's in the current facing direction. If the agent turns right, their new forward direction might not have a wall. Let me check the previous steps. Earlier, when the agent turned right, the wall distances changed. For example, after turning right once, the wall forward distance increased. So perhaps turning right again would align the agent to a direction where moving forward is possible towards the key. 

Therefore, the best action here is to turn right to face the direction where the key is located, allowing the agent to move forward towards it once the path is clear.

 <sep> human:","a wall 4 steps forward
a wall 2 steps right
a blue key 3 steps left and 3 steps forward",0,False
12,turn left,"<reasoning>
Let's tackle this step by step. The current observation shows that there's a wall 4 steps forward and another wall 2 steps to the right. The blue key is located 3 steps left and 3 steps forward.

First, I need to figure out the agent's current direction. Previous actions might have oriented the agent properly. Let me recap the history: the agent was turning right and left, trying to navigate around the walls. 

In the latest observation before this one, the agent was facing a wall 4 steps forward and a wall 2 steps right. The key was 3 steps left and 3 forward. The agent turned left, which likely changed their facing direction. 

Now, the walls have adjusted positions. The wall forward is now 4 steps, and the wall to the right is 2 steps. The key's position is 3 steps left and 3 forward again. 

I need to determine the agent's direction. Suppose after turning left from the previous step, the agent is now facing a direction where moving forward would reduce the distance to the key. Let's assume the agent is now facing north. Then, moving left would be west, right would be east. 

If the key is 3 steps left (west) and 3 forward (north), the agent needs to go west 3 steps and then north 3 steps. But there's a wall 4 steps forward (north), so they can't go straight. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent should adjust their direction to face a direction where they can approach the key without hitting walls. Let's think: if the agent turns right again, they might face a direction where moving forward isn't blocked. 

Wait, the current observation after turning left shows walls at 4 forward and 2 right. If the agent turns right now, that would face them in a direction where the wall to the right is only 2 steps, but the wall forward is 4 steps. That might not help. 

Alternatively, perhaps the agent needs to move forward cautiously. But moving forward would hit the wall in 4 steps. So that's not an option. 

The key is 3 steps left and 3 forward. So, if the agent turns left again, that would face them west (left from north), then moving forward 3 steps would get them to the key's position horizontally. Then they can turn north and move forward 3 steps. But there's a wall 4 steps forward, which is in the same direction as north. So maybe after moving west, they can't go north. 

Wait, maybe the agent needs to reorient themselves. Let's try to map this out. 

Suppose the agent is facing east. Then left would be north, right would be south. The wall 4 steps forward (east) and wall 2 steps right (south). The key is 3 steps left (north) and 3 forward (east). But the wall is directly in front, so moving east isn't possible. Turning left to face north, then moving forward 3 steps would reach the key's horizontal position, but then they need to go north 3 steps. But from that position, how? 

Alternatively, if the agent turns right to face south, the wall is 2 steps right (west), but moving forward 4 steps (south) is blocked. That doesn't help. 

Hmm, perhaps the agent needs to move in a different direction. Let's think differently. The key is 3 left and 3 forward. If the agent turns around, maybe they can approach from another angle. 

Wait, maybe the agent is currently facing north. The wall forward is 4 steps (north), wall to the right is 2 steps (east). The key is 3 steps left (west) and 3 forward (north). So from the current position, moving west 3 steps would get to the key's horizontal position, but then moving north 3 steps would hit the wall. So that's not possible. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to go around the wall. Since the wall is 4 steps forward, perhaps moving sideways. If the agent turns left (west), then moves forward 3 steps (west) to reach the key's horizontal position, then from there, they need to go north 3 steps. But the wall is 4 steps forward in the original direction (north), so when the agent is facing west, moving north would be a different direction. Wait, no. If the agent is facing west, moving north would be diagonal, but the key is 3 steps north from the new position. 

Wait, the original position has the key at 3 left (west) and 3 forward (north). So from the agent's current position, moving west 3 steps gets them to the same x-coordinate as the key. Then, moving north 3 steps would get them to the key's y-coordinate. But the wall is 4 steps north in the original direction, which would be 4 steps north from the agent's current position. However, if the agent is now facing west, moving north would be a different direction. 

This is getting complicated. Maybe the agent needs to adjust their direction again. Let's look at the latest observation again: walls at 4 forward and 2 right, key at 3 left and 3 forward. 

If the agent turns left again, they would face a direction where moving left (which was west before) is possible. Then moving forward 3 steps would reach the key's horizontal position. But then how to get north? 

Alternatively, perhaps the agent needs to move forward 2 steps (since the wall is 4 steps forward, but maybe there's a path after that?), but the observation says a wall 4 steps forward, so that's not possible. 

Wait, maybe the agent needs to toggle something, but there's no object mentioned in front. The key is not in front, it's diagonally. 

So the only possible actions are turn left, turn right, go forward (which is blocked), pick up (no key here), drop (not holding anything), toggle (nothing to toggle). 

But the agent can't go forward because the wall is 4 steps away. So the valid actions are turn left, turn right, pick up (no), drop (no), toggle (no). 

So the agent must turn either left or right. Which direction leads towards the key? 

If the agent turns left, their new forward direction would be west (assuming they were facing north). The key is 3 steps left (west) and 3 forward (north). So turning left and moving forward would get them closer west, but then they still need to go north. But moving north from that position might hit the wall? 

Alternatively, if the agent turns right, their new forward direction is south. The wall to the right is 2 steps (east), so turning right and moving forward might not help. 

Hmm. Maybe the agent needs to turn left to face west, then move forward 3 steps (but the key is west, then north). But after turning left, the forward direction is west. The key is 3 steps west and 3 steps north from the original position. So moving west 3 steps would get to the key's x-coordinate, then they need to move north 3 steps. But from the new position (west 3), moving north 3 steps would require facing north again. But the wall is 4 steps north from the original position. If the agent is now 3 steps west, moving north 3 steps would be 3 steps north from that position, which might not hit the wall. 

Wait, but the original wall is 4 steps forward (north) from the starting position. If the agent is now 3 steps west, moving north 3 steps would place them 3 steps north and 3 steps west from the start. The wall is 4 steps north from the start, so they are 1 step south of the wall. Therefore, moving north from that position would be safe. 

So the plan would be: turn left (face west), go forward 3 steps (reach key's x), then turn north (left again?), and go forward 3 steps. 

But how to turn north from facing west? If the agent is facing west, turning left would face north. So after moving west 3 steps, turn left (north) and go forward 3 steps. 

But in the current observation, after turning left, the agent would have the walls adjusted. But in the current observation, the walls are 4 forward and 2 right. If the agent turns left, their new forward direction is west, and the right direction is south. The wall is 4 steps forward (west), which is not correct. Wait, the observation says a wall 4 steps forward and 2 steps right. If turning left makes forward west, then the wall is 4 steps west, which matches the key being 3 steps west. 

So turning left would face the agent west, and moving forward 3 steps would reach the key's horizontal position. Then, turning left again (north) and moving forward 3 steps would get to the key. 

But the problem is that in the current observation, after turning left, the wall is 4 steps forward (west), but the key is only 3 steps west. So moving forward 3 steps would reach the key's x-coordinate, then turn left (north) and move forward 3 steps. 

But the key is at 3 steps left and 3 forward from the original position. So after moving west 3 steps, the agent is at the key's x. Then moving north 3 steps would reach the key. 

Therefore, the agent should turn left to face west, then go forward 3 steps. However, the action 'go forward' is only one step at a time. So the agent needs to perform 'go forward' three times. But the problem states not to repeat the same action if the observation doesn't change. 

But in this case, after each 'go forward', the observation would change as the agent moves. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent can turn left and then go forward once, then reorient. 

But given the current observation, the best action is to turn left to face the direction towards the key's horizontal position, then proceed forward. 

Therefore, the chosen action is 'turn left' to face west, aligning with the key's location.

Let me try to figure out what to do here. The current observation says there's a wall 5 steps forward, a wall 3 steps to the left, and the blue key is 3 steps right and 3 steps forward.

First, I need to understand where I'm facing. The previous actions were turning right and left multiple times, so maybe I'm moving around the walls. The key is positioned 3 steps right and forward. Let me visualize my position. If there's a wall 5 steps forward, that means the path ahead is blocked, so I can't go straight. The key is to the right and ahead, so I probably need to face a direction where that key is reachable.

Looking at the latest observation: walls are forward and left, so maybe I'm facing north. The key is 3 steps right (east) and 3 forward (north). If I'm facing north, moving forward would hit the wall. To get to the key, I need to turn east (right) and then go forward. But wait, in previous steps, turning right might have already been done. Let me check the history.

Earlier, the assistant turned right, left, right, left, etc., navigating around walls. Now, the key is 3 right and 3 forward. If I'm facing north, turning right would make me face east. Then moving forward 3 steps would get me to the key. But wait, the observation mentions the key is 3 steps right and 3 steps forward. So from my current position, if I turn right (east), then go forward 3 steps, that would place me at the key's location. Then I can pick it up. So the actions needed would be turn right, then go forward three times, then pick up. But the current observation doesn't mention the key's position changing, so maybe I just need to align my direction correctly.

Looking at the current observation again: the key is 3 steps right and 3 steps forward. If I'm facing a direction where right is east and forward is north, then turning right (east) and then moving forward 3 steps would get me to the key. But before moving forward, I need to ensure there's no wall in that path. The current observation says a wall is 5 steps forward, but that might be in the current facing direction. If I turn right, the forward path might be clear. Wait, the observation after turning right previously had different wall distances. So maybe after turning right, the forward path is clear for 4 steps, as seen in some previous observations. 

In the latest observation, after turning right, if I'm now facing east, the wall is 3 steps left (which would be south) and 4 steps forward (north). So moving forward from there would be possible. Wait, but the current observation's walls are 5 steps forward (if still facing north) and 3 steps left (west). The key is east and north. So perhaps I need to turn right to face east, then go forward, then turn north? Wait, no. If I'm facing east, moving forward would be east, but the key is north and east. So maybe after turning right (east), I need to go forward some steps, then turn north? But the key's position is 3 right and 3 forward from current position. If current direction is north, turning right to face east, then moving forward 3 steps would take me 3 east, but the key is 3 east and 3 north. So after moving east 3 steps, I would still need to go north 3 steps, but there's a wall 5 steps north. That's a problem. Wait, maybe my initial direction assumption is wrong.

Alternatively, if I'm facing east, then moving forward would be east, and the key is 3 east and 3 north. That would require turning north, but how? Maybe I'm facing a different direction. Let's try to map this out step by step.

Let's assume the agent starts facing north. The first observation had a wall 2 steps forward (north) and 3 steps left (west). The agent turned right (now facing east), then the next observation had walls 4 steps forward (east) and 2 steps left (south). Then turned right again (now facing south), etc. This is getting a bit complicated. Maybe the agent is moving in a square, going around the walls.

In the current observation, the walls are 5 steps forward and 3 steps left. Let's say the agent is facing north again. The key is 3 steps right (east) and 3 steps forward (north). So from current position, if I turn right to face east, then go forward, but there's a wall 3 steps left (which would be south) but that's after turning. Wait, when facing east, the walls would be in different directions. The current observation's walls are 5 steps forward (north) and 3 steps left (west). Wait, no, if the agent is facing north, forward is north, left is west. The key is east and north. So the agent needs to turn east (right), then go forward, then turn north? But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the agent needs to adjust its direction to face a direction where moving forward and right reaches the key. If the key is 3 east and 3 north, the agent could face northeast, but the allowed actions are only turn left/right and go forward. So maybe the agent needs to turn right (east), move forward 3 steps, then turn north (which would require another turn?), but turning is only left or right. 

Wait, the actions are turn left, turn right, go forward, pick up, drop, toggle. So after turning right to face east, moving forward 3 steps would get to the east position, but then the key is 3 steps north from there. But moving north from east would require turning north, which isn't a direct action. The agent can only turn left or right from its current facing direction. 

If facing east, turning left would face north, and turning right would face south. So to face north from east, the agent would need to turn left once. Then moving forward would take them north. So the sequence would be: turn right (east), go forward 3 (to east position), turn left (north), go forward 3 (to key's position). Then pick up.

But in the current observation, after turning right, the agent might have a different wall configuration. Let me check the current observation again: walls 5 steps forward (north), 3 steps left (west). The key is 3 east and 3 north. So if the agent is facing north, turning right to east, then moving forward would face east, but how far can they go? The previous observation when facing east had walls 4 steps forward. So maybe moving forward 4 steps from there. But the key is 3 steps forward from the current position. Wait, the key's position is 3 steps right and 3 forward from the agent's current position. So if the agent is at (0,0), facing north, the key is at (3,3). The walls are at (0,5) forward (north), and (-3,0) left (west). 

To reach (3,3), the agent needs to move east and then north. But movement is only one step at a time. So first, turn right (east), move forward until x=3, then turn left (north), move forward until y=3. But each move is one step. So the agent needs to turn right, then go forward three times (since the key is 3 steps east), then turn left, go forward three times. But each 'go forward' is one step. So the actions would be: turn right, go forward, go forward, go forward, turn left, go forward, go forward, go forward, pick up. But that's a lot of steps. However, the agent needs to choose the next action based on the current observation.

In the current observation, the key is 3 steps right and 3 steps forward. The walls are 5 forward (north) and 3 left (west). The agent is facing north. So to get to the key, which is east and north, the agent needs to turn right to face east, then move forward three steps. But before moving, does the path east have obstacles? The current observation after turning right might have different walls. Wait, in the previous steps, after turning right, the observation showed a wall 4 steps forward (east) and 2 steps left (south). So from there, moving forward four steps would reach the wall. But the key is three steps east and three steps north. So after turning right (east), the agent can move forward three steps (reaching x=3), then turn left (north) and move three steps. But in the current observation, the walls are 5 steps forward (north) when facing north, but when facing east, the walls might be different. 

But the current observation doesn't specify the walls when facing other directions. The observation given is from the agent's current perspective. So when the agent is facing north, the walls are 5 steps forward (north) and 3 steps left (west). The key is 3 east and 3 north. So to reach the key, the agent needs to adjust direction to east, then proceed. 

The next logical step is to turn right to face east, allowing the agent to move towards the key's eastern position. Once facing east, the agent can then move forward three steps. But before moving, it's important to check if there's a wall in that path. However, the current observation doesn't provide info about walls in other directions. But based on previous steps, when facing east, there was a wall 4 steps forward. If that's the case, moving forward three steps would be safe. 

So the chosen action should be to turn right, aligning the agent to face east, which is the direction towards the key's east component. Then the next steps would be to go forward three times. But since the agent needs to choose one action at a time, the first action should be to turn right to face the correct direction.

Let's try to figure out the next move here. The current observation says there's a wall 4 steps forward, a wall 2 steps to the right, and the blue key is 3 steps left and 3 steps forward.

Looking back at the previous steps, the agent has been turning left and right to navigate around the walls. The key's position is consistently 3 steps left and 3 forward. So maybe the agent needs to align its direction to face towards the key.

In the last few observations, the agent turned left when facing a wall forward and a wall on the left, which might have changed the direction. Now, with the wall 2 steps right and the key 3 left and forward, perhaps the agent should turn left again to face a direction where it can move towards the key. Alternatively, after turning left, moving forward might get closer to the key.

Wait, but if the agent is facing a direction where moving forward would hit a wall, turning left again could help reorient. Let me visualize the possible directions. Suppose the agent is facing north. A wall 4 steps forward (north) and a wall 2 steps right (east). The key is 3 steps left (west) and 3 steps forward (north). That doesn't add up because if north is blocked, maybe the agent needs to face a different direction. Hmm, maybe the agent is facing south? Then a wall 4 steps south (forward) and a wall 2 steps right (east). The key is 3 steps left (west) and 3 steps forward (south). That would place the key behind the agent, which doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm getting the directions confused.

Alternatively, the agent could be facing east. Wall 4 steps forward (east), wall 2 steps right (north). The key is 3 steps left (west) and 3 steps forward (east). So the key is directly in front but 3 steps, but there's a wall 4 steps forward. That doesn't align. Wait, maybe the agent is facing west. Wall 4 steps forward (west), wall 2 steps right (south). The key is 3 steps left (east) and 3 steps forward (west). So the key is west but 3 steps away, but there's a wall 4 steps west. That also doesn't fit.

This is confusing. Maybe the agent needs to adjust its direction to face a path that leads towards the key. Since the key is 3 left and 3 forward from the current position, perhaps the agent needs to turn left twice to face a direction where moving forward three steps would reach the key, and then adjust left. Wait, but the previous actions were turning left and right to navigate around walls. The last observation had the key at 3 left and 3 forward, so maybe the agent needs to turn left to face a direction where moving forward would get closer. Let's think step by step.

If the agent turns left from its current facing direction, maybe it can then move forward towards the key. But given the walls, perhaps the agent needs to first turn left to avoid the wall on the right and then move forward. Alternatively, after turning left, the agent could move forward towards the key. Let's assume the agent is facing north. Wall forward (north 4), wall right (east 2). Key is west 3 and north 3. But north is blocked, so the key is west and north, which would be northwest direction. So to reach the key, the agent needs to go west first. But turning left from north would face west. Wait, if facing north, turning left would face west. Then moving forward would go west, which is towards the key's left (west) direction. But the key is west 3 and north 3. So moving west 3 steps would get to the key's position, but then the agent would need to go north. But there's a wall 4 steps north. Maybe that's not the way.

Alternatively, if the agent turns right from north, facing east. There's a wall 2 steps east, so turning right (east) and moving forward would hit the wall. So that's not helpful. So maybe the agent needs to turn left to face west, then move forward towards the west direction. But the key is west 3 and north 3. So moving west 3 steps would get to the key's west position, but then the agent would need to go north, but there's a wall 4 steps north. So perhaps the agent can't proceed that way.

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to adjust its direction to face a direction where both left and forward movements can lead towards the key. For example, if the agent turns left (west) and moves forward, then turns north to go towards the key. But how to do that in one action?

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to use the toggle action, but there's no object in front. The key is not in front, it's to the left and forward. So the agent needs to reposition itself to face the key. Given the walls, the agent should turn left to face west, then move forward steps until it's in a position to head north towards the key. But the wall is 4 steps forward when facing north. Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe the best action is to turn left again to align with a direction that allows moving towards the key without hitting walls. Alternatively, the agent has been toggling back and forth, but the key isn't reachable yet. So the next logical step is to turn left to adjust direction and then move forward when possible.

Let's try to figure out what needs to be done here. The goal is to get the blue key. From the current observation, there's a wall 5 steps forward, a wall 3 steps left, and the blue key is located 3 steps right and 3 steps forward.

So, the agent's current direction isn't clear, but based on previous observations and actions, maybe I can deduce the direction. The assistant has been turning right and left alternately, trying to navigate around walls. Now, the key is 3 steps right and 3 steps forward. The agent needs to face a direction where moving forward will get them closer to the key's position.

If the agent is facing north, for example, moving forward would decrease the forward steps, but the key is 3 steps forward and 3 to the right. Maybe they need to turn right to face east, then move forward three times and right three times. But there's a wall 3 steps forward right now. Wait, the current observation says a wall 5 steps forward, so maybe the agent is facing a wall that's 5 steps ahead. So, turning right would face them south, perhaps? Let me think.

Alternatively, the agent might need to adjust their direction to face the key. Let's say the key is to the northeast. If the agent turns right (south?), then moves forward, but there's a wall 4 steps forward in the previous observation. Hmm. Maybe the agent needs to go around the wall by turning left or right to a direction where there's no wall blocking the path towards the key.

Wait, the key is 3 steps right and 3 steps forward. So, from the agent's current position, if they turn right (let's say that's east), then move forward, but there's a wall 5 steps forward. That's not helpful. If they turn left (west?), then move forward, but the wall is 3 steps left. Maybe the agent needs to face north, then move forward? But there's a wall 5 steps forward. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, maybe the agent has to navigate around the walls to reach the key. For example, if the agent turns right (east), then moves forward until they can't, then turns right again (south), then moves forward to the key's position. But the key's position is 3 steps right and 3 forward. Maybe the agent needs to go around the walls in a spiral or find a path that leads towards the key's coordinates.

Alternatively, maybe the agent should check their current orientation. If the key is 3 right and 3 forward, perhaps the agent needs to face a direction where moving right and forward would lead them there. Let's think about possible orientations.

Suppose the agent is facing north. The wall is 5 steps forward (north), 3 steps left (west). The key is 3 right (east) and 3 forward (north). But if facing north, moving east would be right, so moving right once would face east, then moving forward 3 steps. But from the current observation, moving forward is blocked by a wall 5 steps away. Wait, but the key is 3 steps east and 3 north. If the agent is facing north, they can't move north because of the wall, so they need to turn right to face east. But then moving forward east might not be blocked. Wait, the current observation says a wall 5 steps forward. If facing east, then moving forward (east) would hit a wall 5 steps away. That's not good. So maybe the agent needs to adjust their direction differently.

Alternatively, if the agent turns left (west), then moves forward, but there's a wall 3 steps left. Wait, perhaps the agent is facing south? Let's try that. If facing south, the wall is 5 steps forward (south), 3 steps left (east). The key is 3 steps right (west) and 3 steps forward (south). So, to get to the key, the agent would need to move west 3 steps and south 3 steps. But facing south, moving forward would be into the wall. So they need to turn left to face west. Then move forward 3 steps west, then turn around (180 degrees) to face east, but the key is west. Wait, this is confusing.

Maybe the agent needs to use the toggle or pick up actions, but the key isn't in front of them. The key is 3 steps right and 3 forward, so the agent needs to navigate to that position. But the walls are blocking direct paths. The previous actions involved turning right and left to navigate around walls. The latest observation shows a wall 5 steps forward, 3 left, and the key at 3 right and 3 forward. The agent needs to find a path where they can move towards the key without hitting walls.

Perhaps the agent should turn right to face a direction where moving forward isn't blocked. For example, if they turn right, then move forward until the wall is out of the way, then adjust direction again. But the current observation after turning right might have different walls. Alternatively, the agent needs to go around the wall by moving in a perpendicular direction.

Wait, the key is 3 steps right and 3 forward. If the agent can face a direction where moving right and forward gets them there, maybe facing northeast. To face northeast, the agent would need to turn right then right again (south then east?), but that might not be the case. Navigation directions can be tricky without knowing the starting orientation.

Alternatively, maybe the agent should try to move towards the key by adjusting their direction step by step. For example, turn right to face east, then move forward until the wall is 5 steps away (but that's not helpful). Or turn left to face west, move forward 3 steps (but the wall is 3 steps left, which would be west?). Hmm.

The key is in the NE direction relative to the agent's current position. If the agent can face NE, then move towards it. But given the walls, they might need to go around. For example, turn right (east), move forward as much as possible, then turn right (south), move forward past the wall, then turn left (east again), and head towards the key. But this is speculative.

Another approach: since the agent needs to get the blue key, which is not directly in front but at a specific location, the priority is to navigate towards that location while avoiding walls. The latest observation shows the key is 3 right and 3 forward. So the agent needs to adjust their heading to face a direction where moving right and forward will lead them to the key's position. 

If the agent is currently facing north, turning right (east) and moving forward might not work due to walls. Turning left (west) would face them west, but the wall is 3 steps left (west). Moving forward west would hit the wall. So maybe the agent needs to turn around (180 degrees) to face south, but the wall is 5 steps forward (south). Hmm.

Alternatively, the agent could turn right (east), then move forward until the wall is behind them, then turn left (north) to move towards the key. But current observations show that moving forward when facing east would hit a wall 5 steps away. So that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps the agent should first turn left to face west, then move forward. But the wall is 3 steps left, which would be west. So moving forward west would hit the wall. That's not helpful. 

Alternatively, the agent can turn right, then right again to face south, then move forward past the wall, then turn left to face east, and then move towards the key. But I'm not sure if that path is clear.

This is getting complicated. The previous actions from the assistant were turning right and left alternately, which might be a way to spiral around the walls. Maybe the agent needs to continue turning right to change direction and find a path towards the key. For example, in the current observation, turning right would face the agent south, and moving forward might be possible if there's no wall. Wait, the current observation says a wall 5 steps forward, but if the agent turns right, their new forward direction would be south, and the observation mentions a wall 4 steps forward in a previous step. Maybe the walls are in different positions based on the agent's direction.

Alternatively, think of the agent's direction as a variable. Let's assume the agent starts facing north. The first observation: wall 2 steps forward (north), wall 3 steps left (west). So the agent is at a crossroads with a wall to the north and west. The agent turns right (east), next observation: wall 4 steps forward (east?), wall 2 steps left (south?). Then turns right again (south), next observation: wall 5 steps forward (south), wall 3 steps right (east). Then the key is found 2 steps right and 3 forward. So the agent is moving in a spiral, trying to navigate around the perimeter of the walls.

But now, in the latest observation, the wall is 5 steps forward, 3 steps left, and the key is 3 right and 3 forward. If the agent is facing south (since previous turns were right, right, right...), then forward would be south, left would be east. The key is 3 steps right (west) and 3 forward (south). So to get to the key, the agent needs to move west 3 steps and south 3 steps. But facing south, moving forward is into the wall. So the agent needs to turn left to face west, then move forward 3 steps, then turn around (180) to face east, but then how to get the key which is west?

Wait, maybe the key's position is relative to the agent's current position. If the agent turns right (east), then the key is 3 steps west and 3 forward. That doesn't make sense. This is confusing without knowing the exact layout.

Perhaps the best action here is to continue turning right to change direction and eventually find a path towards the key. Alternatively, try to move forward if possible. But the current observation says a wall 5 steps forward, so moving forward isn't possible. Therefore, the agent must turn to a direction where moving forward is possible towards the key.

Given that the key is 3 steps right and 3 forward, the agent needs to face a direction where moving right and forward will reach the key. If the agent turns left (west), then moves forward, but there's a wall 3 steps left (west). So moving forward west would hit the wall. If the agent turns right (east), moving forward would hit a wall 5 steps away. 

Wait, maybe the agent needs to toggle or interact with something, but the key isn't in front. The key is at a distance, so the agent needs to navigate there. The only possible actions are turning or moving, but moving forward is blocked. So the agent has to turn in a direction that allows moving towards the key without hitting walls.

Given the key's position, perhaps the agent should turn left to face west, then move forward until the wall is passed, but the wall is 3 steps left (west). So moving forward west would hit the wall. Therefore, the agent must turn right to face east, but moving forward there is a wall. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the agent should turn around (180 degrees) to face north, but the wall is 5 steps forward (north). So that's not possible. 

This is tricky. The agent might be stuck in a loop turning right and left but not making progress towards the key. Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to move in a different pattern. Since the previous actions mostly alternated between turning right and left, perhaps the agent should try turning left this time to see if that opens up a new path.

In the current observation, the agent could turn left, which would face them west (if previously facing north), but there's a wall 3 steps left (west). Moving forward west would hit the wall. So turning left isn't helpful. 

Alternatively, the agent could turn right twice (180 degrees) to face the opposite direction. If originally facing north, turning right twice would face south. Then moving forward 5 steps would hit the wall. Not helpful. 

Wait, maybe the key is in a position that requires the agent to go around the walls in a specific way. For example, go north around the left wall, then east. But the left wall is 3 steps left (west), so if the agent turns left (west) and moves forward, they hit the wall. 

I think the best bet here is to continue turning right to change direction and look for a path that allows moving towards the key. The previous actions suggest that turning right alternately helps navigate around the walls. So the agent should turn right again to face a new direction and attempt to move forward once the wall is out of the way.

16,turn left,"<reasoning>
I need to get to the blue key. Let's look at the current observation. The key is 3 steps left and 3 steps forward. A wall is 4 steps forward and 2 steps right. So where am I facing right now?

Earlier actions had me turning left and right, probably trying to face the direction of the key. Let me visualize the direction. If the key is left and forward, maybe I need to face north or west? Let's check the previous steps.

The last observations showed the key at different positions relative to walls. Wait, the key is 3 left and 3 forward. If there's a wall 4 forward, that means I can't go straight ahead for four steps. So to get to the key, I might have to go forward a few steps, then turn left or right to reach the key's location.

But how do I get there without hitting the walls? Let's think about directions. Suppose I'm currently facing east. The key is 3 left (which would be north) and 3 forward. But there's a wall 2 steps right (so west) and 4 forward (south). So if I'm facing east, moving forward would hit the wall in 4 steps. So maybe I need to turn left to face north. Then move forward 3 steps, but wait, the wall is 4 forward when facing east, but if I turn north, can I move forward?

Alternatively, maybe I need to adjust my direction to face towards the key. Let's check the key's position again: 3 left and 3 forward. If left is west (assuming standard directions), and forward is north, then from my current position, moving west 3 and north 3. But the walls are in the way. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the key is in a different quadrant. Let me try to map this out. If there's a wall 4 forward, that's straight ahead. So if I'm facing north, the wall is north. Then a wall 2 steps left would be west. The key is 3 left (west) and 3 forward (north). But the wall is already 4 steps north, so moving north 3 steps would hit the wall. That can't be right. So maybe the key's position is relative to my current direction.

Wait, the key is 3 steps left and 3 steps forward from my current position. So if I'm facing north, left would be west. So the key is west 3 and north 3. But the wall is 4 steps north, so moving north 3 steps would reach the key's north position, but then west 3. But if the wall is 4 steps north, then moving north 3 is possible before hitting the wall. Then from there, go west 3 steps. But how do I know if the path is clear?

Alternatively, if I'm facing east, left is north. The key is 3 north and 3 east. But the wall is 4 east. So moving east would hit the wall. Hmm. Wait, the observation says a wall 4 steps forward and 2 steps left. If forward is east, then left is north. So the key is 3 left (north) and 3 forward (east). But the wall is 4 east, so moving east 3 steps would be possible, but then north. But if the key is 3 east and 3 north from current position, then I need to go east 3, then north 3. But the wall is east 4, so east 3 is okay. But then after moving east 3, can I go north 3? If there's no wall, but the observation doesn't mention a wall north. Wait, the current observation only mentions walls in front (4 steps) and left (2 steps). So other directions might be clear.

So the plan could be: turn left to face north, then go forward 3 steps to reach the key's north position. Then from there, turn right (east) to face east and go forward 3 steps to the key. Wait, but the key is 3 left and 3 forward from the original position. If I'm facing north, moving left (west) 3 steps and forward (north) 3 steps would take me to the key. But how?

Alternatively, maybe I need to adjust my direction step by step. Let's look at the previous actions. The user kept turning left and right, trying to face the direction of the key. Now, in the current observation, the key is 3 left and 3 forward. The walls are 4 forward and 2 right. So if I'm facing west, left would be south. But the key is left (south) and forward (west). But the wall is 4 forward (west), so moving forward would hit the wall. That's not good.

Alternatively, if I'm facing south, left is east. The key is 3 left (east) and 3 forward (south). But the wall is 4 forward (south), so moving south 3 steps would be possible. Then from there, move east 3 steps to get the key. But how do I face south?

Wait, the previous actions were a series of left and right turns, possibly to adjust direction. Let's see the last few observations and actions. For example:

Previous observation had the key at 3 steps right and 3 forward. The agent turned right. Then observation changed. It's a bit hard to trace the exact direction changes, but perhaps the agent is oscillating between directions due to the walls.

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to move forward carefully. For instance, even though there's a wall 4 steps forward, maybe moving forward a few steps at a time and then turning. But the key is 3 forward and 3 left. If the agent can move forward 3 steps, then turn left and move 3 steps, that would reach the key. But the wall is 4 steps forward, so moving 3 steps forward is possible. However, the observation after moving forward would be needed to confirm if there's a wall in the way.

Wait, the current observation says a wall 4 steps forward. So moving forward once would leave 3 steps to the wall. So moving forward once is possible. Then, after moving forward, the agent's new position's forward direction would have a wall 3 steps away. Then, turning left (which direction would that be?) to face north or west, depending on original direction.

But without knowing the agent's current facing direction, it's challenging. The agent's previous actions might indicate the direction. For example, if the agent turned right multiple times, maybe they are now facing a different direction.

Alternatively, perhaps the agent should try to go around the wall. Since the wall is 4 steps forward, moving forward once, then turning left to face a direction where the path is clear. For example, if after moving forward once, the left direction is clear (no wall mentioned), then move left (which would be north if originally facing east) and then proceed.

But given the current observation, after moving forward once, the walls would be 3 steps forward and 2 steps left (assuming original direction was east). Then, turning left to face north, and moving forward towards the key. But the key is 3 left and 3 forward from the original position, which would now be 2 left (west) and 2 forward from the new position.

This is getting complicated. Maybe the best approach is to check the direction of the key relative to current position and walls, and choose the next move that gets closer to the key without hitting a wall.

The key is 3 left and 3 forward. If I can turn left (to face a direction where left is towards the key's west or north, depending on current facing) and then move forward, that might help.

Alternatively, since the key is 3 left and 3 forward, and there's a wall 4 forward, maybe moving forward 3 steps first (since wall is 4 steps away), then turning left and moving forward 3 steps. But need to ensure that after moving forward 3, turning left doesn't hit a wall.

But how to determine the direction? Let's think of possible facing directions:

Case 1: Facing north.

- Wall 4 forward (north), so moving north is blocked after 4 steps.

- Wall 2 left (west). So left is west, 2 steps.

- Key is 3 left (west) and 3 forward (north). So from current position, moving west 3 and north 3. But moving north 3 would hit the wall at step 4. So that's not possible.

Case 2: Facing east.

- Wall 4 forward (east), which is the direction of the key's forward. The key is 3 left (north) and 3 forward (east). So moving east 3 steps (since wall is at 4), then north 3 steps. But after moving east 3, the forward direction would be north. Is there a wall north? The current observation doesn't mention a wall north, only forward (east) and left (north). So moving east 3, then north 3 should reach the key. But how to confirm the path is clear.

In this case, the agent should turn left (to face north) and move forward 3 steps. But how to turn left from facing east? Turning left from east would face north. Then move forward 3 steps. Then, from there, turn right (east) and move forward 3 steps to get the key.

But the current observation shows the key is 3 left and 3 forward from the agent's current position. If the agent is facing east, left is north, so the key is north 3 and east 3. But the agent's current position's forward (east) has a wall at 4 steps, so moving east 3 is possible. Then, from that new position, moving north 3 steps would reach the key. So the steps would be: turn left (north), move forward 3, turn right (east), move forward 3. But how to do that in one move? The agent can only do one action at a time.

So the next action should be to turn left to face north, then move forward 3. But since the agent can only take one action per turn, first turn left, then move forward.

But in the current observation, after turning left, the forward direction would be north, and the key is north 3 and west 3 from the agent's new position. Wait, no. If the agent is facing north after turning left from east, then the key is 3 steps left (west) and 3 steps forward (north). So moving forward 3 would reach the key's north position, then moving west 3. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the agent should first move forward 3 steps towards the key's forward direction (east), then turn left to face north and move west 3. But moving forward 3 from facing east would take the agent to the position where forward is east 3, and then left is north. Then moving north 3 steps would reach the key. But the key is west 3 from that new position. Wait, that doesn't add up. Maybe I'm getting confused.

Let me try to map it out step by step.

Current Position (assuming facing east):

- Key is 3 left (north) and 3 forward (east).

- Wall is 4 steps forward (east) and 2 steps left (north).

If the agent turns left (now facing north), then:

- Moving forward 3 steps would take them to the position where east is 3 steps from the original position. From there, the key is west 3 and north 0 (since they're already north 3). Wait, no. The key is original position's east 3 and north 3. So after moving north 3 steps from original position, the agent is at (original.x, original.y +3). The key is at (original.x -3, original.y +3). So from the agent's new position, they need to move west 3 steps. But can they do that? If there are no walls west of them, then yes.

But the original observation doesn't mention any walls west, only forward (east) and left (north). So moving west 3 steps should be possible. So the actions would be: turn left (north), go forward 3, then go west 3. But since the agent can only take one action at a time, the next action should be to turn left to face north, then move forward.

But in the current observation, after turning left, the agent's forward direction is north, and the key is 3 left (west) and 3 forward (north). So moving forward 3 steps would get them to the key's north position, then they need to move west 3. But how to do that in one move? They can't move diagonally. So the agent needs to first move forward 3, then turn left (west) and move west 3.

But in the current observation, the agent hasn't moved yet. So the best next action is to turn left to face north, which would align them to move towards the key's forward direction.

Alternatively, if the agent is facing a different direction, this might not work. But based on previous actions, perhaps the agent is facing east. For example, in earlier steps, the agent turned right multiple times, which from east would make them face south, then right again to west, etc. It's hard to track without a full history.

Alternatively, the agent could try to move forward once to reduce the distance to the wall, then turn left and proceed.

In the current observation, moving forward would get the agent to a position where forward is 3 steps to the wall, left is 2 steps. Then, turning left (to face north) and moving forward 3 steps towards the key. But the key is west 3 from there. So after moving forward 3, the agent would face north, then need to turn left (west) and move west 3.

But again, only one action can be taken at a time. So the next action should be to turn left to face north, then move forward 3. But how to confirm that moving forward 3 is possible. The current observation says a wall 4 steps forward, but after moving forward once, the wall is 3 steps away. So moving forward once is allowed.

Wait, but in the current observation, the wall is 4 steps forward. So moving forward once would leave 3 steps to the wall. Then, from there, moving forward again would be 2 steps to the wall, etc. But the key is 3 forward and 3 left from the original position. So if the agent moves forward 3 steps from original position (facing east), they would be at the position where east is 3 steps from original, and then need to move north 3 steps west 3. But this is getting too convoluted.

Maybe the simplest solution is to turn left to face the direction where the key's left and forward directions are accessible. Given that the key is 3 left and 3 forward, and the wall is 4 forward, turning left (assuming original direction is east) to face north, then moving forward 3 steps towards the key's north position, and then west 3. But again, one action at a time.

So the next action should be to turn left to face north, then move forward. But the agent can only choose one action per step. So the immediate action is to turn left. Then, in the next step, move forward.

But in the current observation, the agent is at a position where the key is 3 left and 3 forward, walls are 4 forward and 2 right. The agent needs to choose between turning, moving, etc.

Another approach: The key is in a direction that's a combination of left and forward. If the agent can align themselves so that their forward direction is towards the key's location, then they can move towards it. But given the walls, they might need to navigate around.

Alternatively, since the key is 3 left and 3 forward, and the agent can't go straight forward due to the wall, they might need to turn left and go forward, then turn right and go forward. For example, turn left (north), move forward 3, then turn right (east), move forward 3. But again, need to check if paths are clear.

But how to determine the agent's current facing direction. Since the agent's previous actions were turning left and right, perhaps they're facing a different direction now. For example, if they've been turning right multiple times, they might be facing west.

Alternatively, maybe the agent should try to move forward once to reduce the wall distance, then turn left and proceed.

So, considering all this, the next best action is to turn left to face a direction where the key is reachable. Given the current observation, turning left seems like a good move to align with the key's position.

a blue key 3 steps right and 3 steps forward",0,False
17,turn right,"<reasoning>
Let's see. The goal is to get to the blue key. The current observation says there's a wall 5 steps forward, a wall 3 steps left, and the blue key is 3 steps right and 3 steps forward.

Hmm, so the agent is facing some direction, and needs to navigate to the key. But the wall in front is blocking the direct path. Let's think about the agent's possible movements. The key is 3 steps right and 3 steps forward. So maybe the agent needs to turn right to face a direction where they can go forward and then adjust to the right again.

Wait, the agent already turned right in some previous steps. Let's see the previous actions. The user's history shows that the agent kept turning left and right, but ended up in a loop. Maybe the agent needs to find a path that avoids the walls.

The current position has a wall 3 steps left, so turning left is not helpful here. Turning right would face the agent to a direction where maybe there's a path. If the agent turns right, then they can go forward towards the key's location. But the key is 3 steps right and 3 steps forward. So after turning right, moving forward 3 steps would get them closer. Then they might need to turn right again to adjust their direction towards the key.

Alternatively, maybe the agent should first turn right to face a direction where they can move forward towards the key's position. Let's visualize: If the agent is facing north, the wall to the left (west) is 3 steps. The wall forward (north) is 5 steps. The key is 3 steps east (right) and 3 steps north (forward). So if the agent turns right (now facing east), moving forward 3 steps would reach the point where the key is 3 steps ahead. Then from there, maybe another turn right to face north? Or maybe the key is in that direction.

Wait, the key's position is 3 steps right and 3 steps forward from the current position. If the agent turns right, their forward direction becomes east. Then moving forward 3 steps would make them 3 steps east. Then, to get the key, which is 3 steps forward from the original position, that would be another 3 steps north. But if after turning right, moving east 3 steps gets them to a point where they can then turn north (maybe another right turn?), then they can proceed forward.

But there's a wall 5 steps forward in the original direction. So if the agent is facing north initially, forward is blocked. Turning right to east, moving forward 3 steps would reach the point where the key's east component is covered. Then, turning right again (now facing south?), but that might not help. Alternatively, after moving east 3 steps, maybe turn north again? But how?

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to go around the wall. Since the wall is 5 steps forward, the agent can't go straight. So turning right (east) and moving forward as much as possible until they hit a wall, then turning again. But the key is east and north, so perhaps the agent needs to go east, then north.

Wait, but in the current observation, the key is 3 steps right (east) and 3 steps forward (north) from the agent's current position. So if the agent turns right (east), moves forward 3 steps, then turns north (another right turn?), but how?

Alternatively, after turning right and moving forward 3 steps, the agent's new position is east 3, north 0. The key is at east 3, north 3. So from that position, the agent needs to move north 3 steps. But in the current observation, after turning right, the wall forward is 4 steps. Wait, no—the observation after turning right might have different walls. Wait, the latest observation is:

Current Observation:
a wall 5 steps forward
a wall 3 steps left
a blue key 3 steps right and 3 steps forward

So the agent is facing a direction where forward is blocked by a wall 5 steps away. Left is blocked by a wall 3 steps. The key is 3 right and 3 forward.

If the agent turns right, their new forward direction would be east (assuming initial facing was north). Then moving forward 3 steps would get them to east 3, north 0. But from there, to get to the key at east 3, north 3, they need to move north 3 steps. But after turning right, the observation after moving forward might show a different wall configuration.

Alternatively, maybe the agent should first turn right to face east, then move forward until they can't anymore, then turn north (another right turn) and move forward. But how do we know the walls in those directions?

Alternatively, the agent needs to navigate using the relative positions. Since the key is 3 right and 3 forward, the optimal path might be to turn right, move forward 3, then turn north (another right turn?), but perhaps the agent's direction after turning right is east, then turning right again would face south, which isn't helpful. Maybe turning left after moving east?

Wait, perhaps the agent should first turn right to face east. Then go forward as far as possible. Let's say after turning right, the agent can move forward 3 steps (since the key is 3 steps right and 3 forward). Then, from there, they need to move north 3 steps. But how to do that if the walls are in the way.

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to go around the wall. Since directly north is blocked, go east, then north. But how to confirm the walls in those directions.

Alternatively, the agent can try to move towards the key's coordinates step by step. Since the key is 3 right and 3 forward, the agent needs to adjust both x and y coordinates. But given the walls, the path might require turning and moving in a grid-like manner.

Another approach: The agent's current direction is such that forward is blocked (5 steps). Left is blocked (3 steps). The key is east and north. So the agent needs to turn right (east) to face a direction where they can move towards the key. Moving forward east 3 steps would align them with the key's east component. Then, from there, they need to move north. But north from the new position would require turning north, which might be a left turn from facing east.

So after turning right (east) and moving forward 3 steps, the agent's new position is east 3, north 0. The key is at east 3, north 3. So the agent needs to move north 3 steps. To do that, they need to turn north, which is a left turn from east. So turn left (now facing north), then move forward 3 steps. That would reach the key.

But how do we know that moving north from there isn't blocked? The current observation doesn't provide that info. But the previous observations might give clues. For example, in earlier steps, when the agent turned right and left, the walls were in certain positions. However, since the agent is in a loop of turning left and right without progress, maybe the correct action is to break the loop and move towards the key's direction.

Alternatively, maybe the agent should use the 'toggle' action, but there's nothing to toggle in front. The key is below, but the agent isn't directly facing it yet.

So, the best action here is to turn right to face the direction where the key is east, then move forward. But first, check the current observation. The current observation says after previous turns, the walls are 4 steps forward, 2 steps left, etc. But in the latest observation, the walls are 5 steps forward, 3 steps left, and the key is 3 right and 3 forward. So the agent should turn right to face east, then go forward 3 steps. But since the agent can only move one step at a time, they need to move forward three times. But the problem states not to repeat the same action if the observation doesn't change. However, in this case, each step forward would change the observation.

So the first action should be to turn right to face east, then go forward once. Let's check: if the agent turns right, their forward direction is east. Then moving forward would reduce the distance to the key's east component. After that, they might need to turn left to face north and move forward. But let's see the current observation again.

Current Observation:
a wall 5 steps forward
a wall 3 steps left
a blue key 3 steps right and 3 steps forward

The agent is facing a direction where forward is blocked (5 steps), left is blocked (3 steps). The key is to the right (east) and forward (north). So turning right would face the agent east. Moving forward would take them one step east, reducing the east distance to 2. Then, they would need to adjust their direction to north. Turning left from east would face north. Then moving forward towards the key.

But after turning right and moving forward once, the observation would change. Let's assume that after turning right, the wall forward is now, say, 4 steps (from previous observations). Then moving forward would get closer to the key.

Therefore, the best action now is to turn right to face east, then move forward. But the agent needs to choose between turning right or left. Since turning left would face west (which has a wall 3 steps left), that's not helpful. Turning right (east) is better.

So the chosen action should be to turn right.

18,go forward,"<reasoning>
Let's see where I need to go. The goal is the blue key. The current observation says the blue key is 3 steps left and 3 steps forward. So, first, I need to figure out my current direction.

Looking at the previous observations, the agent was turning left and right a lot, maybe trying to get oriented. The last observation mentions a wall 4 steps forward and a wall 2 steps right. So maybe the agent is facing a direction where forward has a wall, and to the right is also a wall. 

Wait, the key is 3 steps left and 3 forward. If the agent is facing a direction where left is away from the wall on their right, maybe that's the direction to go. But how to get there? The agent needs to navigate around the walls. 

If there's a wall 4 steps forward, they can't go straight. Maybe they need to turn left or right to find a path. Let's check the direction of the key again. The key is left and forward. If the agent turns left, that direction might be clear. Alternatively, if they turn right, maybe they can go forward and then left. 

Wait, the key is 3 left and 3 forward from the current position. If the agent turns left, then left would be a new direction. Let me visualize this. Suppose the agent is facing north. The wall is 4 steps north, and 2 steps east (right). The key is 3 steps west (left) and 3 steps north (forward). So, if the agent turns left (west), then they could go west 3 steps, then north 3 steps. But there's a wall 4 steps forward (north), so maybe they can't go straight north. Wait, the current observation says a wall 4 steps forward. If they are facing north, forward is north, which is blocked. So to get to the key, which is west and north, they need to turn left (west), go west 3 steps to reach the key's x-coordinate, then turn north (which would be their left again?), but the wall is north. Hmm, maybe not. 

Alternatively, if the agent turns right (east), but there's a wall 2 steps east, so they can go 2 steps east, then maybe turn north or something. Wait, the key's location is 3 left and 3 forward. If the agent is facing north, left is west. So to get to the key, they need to go west 3 and north 3. But the wall is north 4 steps. So going north directly isn't possible. So maybe they need to go west first, then north. But how? If they go west 3 steps, then turn north? But they can't go north past the wall. Wait, maybe the walls are in different directions based on their orientation. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to adjust their direction. Let's think step by step. The key is 3 left and 3 forward. The agent's current forward has a wall. So to get forward, they need to avoid that. Turning left would make their left direction the previous forward. Maybe that's a path. 

If the agent turns left, their new forward direction is where their previous left was. Now, the key is 3 steps left from this new orientation. So left would be the previous backward. Wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should track the agent's direction over time. 

Looking back at the previous actions, the agent was turning left and right alternately. For example, initial steps: turn left, then left again, then right, left, right, etc. This might be them trying to orient themselves. 

In the latest observation, the agent is facing a direction where forward has a wall (4 steps) and right has a wall (2 steps). The key is 3 left (from their current direction) and 3 forward. So left from current direction is one direction, forward is another. To reach the key, they need to move left and forward. But forward is blocked by a wall. 

So maybe they need to turn left to face a new direction where they can move forward towards the key's position. Let's suppose turning left makes their new forward direction aligned with the key's left direction. Then they could go forward towards the key. But need to calculate the coordinates. 

Alternatively, turning right and moving forward might also help. But the wall on the right (2 steps) would limit that. 

Wait, the key is 3 left and 3 forward. If the agent turns left, their left direction becomes the previous direction's forward. So moving left would take them towards where the previous forward was. But the key is 3 left and 3 forward from current position. So if they turn left, then move left (which is the previous forward direction) 3 steps, then they would be at the key's x-coordinate. Then they need to move forward 3 steps, but their current forward direction after turning left would be west (assuming they were facing north initially). Wait, this is getting too complicated without a map. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to go forward 3 steps, but that's blocked. So they need to adjust their direction. Turning left, then moving forward might clear the path. Let's see: if the agent turns left, their forward direction is now west (if they were facing north). The observation says there's a wall 4 steps forward (north), so after turning left, forward is west. Is there a wall west? The observation doesn't mention that. So maybe they can move forward (west) towards the key. 

The key is 3 left (which would be south if facing west) and 3 forward (west). Wait, no. If the agent turns left (west), then their left is south. The key is 3 steps left (south) and 3 forward (west) from their current position. So moving forward (west) 3 steps would get them to the key's x-coordinate, then they need to move left (south) 3 steps. But to get there, after turning left (west), they can go forward (west) 3 steps, then turn south (which is their left now) and go forward 3 steps. But how do they turn south? They would need to turn left again. 

Alternatively, after turning left (west), moving forward 3 steps, then turning left again (south), and moving forward 3 steps. That would reach the key. But the agent needs to do this without hitting walls. 

But the problem is that the current observation doesn't mention walls in those directions. The only walls mentioned are 4 steps forward (original direction) and 2 steps right (original direction's right, which is east). So after turning left (west), the forward direction is west, and there's no wall mentioned there. So moving forward west 3 steps should be possible. Then turning left again (south) and moving forward 3 steps should reach the key. 

So the steps would be: turn left, go forward 3, turn left, go forward 3, then pick up the key. 

But the agent's current observation is: wall 4 forward, wall 2 right, key 3 left and 3 forward. So the agent needs to first turn left to face a direction where they can move towards the key. Let's confirm. If the agent turns left, their left is now the original forward direction. The key is 3 steps left (original forward) and 3 steps forward (new forward, which is original left). So after turning left, moving forward 3 would take them to the key's position. Wait, no. If the agent turns left, their new forward is original left. The key is 3 steps left (original forward) and 3 steps forward (new forward). So to reach the key, from the current position, after turning left, they need to move left (original forward) 3 steps and then forward (new forward) 3 steps. But how? 

Actually, coordinates might be easier. Let's assume the agent is at (0,0). The wall is 4 steps forward. If facing north, the wall is at (0,4). The key is at (-3, 3) because it's 3 steps left (west) and 3 steps forward (north). But the wall at (0,4) blocks the path north. So to get to (-3,3), the agent needs to go west to (-3,0) then north to (-3,3). But the north path from (0,0) is blocked. So they need to find another route. 

Alternatively, if the agent turns left (west), their forward direction is west. They can move west 3 steps to (-3,0), then turn north (which would be their left again) and move north 3 steps to (-3,3), picking up the key. 

But the problem is that the agent's current observation doesn't mention any walls in the west or south directions, except the ones already noted. So the safe action would be to turn left, then go forward. That would move them towards the key's position. 

In the latest observation, after turning left, the forward direction is west, and there's no wall mentioned there. So the next action should be to go forward towards the key.

19,turn left,"<reasoning>
Let me try to figure this out. The goal is to get to the blue key. The current observation says there's a wall 3 steps forward, a wall 2 steps right, and the blue key is 3 steps left and 2 steps forward.

First, I need to determine my current direction. From the previous actions, the agent was turning left and right to navigate around the walls. Let's see the sequence of actions taken so far. The agent turned left, right, left, right, etc., which suggests they might be trying to reorient themselves to face the key.

The key is to the left and forward. If I'm facing a direction where left is the correct path, then turning left might be needed. But considering the walls, I need to make sure there's no wall in the way. The observation mentions a wall 2 steps right, so turning right might not be safe. 

Alternatively, moving forward two steps would get closer to the key, but there's a wall 3 steps forward. Wait, the current observation says a wall 3 steps forward, so moving forward once would be safe? Or maybe the agent is already one step away from the wall. Maybe the agent should adjust direction first. 

If the key is 3 steps left and 2 forward, perhaps the agent needs to face a direction where left and forward align. Let's say the agent is currently facing north. Then left would be west, and moving forward would be north. The key is west (3 steps) and north (2 steps). But there's a wall 3 steps forward (north) and a wall 2 steps right (east). So facing north might not be the right direction. 

Alternatively, if the agent turns left (west), then moving forward might get them closer to the key's west direction. But there's a wall 3 steps forward (west) in that direction. Wait, the observation says a wall 3 steps forward, which would be in the current facing direction. If turning left makes the agent face west, then moving forward would hit the wall. So that's not good.

Hmm. Maybe the agent needs to face a different direction. Let's track previous movements. The agent was turning left and right to avoid walls. Let's assume they are now facing a direction where the key is to the left and forward. For example, suppose the agent is facing east. Then left would be north, and forward is east. The key is 3 steps left (north) and 2 steps forward (east). But there's a wall 3 steps forward (east), so moving forward isn't possible. Instead, turning left (north) and then moving forward might reach the key. But there's a wall 2 steps right (south), which isn't blocking that path. 

Wait, the current observation mentions a wall 2 steps right. If facing east, right would be south. The wall is 2 steps south. So moving north (left) would be clear. Then go forward towards the key. But the key is 3 steps north and 2 steps east. So first, turn left to face north, move forward three times, then turn right to face east and move two steps. But maybe there's a more efficient path. 

Alternatively, if the agent turns right from their current direction. If facing east, right is south. There's a wall 2 steps south, so moving south isn't possible. So turning right is not helpful. 

So the best options seem to be turning left (north) and moving forward. But the key is 3 steps north and 2 steps east. After turning left, moving forward would get closer to the key's north direction, then maybe turn right (east) and move forward. However, each move requires checking for walls. 

Wait, the current observation says the key is 3 steps left and 2 forward. So left and forward from the current direction. Let's say current direction is south. Then left is west, forward is south. Key is west 3 and south 2. But there's a wall 3 steps forward (south), so moving south isn't possible. So turning left (west) and moving forward would hit the wall. That's bad. 

Maybe the agent needs to adjust direction differently. Let's consider the path to the key. The key is at (left 3, forward 2). So from the agent's current position, if they turn left twice (west then north), but that might complicate. Alternatively, turn around. If the agent turns 180 degrees (two right turns), facing south. Then left would be east, forward is south. The key is west 3 and south 2. So facing south, moving forward 2 steps would get to the key's south position, but there's a wall 3 steps forward (south), so that's not possible. 

This is getting a bit confusing. Let me look at the last few observations. 

Previous observations showed the key at different positions relative to the agent's movements. The agent was oscillating between turning left and right, trying to position themselves. 

In the last observation before the current one, the key was 3 steps left and 3 steps forward. The agent turned right, then left, right, etc. Now, the key is 3 steps left and 2 forward. 

The current walls are 3 steps forward and 2 steps right. So if the agent wants to move towards the key, which is left and forward, they need to ensure they're not blocked by walls. 

Perhaps the agent should first check if they can move forward without hitting the wall. The wall is 3 steps forward, meaning if they move one step, they're still safe. So moving forward once would reduce the distance to the wall. Then adjust direction to face left towards the key. 

Alternatively, turn left to face the direction where the key's left and forward are. Let me think. If the agent turns left, their new direction would be left relative to their current facing. Suppose they turn left, now facing north (if previous direction was west). Then moving forward towards north would get closer to the key's left (north) direction. But the key is also 2 steps forward in that direction. 

This is tricky. Maybe the best action is to turn left to face the direction where the key is to the left and forward. Wait, the key is 3 steps left and 2 forward from the current position. So left would be the direction perpendicular to the agent's current facing. If the agent turns left, then their left is now the direction towards the key. Then moving forward towards the key. But there's a wall 3 steps forward in the current direction, but after turning left, the forward direction would be different. 

Alternatively, after turning left, the agent's forward direction is now where the key's left is. Wait, no. Let me clarify. Suppose the agent is facing east. The key is 3 steps left (north) and 2 steps forward (east). If the agent turns left (north), then their forward direction is north. The key is 3 steps north (left from their new forward direction?) No, the key's position is relative to the agent's original position. 

This might require a different approach. Maybe the agent needs to navigate around the walls to reach the key's tile. Since the key is 3 left and 2 forward, and there's a wall 3 steps forward, the agent can't go straight forward. So they need to turn left (which would be north if facing east) and move forward. But how many steps? 

Wait, the agent's current observation says the key is 3 steps left and 2 forward. So in the agent's current orientation, left is one direction and forward is another. To reach the key, they need to adjust their direction so that moving forward and left gets them there. 

Alternatively, perhaps the agent needs to turn right to face a direction where the key is in front. But given the walls, that might not be possible. 

Given the current walls: 3 steps forward (which direction depends on the agent's facing) and 2 steps right. The key is 3 left and 2 forward. The safest bet is to first turn left to avoid the wall in front, then move forward. But need to check if that aligns with the key's position. 

Assuming the agent turns left, their new forward direction is where the key's left is. Then moving forward towards the key. But the key is 3 steps left and 2 forward. If after turning left, moving forward 2 steps would reach the key's forward direction, and then left 3 steps. But maybe the agent can move forward first, then adjust. 

Alternatively, since the key is 3 steps left and 2 forward, the agent could turn left, move forward 2 steps (since forward is now the direction towards the key's forward), then turn left again and move 3 steps. But that might require checking for walls. 

But given the current observation, the agent cannot move forward 3 steps because there's a wall 3 steps forward. So moving forward once is safe. Then adjust direction. 

In the current observation, the key is 3 left and 2 forward. The agent needs to align their direction to face left and forward. The best action might be to turn left to face the direction where the key is to the left, then move forward. 

Alternatively, turn right to face a different direction, but there's a wall 2 steps right. 

So the most logical action here is to turn left, which would allow moving towards the key's position without hitting the wall in front. Then move forward once. 

Therefore, the chosen action is to turn left.

20,Failed to obtain a valid action from the reasoning.,"<reasoning>
Let me try to figure out what to do here. The current observation says there's a wall 5 steps forward and another wall 3 steps to the right. The blue key is located 2 steps to the right and 3 steps forward.

First, I need to understand my current direction. Earlier actions involved turning left and right, but since the walls are in specific positions, maybe I'm facing a particular direction. Let's imagine I'm facing north initially. If there's a wall 4 steps forward initially, that might be north. Then turning left would face west, and so on. But maybe I'm getting confused with the directions here.

Looking at the latest observation: walls forward and to the right, key is to the right and forward. So if I'm facing a direction where forward has a wall 5 steps ahead and right has a wall 3 steps, the key is 2 right and 3 forward. Maybe I need to adjust my direction to face towards where the key is.

Since the key is to the right and forward, maybe I should turn right to align myself, then go forward towards it. But I need to check if there's a path. If I turn right, then my forward direction would be where the key's forward is. But after turning right, I need to see if there's a path. However, the current observation doesn't mention obstacles in other directions, just forward and right. 

Wait, the walls are in specific positions relative to my current facing. If I turn right, then my new forward direction might be clear towards the key. Alternatively, if I turn left, maybe that's also a path. But the key is 2 steps right and 3 steps forward. So perhaps I need to turn right first to face the direction where the key is. Then move forward 3 steps and right 2 steps. But each move is one step at a time.

Alternatively, maybe I can adjust my direction to face east (assuming initial direction was north). Then, turning right would face south, but that might not be the way. Hmm, maybe I need to first turn right to face east, then go forward 3 steps, and turn right again to face south, then go right 2 steps. But the key is 2 right and 3 forward. So maybe the key is in a position that requires moving in two directions. 

Wait, but each move is one step. So I need to first align my direction correctly. Let's see: if I'm facing north, and the key is 2 steps east (right) and 3 steps north (forward), then I need to keep facing north, turn right (east), go forward 3 steps, then turn right again (south), and go forward 2 steps. But according to the current observation, there's a wall 5 steps forward (north) and a wall 3 steps right (east). So if I'm facing north, moving forward would hit the wall, but the key is north of that. That doesn't make sense. Maybe my initial assumption about the direction is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm facing east. Then, forward would be east, right would be south. The wall 5 steps forward would be east, and wall 3 steps right (south). The key is 2 steps right (south) and 3 steps forward (east). But if forward is east, then 3 steps east would take me past the wall which is 5 steps east. That can't be. Hmm, maybe I'm facing west. Then forward is west, right is north. The wall 5 steps forward (west) and wall 3 steps right (north). The key is 2 steps right (north) and 3 steps forward (west). But the wall is 5 steps west, so moving forward 3 steps west would still be clear until the wall. So maybe I can face west, turn right (north), go 2 steps north to reach the key's north position, then turn left (west) and go 3 steps. But that might not be efficient.

Alternatively, maybe I need to use toggle or pick up, but there's no door or object to toggle here. The key is on the ground, so I need to approach it. The problem is navigating around the walls to get to the key's position. 

Looking at the latest observation: walls forward (5 steps) and right (3 steps), key is 2 right and 3 forward. So if I'm facing a direction where forward is blocked by a wall, and right is also blocked, but the key is to the right and forward relative to my current position. Wait, that might mean that the key is in a position that's diagonally forward and right from me, but with walls blocking straight paths. 

So maybe I need to turn in such a way that I can approach the key without hitting the walls. For example, if I turn right, then my forward direction would be where the right wall was, which is 3 steps. But the key is 2 steps right and 3 forward from my current position. If turning right makes my forward direction aligned with the original right direction (which had a wall 3 steps away), but the key is 2 steps right (in the original direction) and 3 forward (original forward). So if I turn right, my new forward is original right, which is blocked by a wall 3 steps. So I can't go straight forward. But the key is 2 steps in the original right (which is my new forward direction) and 3 steps in original forward (which is my left direction). Wait, this is getting confusing.

Alternatively, maybe I should turn left. If I turn left, my new forward direction is original left, which had a wall 2 steps left in previous observations. But in the current observation, the walls are 5 steps forward and 3 steps right. So if I turn left, forward would be left, which might have a wall 2 steps away. But the key is 2 steps right and 3 forward. So right from my new forward (left direction) would be original direction. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I need to go forward slightly to see if the wall is closer. But the observation says 5 steps forward, so moving forward once would make it 4 steps. But if there's a wall 5 steps away, moving forward once would still have a wall 4 steps ahead. That might not help.

Alternatively, maybe the key is in a position that requires moving around the walls. For instance, if I go forward a few steps until the wall is closer, then turn right or left to navigate around. But given the current observation, the key is 2 right and 3 forward. So perhaps I need to move forward 3 steps (but there's a wall 5 steps forward, so that's not possible). Wait, maybe my current position is such that moving forward 3 steps would hit the wall, but the key is beyond that. That doesn't make sense. Maybe the walls are in different directions based on my orientation.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to adjust my direction to face the key directly. Since the key is 2 right and 3 forward, the direction towards the key is northeast if I'm facing north. So if I turn right (east), then go forward 3 steps, then turn right again (south), and go forward 2 steps. But in the current observation, turning right would face east, which has a wall 3 steps away. So moving forward 3 steps east would hit the wall. That's a problem.

Alternatively, if I turn left (west), then my forward direction is west, which has a wall 5 steps away. So moving forward there is blocked. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the walls are in different directions based on my current orientation. Let me think differently. Let's assume that the agent is facing north initially. Then, the first observation had a wall 4 steps forward (north) and a wall 2 steps left (west). The agent turned right (now facing east), then the next observation had a wall 2 steps forward (east) and a wall 3 steps left (north). Then turned right again (south), etc. This seems to form a pattern where the agent is moving around a rectangle, trying to find the key.

But in the latest observations, the key is located at 2 steps right and 3 steps forward from the current position. So depending on the agent's current direction, that position could vary. For example, if the agent is facing north, right would be east, so the key is 2 east and 3 north. But there's a wall 5 steps north, so that can't be. Alternatively, if facing east, right is south, so key is 2 south and 3 east. But the wall is 5 steps east, so 3 steps east would still be clear. Then, turning right (south) and moving 2 steps, then turning left (east) and moving 3 steps. But the wall is 5 steps east, so moving 3 steps east would be possible. But how does that match the current observation?

Alternatively, maybe the agent is facing south. Then forward is south, right is east. The wall 5 steps forward would be south, and the wall 3 steps right (east). The key is 2 steps right (east) and 3 steps forward (south). But moving south 3 steps would hit the wall at 5 steps. So that's not possible.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should try to find a path that avoids the walls. The key is in a position that's 2 right and 3 forward. So perhaps the agent needs to turn right, then move forward until the wall is out of the way, then turn right again and move towards the key. But I need to check the current observation.

In the current observation, walls are 5 steps forward and 3 steps right. The key is 2 right and 3 forward. So if I turn right, my new forward direction is where the right wall was (3 steps). So moving forward in that direction would hit the wall. But the key is 2 steps in that direction (right) and 3 steps forward (original forward). Wait, this is confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the agent should first move forward a few steps to reduce the distance to the wall, then turn. For example, if I go forward once, the wall would be 4 steps away. Still too far. Going forward twice, wall at 3 steps. Still there. But the key is 3 steps forward from current position. So if there's a wall 5 steps forward, moving forward 3 steps would hit the wall. That can't be right. Therefore, the agent must be facing a direction where the forward path is blocked by a wall, but the key is in that direction beyond the wall. That's impossible unless there's a door, but the problem states there's no door mentioned. So maybe the walls are not solid, or the key is in a different position.

Alternatively, maybe the agent's current position is such that the key is behind a wall, but that doesn't make sense. The key should be accessible.

Wait, the problem might be that the agent is not facing the correct direction to approach the key. Let's try to map out possible directions.

Assume the agent is initially facing north. Observations show walls in certain directions. The key's position relative to the agent changes as the agent moves and turns.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is in a position that requires the agent to navigate around the walls in a specific path. For example, move forward until a wall is encountered, then turn left or right to find a path towards the key.

But given the current observation, the agent is facing a direction where forward is blocked by a wall 5 steps away, and right is blocked by a wall 3 steps away. The key is 2 steps to the right and 3 steps forward. So if the agent turns right, their new forward direction is where the right wall was (3 steps). The key is 2 steps to the right of that (which would be original direction) and 3 steps forward (new forward direction). But moving forward 3 steps in the new direction would hit the wall. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, if the agent turns left, their new forward direction is original left. The key is 2 steps right (original direction) and 3 steps forward (new forward direction). So from the agent's current position, turning left, moving forward some steps, then turning right (original direction) to approach the key.

But in the current observation, turning left would face a wall 2 steps away. So moving forward once would get to the wall. Not helpful.

Hmm. Maybe the agent needs to go around the walls. For example, move forward until the wall is at a closer distance, then turn to head towards the key. But with the current observation, moving forward would reduce the wall distance but still hit it eventually.

Alternatively, maybe the agent should toggle something, but there's no objects to interact with except the key. The key is on the ground, so the agent needs to move to it and then pick it up.

Wait, the key's position is 2 steps right and 3 steps forward. So regardless of direction, the agent needs to move in those relative directions. If the agent can align themselves so that moving forward and right leads them to the key without hitting walls, that would work.

But given the current walls, perhaps the agent needs to turn right, then move forward until the wall is out of the way, then turn right again and move towards the key. But in the current observation, turning right would face a wall 3 steps away. So moving forward there is blocked.

Alternatively, maybe the agent should first move forward a few steps to reduce the wall distance, then turn. For example, go forward once (now wall is 4 steps forward), then turn right. Now, forward direction is original right (which had a wall 3 steps away). Move forward until the wall is at 3 steps, then turn right again and move towards the key. But I'm not sure.

This is tricky. Maybe the best action here is to turn right, as that might align the agent's direction to face where the key is located, assuming the agent's current orientation is correct. Alternatively, turn left to see if that opens up a path.

In the current observation, the walls are 5 forward and 3 right. The key is 2 right and 3 forward. So if I turn right, my new forward is original right (which has a wall 3 steps). The key is 2 steps in original right (which is new forward) and 3 steps original forward. So from the agent's perspective after turning right, the key is 2 steps forward and 3 steps left (original direction). But how to get there without hitting the wall.

Alternatively, maybe after turning right, the agent should move forward 2 steps (but wall is 3 steps away), so can't. Then turn left (original direction) and move forward 3 steps. But original forward has a wall 5 steps away. That would hit the wall.

Hmm. This is confusing. Maybe I need to try a different approach. Let's look at the previous steps to see if there's a pattern.

The agent has been turning left and right repeatedly, trying to navigate around the walls. The key's position has been changing slightly each time. Maybe the agent is moving in a square, getting closer to the key each time.

In the latest observation, the key is 2 steps right and 3 forward. So if the agent can align themselves so that moving right and forward gets them to the key, that's the goal. Perhaps the agent needs to turn right, then move forward 3 steps (but there's a wall), which isn't possible. So instead, they need to adjust their direction differently.

Wait, maybe the agent should first move forward a couple of steps to get past the wall, but according to the current observation, moving forward would still hit the wall in 5 steps. So that's not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe the agent should drop something, but they're not holding anything. The only action needed is to reach the key and pick it up.

Another idea: since the key is 2 steps right and 3 forward, the agent needs to move in those relative directions. If the agent is facing a direction where 'right' aligns with the key's x-coordinate and 'forward' aligns with the key's y-coordinate, then moving right twice and forward three times would reach the key. But the problem is the walls blocking the path.

Alternatively, maybe the agent can toggle an object, but there's nothing to toggle except the key once they're on it.

Wait, the key is on the ground, so when the agent is on the same spot as the key, they can pick it up. So the agent needs to navigate to the key's position.

Assuming the agent's current position is (0,0), and the key is at (2,3), but the walls are in the way. The agent needs to find a path to (2,3) without hitting walls.

But given the current observation, the walls are 5 steps forward and 3 steps right. So if the agent is facing north, the walls are at (0,5) forward and (3,0) right. The key is at (2,3). So the path would be east 2, north 3. But facing north, moving east would be right, but there's a wall 3 steps east. So can't go straight east.

Alternatively, face east, move south 3 steps (which is the agent's left direction), then move east 2 steps. But facing east, forward is east, which has a wall 5 steps away. So moving south isn't possible unless there's a path.

This is really confusing. Maybe the best action here is to turn right, then move forward as much as possible, then adjust. But the current observation doesn't allow that.

Alternatively, the agent should go forward once to reduce the wall distance, then turn right or left. For example, go forward once (now wall is 4 steps forward), then turn right. Now, forward is original right (wall at 3 steps). Move forward once (now wall at 2 steps). Then turn right again (now facing original direction). Move forward 3 steps. But original forward has a wall at 5 steps, so moving 3 steps would still be safe until the wall. But the key is 3 steps forward from original position. So if the agent moves forward 3 steps after turning right twice, they would reach the key. But I need to verify the directions.

Alternatively, after turning right twice (facing original direction), moving forward 3 steps would take them to the key's position. But if there's a wall 5 steps forward, moving 3 steps would be possible. So maybe the agent should turn right, go forward a few steps, turn right again, and then go forward 3 steps.

But how to execute this in the current step. The current observation says walls are 5 forward and 3 right. The key is 2 right and 3 forward. So if the agent turns right, their new forward is original right (wall at 3 steps). They can't move forward there. So instead, they need to turn left. Turning left would face original left, which has a wall 2 steps away. Move forward once, hit the wall. Not helpful","

21,turn right,"<reasoning>
Let's see what's going on here. The goal is to get to the blue key. The current observation says there's a wall 4 steps forward, a wall 3 steps to the right, and the blue key is 2 steps right and 2 steps forward from my current position.

Hmm, so I need to figure out how to reach the key without hitting the walls. Let me visualize this. If the walls are in those directions, maybe I'm facing a certain direction. Let's say I'm facing north for example. If there's a wall 4 steps forward (north), then going straight won't work. The wall to the right (east) is 3 steps away. The key is 2 steps east and 2 steps north. But since there's a wall directly north, I can't go forward past that. So maybe I need to adjust my direction to approach the key from another angle.

Wait, if the key is east and north but there's a wall north, maybe I need to go around the wall. Let me check the previous observations. Earlier, the agent was turning left and right a lot, probably trying to find a path. Now the key is 2 steps east and 2 steps north. If there's a wall north, but maybe I can turn east (right) and then go forward until I can't, then turn north? But the wall is only 3 steps to the right. If I go right (east) past the wall, that's not possible. Wait, the wall is 3 steps to the right. So if I'm facing north, my right is east. The wall is 3 steps east. But the key is 2 steps east and 2 steps north. So from my current position, if I turn right (east), I can move towards the key's east direction. But the wall is 3 steps east, so moving east might hit the wall. Wait, but the key is only 2 steps east. So maybe if I go east 1 step, then north? But the wall is 4 steps north. Wait, I'm confused.

Alternatively, maybe the agent should turn left to face west and then move forward, but that's a wall. No, the walls are in different directions. Let me think again. The key is 2 east and 2 north. The walls are 4 north and 3 east. So if I turn right (east), I can go 2 steps east to reach the key's east position. Then turn north? But the wall is 4 steps north. Wait, no. If I'm facing east after turning right, moving forward would take me east. The key is 2 east, so moving forward twice would get me there. But then I need to go north. But the wall is 4 steps north from the original position. Wait, maybe the walls are relative to the agent's current direction. So if the agent is facing north, the walls are 4 steps north and 3 steps east. The key is 2 steps east and 2 steps north. So from the current position, turning right (east) and moving 2 steps forward would get me to the key's east position. Then turning north (since originally facing north, after turning right, facing east, turning left would face north) and moving 2 steps forward, but the wall is 4 steps north from the original position. Wait, but if I moved 2 steps east, then the wall is 4 steps north from the original position, which would be 2 steps north from the new position. So moving north 2 steps from there would hit the wall. That's a problem.

Hmm, maybe the agent needs to adjust its direction differently. Let's try another approach. If the key is 2 east and 2 north, and there's a wall 4 north, perhaps the agent should first move east towards the key, then try to go north around the wall. But the wall is 4 steps north, so if the agent moves east 2 steps, then turns north (which would be left from the original facing), and moves forward, but the wall is 4 steps north from the original position. Wait, after moving east 2 steps, the agent's new position is 2 east of the original. The wall is 4 steps north from the original, so from the new position, the wall is 4 - 2 = 2 steps north. So moving north from there would hit the wall. That's still a problem.

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to go in a different direction. Suppose the agent turns left (west) and moves forward. But there's a wall 5 steps forward in previous observations. Wait, in the current observation, the wall is 4 steps forward. So moving forward would get closer to the wall. That's not good. So turning left (west) and moving forward is bad. Turning right (east) might be possible if the path isn't blocked. Wait, the wall is 3 steps east, so moving right (east) 3 steps would hit the wall. But the key is only 2 steps east. So moving east 2 steps would reach the key's position. Then, from there, how to go north? But the wall is 4 steps north from the original position. If the agent is now 2 steps east, the wall is 2 steps north from there. So moving north would hit the wall. That's a problem. So maybe the agent can't reach the key by going east first.

Wait, maybe the agent needs to go around the wall. If the wall is 4 steps north, but the key is only 2 steps north and east, perhaps the agent can go around the wall to the east side. Let's say the agent turns right (east), moves 1 step (not hitting the wall), then turns north (left from east facing) and moves forward. But how many steps? The key is 2 steps east and 2 steps north. So from the original position, if the agent moves east 1 step, then north 2 steps, that would get to the key. But the wall is 4 steps north, so from the original position, moving north 2 steps would be okay because the wall is 4 steps away. Wait, maybe the agent's current position has the wall 4 steps forward (north). So moving north (forward) 2 steps would reach the key's north position, but then the wall is 4 steps from the original, so 2 steps forward would not hit the wall. Then, from there, moving east 2 steps would get to the key. But that's the opposite direction. Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, maybe the agent should move forward towards the key's direction. The key is 2 east and 2 north. If the agent's current direction is such that moving forward would take them north, but there's a wall 4 steps north. So moving forward isn't possible. Therefore, the agent needs to adjust direction to approach the key diagonally or from another angle. Maybe turning right (east) and moving forward 2 steps to reach the key's east position, then turning north (left) and moving forward until the wall is encountered. But the wall is 4 steps north from the original, so after moving east 2 steps, the wall is 2 steps north. So moving north 2 steps would hit the wall. That's not good. 

Wait, maybe the agent can pick up the key once it's in position. But the key is 2 steps east and 2 steps north. If the agent can get to that position, then use 'pick up' action. But how to get there without hitting the wall. Let me try to plan the path again. 

Current position: facing a direction where forward is north (wall 4 steps ahead), right (east) has a wall 3 steps away. Key is at 2 east and 2 north. 

Possible path: Turn right (east), move 1 step (since wall is 3 steps east, moving 1 step is safe). Then turn left (now facing north), move forward 2 steps. Now, agent is 1 east and 2 north. From there, turn right (east) and move 1 step to reach the key's position. Then pick up. 

But in the current observation, after moving forward, the key's position is 2 right and 2 forward. So maybe the agent needs to adjust directions step by step. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent should first move forward 2 steps to reduce the distance to the wall. But moving forward would take them north, closer to the wall. 

Wait, the current observation says the wall is 4 steps forward. So if the agent moves forward once, they're 3 steps from the wall. Still dangerous. If they move forward twice, they're 2 steps from the wall. Still can't go further. 

So perhaps the agent needs to turn left or right to avoid the wall and approach the key. Let's try turning left (west). Then the wall is 5 steps forward. So moving forward west would be possible. But the key is east and north. Maybe this isn't helpful. 

Alternatively, turning right (east), moving 1 step, then turning north (left), moving 2 steps. Now the agent is 1 east and 2 north. Then turning right (east) and moving 1 step to reach the key. That would get them to the key's position. Then 'pick up'. 

But how does the agent know to do that? The problem is that the agent has to figure out the sequence of turns and moves based on the observations. 

Given the observations so far, the agent has been turning left and right to navigate around walls. Now, with the key at 2 east and 2 north, but walls in those directions, the agent needs to plan a path that goes around the walls to reach the key. 

So the correct action here would be to turn right (east), move forward 1 step (since the wall is 3 steps east, moving 1 is safe), then turn left (north), move forward 2 steps, then turn right (east), move forward 1 step to reach the key. Then 'pick up'. 

But the agent can only take one action at a time. So in the current observation, the key is 2 east and 2 north. The agent needs to decide the next action. Let's look at the latest observation: 

Observation:
a wall 4 steps forward
a wall 3 steps right
a blue key 2 steps right and 2 steps forward

So the agent is facing a direction where forward is north (wall 4 steps ahead), right is east (wall 3 steps east), and the key is 2 east and 2 north. 

To reach the key, the agent needs to go east 2 steps and north 2 steps. But moving north is blocked by a wall 4 steps away. So the agent must go around the wall by adjusting direction. 

The optimal path would be to turn right (east), move 1 step (safe since wall is 3 steps east), then turn left (north), move 2 steps. That gets the agent to 1 east and 2 north. Then turn right (east) again, move 1 step to reach the key's position. 

But the agent can only take one action per turn. So the next action should be to turn right (east) to face the east direction, allowing them to move towards the key's east position. 

Alternatively, if the agent is already facing east, they could move forward. But in the current observation, after previous actions, the agent's direction isn't specified. However, based on the sequence of turns (turn left, right, left, etc.), perhaps the agent's current direction is such that turning right again would face east. 

Assuming the agent needs to face east to move towards the key's east position, the next action would be 'turn right'. Then move forward twice. But since the agent can only take one action, 'turn right' is the immediate next step. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent should first move forward as much as possible in a safe direction. But moving forward would be north, which has a wall 4 steps away. Moving forward once would get them 3 steps from the wall. Not helpful. 

So the best immediate action is to turn right to face east, allowing them to move towards the key's east position. Once facing east, the next action would be 'go forward' twice. Then turn left to face north, move forward twice. Then pick up. 

But given that the agent can only do one action per turn, the first action should be to turn right. 

Looking back at the previous actions, the agent has been turning left and right repeatedly. Maybe they need to align their direction correctly. 

In the current observation, the key is 2 right and 2 forward. If the agent turns right (east), then their forward direction is east. The key is 2 steps east and 2 steps north. So after turning right, moving forward once gets them 1 east. Then they need to turn north (left) and move forward 2 steps. Then turn right (east) and move forward once more to reach the key. 

But again, only one action can be taken now. So the next logical step is to turn right to face east, allowing them to move towards the key's east position. 

Therefore, the chosen action is 'turn right'.

a blue key 2 steps left and 2 steps forward",0,False
22,turn left,"<reasoning>
I need to get to the blue key. Let me look at the current observation.

The observation says there's a wall 3 steps forward, a wall 3 steps to the right, and the blue key is 2 steps left and 2 steps forward. 

So, right now, I'm probably facing a direction where forward is blocked by a wall. The key is to the left and a bit forward. How do I get there without hitting the walls? 

Let me visualize this. If there's a wall 3 steps forward, I can't go straight. The key is 2 steps left and 2 steps forward. Maybe I should turn left to face a direction where I can move towards the key. 

If I turn left, then my forward direction would be where the key's left is. Wait, the key is to the left (from my current position) and 2 steps forward. So if I turn left, I can go forward 2 steps to reach the key's position. But wait, after turning left, my forward direction would be north, assuming I was initially facing east. The key is 2 left (west) and 2 forward (north). So turning left would face me north, and then moving forward 2 steps would get me to the key's position. 

But wait, the observation says the key is 2 steps left and 2 steps forward from my current position. So if I turn left, then moving forward 2 steps would align me with the key. But I need to check if the path is clear. Let me think again. The walls are 3 steps forward and 3 steps right. So if I'm currently facing east, forward is east (blocked), right is south (blocked). Turning left would face north. The key is west (2 steps) and north (2 steps). So from current position, after turning left, moving forward 2 steps would take me north 2, then west 2? Or is it that the key is 2 steps left (west) and 2 steps forward (north) from my current direction. 

Wait, directions can be confusing. Let me break it down. Suppose I'm facing east. Current position: 

- Forward (east) is blocked by a wall 3 steps away. 
- Right (south) is blocked by a wall 3 steps. 
- The blue key is 2 steps left (west) and 2 steps forward (east). Wait, that can't be. If the key is 2 steps left (west) and 2 steps forward (east), that would place it in a direction that's northwest from my current position. But if I'm facing east, moving left (west) would be to the west direction. Hmm, maybe the description is relative to my current facing. 

Wait, the observation says ""blue key 3 steps left and 3 steps forward"" in the previous turns, but now it's ""2 steps left and 2 steps forward"". Let me clarify. The key's position is relative to the agent's current orientation. So if the agent is facing north, then left would be west, right would be east. 

Assuming the current observation has the key 2 steps left and 2 steps forward. Let's say I'm facing north. Then left is west, so the key is 2 west and 2 north from my current position. But there's a wall 3 steps forward (north) and 3 steps right (east). So moving forward north 3 steps is blocked. But the key is only 2 steps north and 2 west. So if I turn left (west), then move forward 2 steps, that would take me west 2, which is towards the key. But then I need to adjust my direction to face north-west? Wait, maybe I need to first turn left (west) and then move forward, but that might not get me to the key. 

Alternatively, if I turn left (west), then move forward 2 steps to the west, then turn north (which would be my left turn again?), but that might not be necessary. Wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should try to navigate step by step. 

Current position: facing east (since forward is blocked by a wall to the east, right is south blocked). The key is 2 steps west and 2 steps north. So from here, to get to the key, I need to go west 2 and north 2. But since moving north directly is blocked (wall 3 steps forward which is north), I need to find another path. 

If I turn left (north), then move forward 1 step. But there's a wall 3 steps forward in that direction, so after turning north, moving forward would hit the wall. That's not good. 

If I turn right (south), but there's a wall 3 steps to the right (south). So moving south is blocked. 

Wait, perhaps I need to first adjust my direction. Let's try turning left (north), but that's blocked. So maybe turn around? Turn left twice to face west. Then move forward 2 steps west, which would take me to the key's west position. Then, from there, turn north (which would be my left turn) and move forward 2 steps. That would get me to the key. 

But the key is 2 steps left and 2 steps forward from my current position. So if I turn left (north), then the key is 2 steps west and 2 steps north. Wait, maybe the key is in the northwest direction. So after turning left (north), moving forward 2 steps would take me north 2, then I need to go west 2. But how? Because after moving north 2, my position is 2 steps north. Now, west would be left from my new facing (north). So turn left again (west) and move 2 steps. 

But in the current observation, after turning left, the walls are 3 steps forward (north) and 3 steps right (east). So moving north is blocked after 3 steps, but the key is only 2 steps north. Wait, but if I move north 2 steps, then I can continue west. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a better path. Let's see. From the current position, facing east, walls to east and south. Key is west 2 and north 2. 

If I turn left (north), move forward 2 steps (since the wall is 3 steps north, but key is 2 steps north). So moving north 2 steps gets me to a position where I'm 2 north, 0 east, 0 west. Then, from there, turn left again (west) and move 2 steps. That would reach the key. 

But the problem is that in the current observation, when I turned left (north), the wall is 3 steps forward. So moving forward north 2 steps is possible, as the wall is 3 steps away. So yes, I can move forward 2 steps north. Then turn left (west) and move 2 steps. 

So the actions would be: turn left, go forward, turn left, go forward. But the agent can only take one action per turn. So in the current step, the observation is that the key is 2 left and 2 forward. So maybe the best action is to turn left to face north, then go forward 2 steps. But wait, the agent can only take one action at a time. So first, turn left (to face north), then next action would be go forward. But in the current observation, the agent is still facing east. 

Wait, the current observation is after previous actions. Let me recheck. The last observation before this one was:

Observation:
a wall 5 steps forward
a wall 3 steps left
a blue key 3 steps right and 3 steps forward

Then the assistant turned right, and now the current observation is:

Current Observation:
a wall 3 steps forward
a wall 3 steps right
a blue key 2 steps left and 2 steps forward

So the agent's current facing direction is such that forward is blocked by a wall 3 steps away, right is blocked by a wall 3 steps, and the key is 2 steps left and 2 steps forward. 

Assuming that turning left would face the agent north, and turning right would face south. 

So to get to the key, which is 2 left (west) and 2 forward (north) from current position, the agent needs to adjust direction. 

If the agent is facing east (since forward is east, blocked), then left is north, right is south. 

The key is 2 west (left) and 2 north (forward). So from current position, turning left (north) and moving forward 2 steps would get to the key's north position, then turning left again (west) and moving 2 steps. But again, the agent can only do one action at a time. 

So the first action should be to turn left (north) to face the direction where the key is north. Then, move forward 2 steps. But how does the agent know how many steps to move? The problem states that each 'go forward' action takes one step. So the agent needs to move forward two times. But in the current step, the agent can only choose one action. So the next best action is to turn left to face north, then in the next step, go forward. 

But in the current observation, the agent needs to choose an action now. The key is 2 left and 2 forward. So turning left (north) would align the agent to face the direction where the key is 2 steps forward (north) and 2 steps left (west). Wait, no. If the agent turns left (north), then the key is 2 steps to the left (west) and 2 steps forward (north). So from the agent's new facing (north), the key is west 2 and north 2. 

So to reach the key, the agent needs to go west 2 and north 2. But moving north is blocked by a wall 3 steps away. Wait, no. The wall is 3 steps forward from the current position (which is east). After turning left (north), the wall is now 3 steps forward in the north direction. The key is 2 steps forward (north) and 2 steps left (west) from the agent's new position. 

So moving forward 2 steps (north) would get the agent to a position where they can then turn left (west) and move 2 steps. 

But since the agent can only take one action per turn, the first action should be to turn left (to face north), then in the next step, go forward. 

So the best action now is to turn left. That way, the agent is facing the direction where the key is north, and then they can move forward. 

Alternatively, maybe turning right (south) isn't helpful because there's a wall there. 

Another option: If the agent turns left twice (180 degrees), facing west, then moves forward 2 steps west, which would take them to the key's west position, and then turn north (left again) and move 2 steps. But that would take multiple steps. 

But given the current observation, the immediate action should be to turn left to face north, allowing the agent to proceed towards the key. 

So the chosen action is turn left.

Let's see. The goal is to get to the blue key. The current observation says there's a wall 4 steps forward, a wall 3 steps right, and the blue key is 2 steps right and 2 steps forward from my current position.

So, I need to figure out the direction to the key. If the key is 2 steps right and 2 steps forward, that means I need to go right twice and then forward twice. But there's a wall 3 steps right. Wait, does that mean straight right is blocked? The wall is 3 steps right, so if I'm facing a direction where right is blocked, I might need to turn.

Let me check the previous actions. The last actions were turning right and left alternately, trying to navigate around walls. The key's position is 2 steps right and 2 forward, so maybe I need to face a direction where moving right and forward is possible.

If I'm currently facing north, for example, and there's a wall 4 steps forward, then north might be blocked. The key is 2 steps right and 2 forward. If right from north is east, then to get to the key, I need to go east twice and north twice. But if east is blocked by a wall 3 steps right, then maybe I need to adjust my direction.

Alternatively, perhaps the agent is facing a direction where turning left or right would allow movement towards the key without hitting the walls. Let's think about the agent's orientation. Suppose the agent is facing south. Then, moving forward would be south, but there's a wall 4 steps forward. So maybe the agent turned right (now facing east) but the wall is 3 steps right (east), so moving east three steps is blocked. The key is 2 steps right (east) and 2 steps forward (north). If the agent is facing east, moving forward would be east, which is blocked by a wall 3 steps right. Wait, maybe I got the directions confused.

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to adjust their orientation to face a direction where both right and forward movements towards the key are possible. Let's visualize the grid. Let's assume the agent is at position (0,0). The key is at (2,2) relative to the agent's current position. The walls are 4 steps forward (so in the forward direction, there's a wall 4 units away) and 3 steps right (so in the right direction, a wall 3 units away).

If the agent is facing north, then forward is north, right is east. The wall 4 steps forward is north, and wall 3 steps right is east. The key is at 2 east and 2 north. So from (0,0), the key is at (2,2). To get there, the agent needs to move east twice and north twice. But moving east twice would require that there's no wall in the east direction. However, the observation says there's a wall 3 steps right (east), so moving east three steps is blocked. But the key is only 2 steps east. So maybe the wall is beyond the key's position. So the agent can move east twice, then north twice, avoiding the wall.

But how to approach that. If the agent is facing north, and wants to go east, they need to turn right (to face east). Then move forward twice. Then turn left (back to north) and move forward twice. But the problem is the agent's current facing direction. Let's track the agent's orientation based on previous actions.

Looking back at the history, the agent was turning right and left alternately. Let's say the agent started facing north. Then turned right (east), then left (north), then right (east), etc. But the walls are in certain directions. Let's reconstruct:

In previous observations, when the agent turned right, the walls shifted. For example, after turning right, the wall that was 5 steps forward might have moved. But perhaps the agent's orientation is such that they need to face a direction where they can move towards the key without hitting walls.

Alternatively, maybe the agent should first align their direction to face east, then move forward twice to reach the key's east position, then turn north and move forward. But if there's a wall 3 steps east (right), but the key is only 2 steps east, then that's okay. The wall is beyond the key. So moving east twice would be possible.

So the steps would be: turn right (to face east), go forward twice (reaching the key's east position), then turn left (to face north), go forward twice. But the agent needs to check if moving forward is possible each time.

Alternatively, the agent might be facing a different direction. If the agent is facing east, then moving forward would be east, which has a wall 3 steps away, but the key is 2 steps east and 2 steps north. So first, turn north (left from east), then go forward twice (north), then turn east (right), go forward twice. But the wall in front (north) is 4 steps away, but the key is only 2 steps north. So moving north twice would be possible.

But how to determine the current facing direction. The agent's previous actions might have changed their direction. For example, if the agent turned right multiple times, they could be facing different directions.

Given the uncertainty in the agent's current orientation, maybe the best approach is to alternate turning right and left to reorient, then move forward when possible.

In the current observation, the agent is facing a direction where forward has a wall 4 steps away, right has a wall 3 steps. The key is 2 right and 2 forward. So if the agent turns right (new direction is east), then the wall is 3 steps east, but the key is 2 steps east. So moving east twice would reach the key's east position. Then turn left (north) and move forward twice.

But how to confirm the agent's current direction. Since previous actions included turning right and left, perhaps the agent is facing a direction where turning right once would align them to face east, allowing movement towards the key.

So the action would be to turn right, then go forward twice. But the agent needs to execute each step. However, in the current observation, after turning right, the agent would face east, and moving forward twice would get to the key's position. Then turn left and move forward.

But the immediate next action should be to turn right to align with the direction needed. So the first action would be 'turn right', then 'go forward' twice, then 'turn left', then 'go forward' twice. But the agent can only take one action at a time.

In the current observation, the agent needs to decide the next action. Given the walls, the best next step is to turn right to face east, then proceed forward. So the chosen action is 'turn right'.

The agent needs to reach the blue key. In the last observation, the blue key is 2 steps left and 2 steps forward from the current position. The walls are 3 steps forward and 3 steps right.

The agent previously turned right and left alternately, leading to situations where the key's position changed. Now, the key is two steps left and two steps forward. The agent needs to adjust direction to face towards the key.

If the agent is facing north, then ""left"" would be west. If the key is 2 steps left (west) and 2 steps forward (north), the agent should face north and then move forward. But the current observation shows walls 3 steps forward. Wait, the current observation says a wall 3 steps forward and a wall 3 steps right. So, if the agent is facing east, then forward would be east, but there's a wall there. Wait, no. Let me clarify the directions.

The agent's orientation isn't given, but in previous steps, turning left and right changed their direction. The key's position relative to the agent depends on the agent's current facing direction. Since the key is 2 steps left and 2 forward, the agent might need to turn left (west) and then move forward twice. But there's a wall 3 steps forward. Wait, the current observation says a wall 3 steps forward and 3 steps right. So, if the agent is facing north, forward would be north, but there's a wall 3 steps north. But the key is 2 steps left (west) and 2 steps forward (north). So, if the agent turns left (west), then the wall is 3 steps forward (west), but the key is 2 steps left (north from west)? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, maybe the agent should turn left to face west, then move forward twice towards the key. But the wall is 3 steps forward when facing north. Wait, perhaps the agent's current facing direction is east. Let's think: if the agent is facing east, then left would be north, right would be south. But the key is 2 steps left (north) and 2 steps forward (east). However, the wall is 3 steps forward (east), so moving forward isn't possible. So the agent can't go straight east. Therefore, the agent needs to turn north (left) and then move forward. But the key is 2 steps left and 2 steps forward. If the agent turns left (north), then forward is north. The key is 2 steps north (forward) and 2 steps west (left from north). Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe the agent should first adjust their direction to face north, then move forward to reach the key. But since moving forward directly north is blocked by a wall, that's not possible. So maybe the agent needs to go around the wall. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the agent needs to face west. If the agent turns left twice (west), then the key is 2 steps left (south) and 2 steps forward (west). No, that doesn't align. This is tricky. Let me re-examine the current observation:

Current Observation:
- Wall 3 steps forward
- Wall 3 steps right
- Blue key 2 steps left and 2 steps forward

Assuming the agent's current facing direction is north:

- Forward is north (wall 3 steps)
- Right would be east (wall 3 steps)
- Left is west

The key is 2 steps left (west) and 2 steps forward (north). So from the agent's perspective, to reach the key, they need to turn left (west) and then move forward twice. But if they turn left (west), then moving forward would be west. However, the wall is 3 steps forward when facing north, but if facing west, the wall's position isn't stated. Wait, the observation mentions walls in specific directions relative to the agent's current facing. So if the agent is facing north, the walls are 3 steps forward (north) and 3 steps right (east). The key is 2 steps left (west) and 2 steps forward (north). So, if the agent turns left (west), their new forward direction is west. The key is 2 steps left (which would be south from the agent's new position) and 2 steps forward (west). That doesn't make sense. Maybe the key is 2 steps west and 2 steps north from the agent's current position.

Alternatively, perhaps the agent needs to first turn right to face south. Then, forward would be south, but there's no wall mentioned in that direction. Wait, the observation only mentions walls in forward and right directions. If facing south, the wall directions would change. But the observation doesn't specify walls in other directions. So maybe the agent can't assume walls exist elsewhere. Therefore, the agent must navigate based on the given walls.

The key is 2 left and 2 forward. So, the agent needs to adjust their direction to face a direction where moving forward and left gets them to the key. If the agent is facing east, left is north, right is south. The key is 2 steps north and 2 steps east. But moving forward east is blocked by a wall. So the agent can't go east. If the agent turns left (north), then forward is north (blocked). If they turn right (south), forward is south (unknown walls). The key is 2 left (west) and 2 forward (north). So perhaps the agent needs to turn west (two left turns from east?), then move forward. But the observation says walls 3 steps forward and right when facing north. This is confusing without knowing the agent's current orientation.

Alternatively, maybe the agent should try to move forward despite the wall. But the observation says a wall is 3 steps forward, so moving forward would hit the wall. Therefore, the agent must find another path. Since the key is 2 steps left and 2 forward, perhaps the agent should first turn left to face west, then move forward until the wall is no longer in the way. But the current observation when facing north shows a wall 3 steps forward, which would be north. If the agent turns left (west), their forward direction is west, and there's no mention of a wall there. So maybe moving forward west is possible. Then, after moving west once, the key would be 1 step left (which would be south) and 1 step forward (west). But this is speculative. The agent needs to rely on the current observation. Since the observation doesn't mention walls in other directions beyond forward and right, perhaps the agent can proceed.

So the plan is: turn left to face west, then move forward twice to reach the key. But after turning left, the agent's forward direction is west, and the key is 2 steps left (south) and 2 steps forward (west). Wait, no. If the agent is facing west, left would be south, right would be north. The key is 2 steps left (south) and 2 steps forward (west). So from the agent's position facing west, moving forward twice would get them 2 steps west, which aligns with the key's position (assuming the key is 2 steps west and 2 steps south from the original position). This is getting too convoluted.

Perhaps the safest action is to turn left to face the direction where the key is possibly located, then move forward. Alternatively, since the key is 2 steps left and 2 forward, the agent could turn left (to face the direction where left is towards the key) and then move forward twice. But without knowing the exact orientation, it's challenging. 

Given the previous actions and the pattern of turning left and right to alternate positions, the agent might need to find a path around the walls. However, the key is getting closer each time. In the latest observation, the key is 2 steps left and 2 steps forward. The walls are 3 steps forward and 3 steps right. If the agent turns left (west), then their forward direction is west. The key is 2 steps left (south) and 2 steps forward (west). So moving forward twice would take them to the key's position. But since moving forward is possible (no wall mentioned in that direction when facing west), the agent can proceed.

Therefore, the best action is to turn left and then move forward. But the agent needs to execute these actions in sequence. The previous action was turn left, leading to the current observation. Now, after turning left, the agent should move forward twice. But in the current observation, after turning left, the forward direction is west, and the key is 2 steps left (south) and 2 steps forward (west). Wait, if the agent is facing west, left would be south, and moving forward twice would take them 2 steps west, which would align with the key's position (assuming the key is 2 steps west and 2 steps south from the original position). But the key's position is given as 2 left and 2 forward from the current position. If the agent is facing west, left is south, so moving left would be south, but the key is 2 steps left (south) and 2 steps forward (west). So the agent needs to move forward twice (west) to reach the key. But in that case, the key would be 2 steps west, which is directly forward. However, the key's position is described as 2 steps left and 2 steps forward. This suggests that after turning left, moving forward twice would reach the key. Therefore, the correct action now is to go forward.

25,Failed to obtain a valid action from the reasoning.,"<reasoning>
Let's see. My goal is to get to the blue key. I need to figure out the best action based on the current observation.

Looking at the observation: there's a wall 2 steps forward, a wall 3 steps to the right, and the blue key is 2 steps left and 1 step forward. 

Hmm, so the key is to the left and a bit forward. Right now, if I go forward, there's a wall blocking me. So moving forward isn't possible. The walls to my right and forward are in the way. 

I need to get to the key, which is left and a little forward. Since moving forward directly is blocked by a wall, maybe I should turn left or right to face a direction where the key is accessible. Let me think. 

If I turn left, then my direction would be to the left relative to my current facing. Then, moving forward might take me closer to the key. The key is 2 steps left and 1 forward. If I turn left, I can face a direction that allows me to go forward and left. Alternatively, turning right might not help because the key is to the left.

Wait, the key's position: if I'm currently facing a direction where moving forward hits a wall, then my current facing is perhaps north, and the wall is north. The key is 2 left (west) and 1 forward (north). But north is blocked. So I need to adjust my direction. Maybe I need to face a different direction to approach the key.

Alternatively, if I turn left (west), then moving forward would take me west, but the key is west and north. Wait, maybe the key's position is relative to my current direction. This is a bit confusing. Let me try to visualize.

Assuming my current direction is north, the walls are north (2 steps forward), right (east, 3 steps). The key is 2 steps left (west) and 3 steps forward (north)? Wait, the current observation says the blue key is 2 steps left and 1 step forward. So from my current position, if I face north, left would be west, and forward would be north. But the key is 2 west and 1 north. But there's a wall 2 steps forward (north), so going north directly is blocked. 

So I can't go forward. To reach the key which is west and north, I need to get past the wall. Maybe I should turn left (west) and move forward. Wait, but if I turn left (west), then moving forward would take me west, but the key is west and north. Hmm, perhaps I need to turn around? If I turn left twice, that's 180 degrees, facing south. Then moving forward would south, but the wall is north, so south might be clear. But the key is north, so that's not helpful. 

Alternatively, maybe I need to turn right. If I turn right (east), but there's a wall 3 steps east, so that's blocked. So turning right isn't useful. 

Wait, the key is 2 steps left and 1 forward. So if I turn left (west), then moving forward once would take me to 1 step forward (which is north), but the key is 2 steps left (west) and 1 forward (north). So if I turn left (west), then I need to go forward 1 step to get to the north direction, then left (west) again. But I can't move left directly, only forward. 

Alternatively, maybe I need to first adjust my direction. Let's think step by step. Current direction: let's assume I'm facing north. The wall is north (2 steps forward). The key is 2 west and 1 north. So the key is diagonally north-west from my current position. But the direct path is blocked by a wall. 

To get to the key, I need to either go around the wall or find a way through. Since the walls are 2 steps forward (north) and 3 steps east (right), perhaps I need to turn left (west) and move forward until I can go north. But if I turn left (west), moving forward would take me west, which might not lead to the key. 

Wait, the key is 2 steps left (west) and 1 step forward (north). So if I turn left (west) and move forward once, I'm now facing west, 1 step away from the original position. Then, the key is 2 steps west (from the new position) and 1 step north. But how do I get there? From the new position (after turning left and moving forward once), moving north would hit the original wall? Wait, no, the original wall is 2 steps forward (north) from the starting position. If I moved west once, the wall is still 2 steps north from the starting position, so from the new position, moving north would be 1 step towards the wall. That's not helpful. 

Alternatively, maybe I need to turn right. Wait, turning right would face me east, but there's a wall 3 steps east. So moving forward there is blocked. 

Hmm, maybe I need to go around the wall by moving in a different direction. Let me think differently. The key is located at a position that's northwest relative to my current location, but directly north is blocked. So perhaps I need to move west first, then north. But how?

If I turn left (west) and move forward as far as possible, but the observation after turning left shows that the wall is 3 steps forward. Wait, no, in the current observation, after a series of turns and movements, the walls and key positions change. Let me check the latest observation provided.

The latest observation from the user is:

Current Observation:
a wall 2 steps forward
a wall 3 steps right
a blue key 2 steps left and 1 step forward

So, in this state, the agent is facing a direction where moving forward 2 steps hits a wall. Moving right 3 steps hits a wall. The key is 2 steps to the left and 1 step forward.

So, assuming the agent is facing, say, north. Then, left is west, right is east. The wall is 2 steps north (forward), 3 steps east (right). The key is 2 steps west (left) and 1 step north (forward). 

But moving forward 1 step would still hit the wall in 1 step? Wait, the wall is 2 steps forward. So if the agent moves forward once, they are 1 step away from the wall. But the key is 1 step forward and 2 steps left. 

So, if the agent turns left (west), their forward direction is now west. Moving forward would take them west. But the key is west and north. So perhaps after turning left, moving forward once gets them to the west direction, then they need to turn north? But how? They can only turn left or right, not directly north. 

Alternatively, after turning left (west), the agent can move forward until they can then turn north. But how? Let's think step by step.

1. Turn left (now facing west).
2. Move forward until they can no longer do so (but in the current observation, the wall is 3 steps right, which would be south if facing west). Wait, if facing west, the walls would be in different directions. The original walls were forward (north), right (east). Now facing west, forward would be west, and right would be south. But the current observation mentions a wall 3 steps right. So if facing west, right is south, and there's a wall 3 steps south. 

Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe the agent's current direction is such that after turning left and right, the walls' positions relative to their facing change. 

Alternatively, perhaps the agent needs to first move towards the key's position by adjusting their direction. Since the key is 2 left and 1 forward, the agent needs to face a direction where moving forward and left gets them to the key. 

If the agent turns left (west), then moving forward 1 step would get them to the position that is 1 step forward (which is west) from the original, but the key is 2 steps west and 1 step north. So from that position, they would need to move north, but how? 

Alternatively, if the agent turns around (180 degrees), facing south. Then moving forward would take them south. But the key is north, so that's not helpful. 

Wait, perhaps the agent should first turn left to face west, then move forward until they can turn north. But how to turn north from west? They would need to turn left again (now facing north). Then move forward. 

But let's see. 

1. Turn left (west).
2. Move forward until there's a wall. According to the current observation, when facing west, the wall is 3 steps to the right (south). So moving forward west, there's no wall in front. Wait, the current observation says ""a wall 2 steps forward"" which, if facing west, forward is west. But in the current observation, the wall is 2 steps forward (west), and a wall 3 steps right (south). So facing west, moving forward 2 steps hits a wall. 

Wait, no. The current observation is under the latest state. Let me recheck:

Current Observation:
a wall 2 steps forward
a wall 3 steps right
a blue key 2 steps left and 1 step forward

Assuming the agent is facing north:

- Forward (north): wall 2 steps away.
- Right (east): wall 3 steps away.
- Blue key: 2 steps left (west) and 1 step forward (north).

So if the agent is facing north, to reach the key, they need to go west 2 and north 1. But north is blocked. So they need to find another path.

Possible actions:

- Turn left (west). Now facing west. Forward direction is west. The wall is 2 steps forward (west). So moving forward once would get them to 1 step from the wall. But the key is 2 steps west (from original position) and 1 step north. So from the new position (after moving west once), the key is 1 step west (which would be beyond the wall) and 1 step north. Wait, this is confusing. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent should turn left (west) and move forward 2 steps, which hits the wall. That's not helpful. 

Alternatively, the agent could turn right (east), but there's a wall 3 steps east, so moving right is blocked. 

Hmm, what other options are there? The agent is holding nothing, so they can't pick up the key yet. They need to reach it. 

Wait, the key is 2 steps left and 1 step forward. If the agent turns left (west), then their left direction is south. But the key is north of their current position. 

Alternatively, could the agent move left? No, the actions are only turn left, turn right, go forward, pick up, drop, toggle. There's no move left or right directly. 

So the agent must adjust their facing direction to approach the key. Since the key is northwest, perhaps the agent needs to face a direction that allows them to go northwest. 

If the agent turns left twice (180 degrees), facing south. Then moving forward would take them south, but the key is north. Not helpful. 

Alternatively, the agent could turn left (west) and then turn left again (south), but that's moving away from the key. 

Wait, maybe the agent should first move forward past the wall? But the wall is only 2 steps forward, so moving forward once gets them to 1 step from the wall. Then, they can turn left (west) and move forward to reach the key. Let's see:

1. Go forward once. Now the agent is 1 step away from the wall (north). The key is 2 steps left (west) and 1 step forward (north). So from this new position, the key is 1 step west and 0 steps forward (since the agent is already 1 step north). So the key would be 1 step west from here. 

2. Turn left (west). Now facing west. Move forward once to reach the key. 

So the sequence would be: go forward, turn left, go forward. 

But in the current observation, after the agent tried going forward earlier, maybe the walls have changed? Wait, the latest observation provided by the user is:

Current Observation:
a wall 2 steps forward
a wall 3 steps right
a blue key 2 steps left and 1 step forward

So the agent is still facing north, with a wall 2 steps north, 3 steps east, and the key is 2 west and 1 north. 

If the agent goes forward once, they would be at 1 step north, where there's still a wall 1 step ahead. So moving forward again would hit the wall. That's not good. 

So going forward once is not useful. 

Alternatively, the agent needs to turn left or right to find a direction where they can approach the key without hitting the wall. 

If the agent turns left (west), their forward direction is west. The key is west and north. So moving west would get them closer to the key's x-coordinate, but they still need to get north. 

But how? From west direction, moving north would require turning left again (now facing north), but that's not possible in one turn. 

Alternatively, after turning left (west), the agent could move forward until they can turn north. But how? 

Wait, maybe the agent should turn left (west), then move forward 2 steps (which hits the wall at 2 steps forward). That's not helpful. 

Alternatively, turn right (east), but there's a wall 3 steps east. 

Hmm. This is tricky. 

Wait, the key is 2 steps left and 1 step forward. From the current position, if the agent turns left (west), then their left direction is south. The key is north of their current position. 

Alternatively, the agent could toggle something, but there's no mention of a door or object to toggle in the observation. The only objects are the walls and the key. 

Wait, the agent needs to get to the key. The key is on the ground, so when the agent is in the same position as the key, they can pick it up. But to get there, they need to navigate around the walls. 

Given the current observation, the agent is facing north, with a wall 2 steps north, 3 steps east, and the key is 2 west and 1 north. 

The agent can't go north directly. So the only option is to move west, but west is blocked by a wall after 2 steps. Wait, no. If facing north, left is west. The wall is 2 steps forward (north), not west. So moving west isn't blocked. Wait, the wall mentioned in the current observation is 2 steps forward (north) and 3 steps right (east). So moving west isn't blocked. 

Ah, I see. So if the agent turns left (west), they can move forward as long as there's no wall. But according to the current observation, when facing west, the wall is 2 steps forward (west)? No, the wall in the current observation is still 2 steps forward from the agent's current position, which is north. So if the agent turns left (west), their forward direction is west, and the walls mentioned in the observation are in the original directions. 

Wait, this is confusing. The observation describes the walls relative to the agent's current facing. So if the agent is facing north, ""a wall 2 steps forward"" means 2 steps in the north direction. ""a wall 3 steps right"" means 3 steps east. The key is 2 steps left (west) and 1 step forward (north). 

So, if the agent wants to reach the key, which is northwest, they need to find a path that allows them to go west and north without hitting the wall. 

One possible path is:

1. Turn left (west). Now facing west. 
2. Move forward once. This takes them 1 step west. 
3. Turn left (south). Now facing south. 
4. Move forward until they can turn north. But this seems complicated. 

Alternatively:

1. Turn left (west).
2. Move forward until they hit the wall (2 steps forward). But that's not helpful. 

Alternatively, the agent could turn right (east), but there's a wall 3 steps east, so moving there is blocked. 

Hmm. Maybe the agent should first move forward past the wall? Wait, moving forward north would hit the wall in 2 steps. But moving forward once gets them to 1 step north, where there's still a wall 1 step ahead. So that's not useful. 

Wait, perhaps the agent should go around the wall by moving west and then south. Let's think:

Current position: facing north, key is northwest. 

1. Turn left (west).
2. Move forward 2 steps (but there's no wall mentioned in this direction in the current observation). Wait, the current observation only mentions walls in forward and right directions. If facing west, the wall in the current observation is 2 steps forward (which would be west) and 3 steps right (south). So moving forward west, there's a wall 2 steps away. 

So moving forward west once would be 1 step from the wall. Then, from there, the agent could turn left (south) and move forward, avoiding the wall. 

But the key is northwest, so this might not lead them directly. 

This is getting quite complex. Maybe the best action here is to try turning left to face west and then move forward towards the key. But given the wall is 2 steps forward when facing west, moving forward would hit the wall. 

Alternatively, the agent could turn left (west) and then turn left again (south), but that's moving away from the key. 

Wait, perhaps the agent should toggle an object, but there's no mention of any interactable object except the key. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to adjust their direction to face a different angle. For example, if they turn left twice (facing south), then move forward, but that's not helpful. 

Alternatively, the agent could drop something, but they aren't holding anything. 

At this point, considering the possible actions and the current observation, the most logical step is to turn left to face west, which would align the agent to move towards the key's westward component. Even though there's a wall 2 steps forward in that direction, maybe moving forward once gets them closer. 

But moving forward when facing west would be towards the key's x-coordinate but not the y. The key is also 1 step north, which is the original forward direction. 

Alternatively, after turning left (west), the agent could move forward once, then turn left again (south), and move forward to navigate around the wall. 

But this is","

Your previous output did not contain a valid action. Defaulted to action: go forward

Observation:
a wall 1 step forward
a wall 3 steps right
a blue key 2 steps left",0,False
26,turn left,"<reasoning>
The goal is to get to the blue key. I need to figure out the best path based on the current observation.

The observation says there's a wall 1 step forward, a wall 3 steps to the right, and the blue key is 2 steps left. So, if I'm facing forward (since the wall is 1 step ahead), the key is to the left. Let me visualize this.

If the key is 2 steps left, maybe I need to turn left to face the direction where the key is. But wait, the wall is 3 steps to the right. If I turn left, would there be a path forward towards the key? Alternatively, maybe I need to adjust my direction first. 

Wait, in the previous steps, the agent was turning left and right trying to align with the key. But in the last few observations, the key's position relative to the agent kept changing. Now, the key is directly 2 steps left. If I'm facing forward, turning left would make me face left, and then moving forward two steps would reach the key. But how do I know which direction the agent is currently facing? The problem is that the observations don't specify the agent's current orientation. 

Assuming the agent is facing a certain direction, maybe north, east, south, or west. But without that information, it's tricky. However, in previous steps, the agent was turning left and right to reposition. Now, the key is 2 steps left. If the agent turns left, they would face the direction where the key is located. Then they could go forward twice to reach it. Alternatively, they might need to pick up the key if it's under them, but the observation says the key is 2 steps left, so it's not directly below. 

Wait, the 'pick up' action is only possible if the object is below the agent. So unless the agent is directly above the key, they can't pick it up. Therefore, the agent needs to move towards the key's location. 

So, if the key is 2 steps left, the agent should turn left to face that direction and then go forward twice. But looking at the current observation, after turning left, moving forward might hit a wall if there's a wall 2 steps left? Wait, no. The observation states a wall 3 steps right and the key 2 steps left. So if the agent is facing forward, turning left would make the key 2 steps forward. Then they can go forward twice. So the steps would be: turn left, go forward twice. But the observation after turning left would need to confirm the key's position. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to make sure they are facing the correct direction. Let me check the last few observations. Previously, the agent turned left and right multiple times, but the key's position relative to forward changed. Now, the key is 2 steps left, which probably means if the agent turns left, the key is directly ahead. 

So the action should be 'turn left' to face the key's direction, then 'go forward' twice. But the agent can only take one action at a time. So first, turn left, then go forward. 

But the current observation after turning left would show the key 2 steps forward, so 'go forward' would pick it up once? Wait, no. The 'pick up' action is only when the key is directly below. So the agent needs to move directly onto the key's location. Therefore, after turning left, moving forward twice would position the agent above the key, allowing a 'pick up' action. 

But in the current observation, the key is 2 steps left. If the agent turns left, then the key is 2 steps forward. So moving forward once would get to 1 step left, then again to 2 steps left. Wait, maybe the directions are a bit confusing. Let me think again. 

Assuming the agent is facing north, the key is 2 steps to the west (left). So turning left (west) and then moving forward twice would reach the key. But in that case, the key would be directly under the agent after moving two steps west. Then 'pick up' would work. 

But according to the current observation, the key is 2 steps left. So if the agent turns left (west), then the key is 2 steps forward (west). So moving forward twice would land them on the key's spot, allowing pickup. 

So the correct action sequence would be: turn left, go forward (twice). But since the agent can only take one action at a time, the first step is to turn left. Then, after that observation, the agent can go forward. But in the current observation, before turning, the key is 2 steps left. So the immediate action should be to turn left. Then proceed. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent can go forward if possible, but the wall is 1 step forward, so they can't. So the next best action is to turn left to face the direction of the key and then move forward. 

Therefore, the appropriate action here is 'turn left' to align with the key's direction, followed by 'go forward' twice. But since the agent can only choose one action per turn, the first action is 'turn left'. Then, after that, the agent can go forward. 

Looking at the current observation, after turning left, the key would be 2 steps forward, so the next action would be 'go forward'. But in the current state, the agent needs to decide the next action based on the observation provided. 

The current observation says the key is 2 steps left. So the agent should turn left to face that direction. Then go forward. So the first action is 'turn left'. 

Alternatively, if the agent is already facing left, but the problem is that we don't know the agent's current orientation. However, based on the previous steps, the agent was turning left and right to try to align. For example, in the earlier observations, after turning left and right, the key's position relative to forward changed. Now, the key is 2 steps left, which suggests that turning left would face the key directly ahead. 

Therefore, the correct action is 'turn left' to face the key's direction, then 'go forward' twice. But since only one action is allowed now, the immediate action is 'turn left'.

27,go forward,"<reasoning>
The current observation says there's a wall 1 step to the right and a blue key 2 steps forward. I need to figure out the next move.

The goal is to pick up the blue key. The observations so far show that I've been navigating around walls, turning left and right to get into position. Now, after moving forward a few times and adjusting direction, the key is 2 steps ahead.

Looking at the latest observation, the key is directly 2 steps forward. Since the agent is facing the direction where the key is (since the key is 2 steps forward and there's a wall 1 step to the right), the next logical step is to move forward twice to reach the key. But wait, after moving forward once, the key would be 1 step forward. Then another forward would get it. But maybe there's a wall blocking the path? Let me check the current obstacles.

The wall is 1 step to the right, but the forward path seems clear since the key is there and there's no mention of a wall in front. So the agent should go forward once to get closer. Then, after that, another go forward. But according to the current observation, the key is 2 steps forward. So the immediate action should be to go forward. Once that's done, the next step would be to pick up the key. But the problem is, in the current observation, the key is still 2 steps away. So the correct action here is to move forward once. Once the agent is 1 step away, then the next move would be to go forward again to reach the key. After that, they can pick it up. But based solely on the current observation, the agent needs to go forward to decrease the distance to the key. So the answer should be go forward. Alternatively, if the agent is already facing the correct direction, going forward is the right move. Let me confirm the direction. The observations earlier had the agent turning left and right to adjust direction towards the key. Now, the key is directly 2 steps forward, so the agent is likely facing the correct direction. Therefore, the next action is to go forward. Then, repeat until the key is at 1 step, then pick it up. But for this specific observation where it's 2 steps forward, the correct action is go forward.
