0,turn left,"<reasoning>
Let me try to figure out what I should do here. The goal is to get to the green key after picking up the purple box. First, I need to understand the current environment based on the observation.

The observation says there's a wall 6 steps forward, so I can't go straight that way. To my right (2 steps), there's another wall. The green key is 1 step left and 4 steps forward, and the purple box is 1 step left and 3 steps forward. Hmm. So the box is one step closer to the key than I am. Since I need to pick up the box first, I should probably go to the box's location.

But how do I get there? Let's visualize. If the green key is left and forward from me, and the box is even more left and a bit forward, maybe I need to turn left to face the direction of the box. Wait, the current direction isn't specified, so I have to assume some starting direction. Maybe I'm facing north initially? Not sure, but the key is left and forward, so turning left might face me west, which is the left direction. Let me think.

Alternatively, the key is 1 left (west) and 4 forward. The box is 1 left (west) and 3 forward. So the box is directly in front of me if I'm facing west, but 3 steps away. Wait, but the observation mentions the box is 1 step left and 3 steps forward. So if I'm facing north, left would be west. So the box is to the west and 3 steps forward. So maybe I need to turn left (to face west) and then go forward three times. But there's a wall 6 steps forward, but if I'm facing west, then the walls mentioned (6 forward and 2 right) might be relative to my initial direction. Wait, the walls are described relative to my current position and direction. So the wall 6 steps forward is in the direction I'm currently facing. The wall 2 steps right would be to my right from my current direction.

So, if I'm facing north, the wall 6 steps forward is north, and the wall 2 steps right is east. The green key is west and 4 north, and the purple box is west and 3 north. So to get to the box, I need to turn left (west), then go forward 3 steps. But before that, maybe I need to check if there's anything in the way. The observation doesn't mention obstacles other than the walls. But the walls are 6 steps forward (north) and 2 right (east). So if I turn left (west), the path forward would be west. Are there walls in that direction? The observation doesn't specify, so maybe I can assume there are no walls unless stated. So I can proceed west.

So first action: turn left to face west. Then go forward three times to reach the purple box. Once there, use pick up to grab the box. Then, after that, need to go to the green key, which is one step further forward (since the box is at 3 steps west, the key is at 4 steps west). So after picking up the box, turn right to face north again (since facing west, turning right would face north), then go forward one step to the key. Then toggle to get it? Wait, does the key need to be toggled? Wait, the key is on the ground, right? So to pick it up, I just need to be in position and use 'pick up' when it's below me. Wait, the description says pick up the object below you. So if the key is on the ground, then when I'm in front of it, I can pick it up. Similarly for the box, which is an object I can pick up.

But in the current observation, the purple box is 1 step left and 3 steps forward. So after turning left (west), moving forward 3 steps would place me at the box's location. Then pick up the box. Then, from there, the green key is 4 steps forward (since the box is 3 steps away). So after picking up, I need to face north again (turn right from west), then go forward once to reach the key, then pick it up.

Wait, but the key is 1 step left and 4 steps forward from the starting position. So from the starting position, left is west, forward is north. So the key is 1 west and 4 north. The box is 1 west and 3 north. So the path is: start -> west 1 step (turn left), north 3 steps (go forward three times), pick up box. Then turn right (to face north again), go forward once to reach the key, then pick up the key.

But the initial observation says the box is 1 step left and 3 forward, so after turning left, moving forward three steps takes me there. Then pick up. Then turn right (now facing north), move forward once to get to the key's position, then pick up the key.

So the sequence would be: turn left, go forward three times, pick up, turn right, go forward once, pick up.

But the agent has to output one action at a time. So the first action is to turn left. Then after that, the next step would be go forward.

But the current observation lists the green key and purple box positions relative to the agent's current position and direction. Since the agent hasn't moved yet, the directions are based on where they are facing. Since the problem doesn't specify the initial direction, perhaps we can assume the agent is facing north. So left is west, right is east, forward is north.

So the first action should be to turn left to face west. Then go forward three times to reach the purple box. Then pick it up. Then turn right (to face north again), go forward once, then pick up the green key.

But the user's current observation is the first step. So the agent needs to choose the first action, which is to turn left. Then the next step would be go forward, etc.

So the first action should be turn left.

Let's see. The goal is to get the green key after picking up the purple box. The current observation after turning left shows a purple box 3 steps right and 1 step forward. So I need to reach that box first.

First, I need to figure out my current direction. The initial observation said the green key was 1 step left and 4 steps forward when facing a wall forward and a wall to the right. After turning left, the walls changed: now the wall is 5 steps forward and 1 step left. That means the agent is facing a new direction, probably north or another cardinal direction, but the exact direction might not matter as much as the relative positions.

The purple box is 3 steps to the right and 1 step forward. So from my current facing direction, right would be the direction where the wall is 1 step left (since after turning left, the original right is now the left relative to the new facing). Wait, maybe I need to visualize this better.

Original position after turning left: the wall is now 5 steps forward and 1 step left. The purple box is 3 steps right and 1 forward. So if I'm facing north, then right would be east. The box is 3 steps east and 1 step north. But since the wall is 1 step to the left (west), I might need to adjust. Wait, maybe the walls are in specific directions, so to approach the box, I need to go forward and then turn right.

Alternatively, the box is 3 steps right and 1 step forward. If I'm facing a direction where right is towards the box's location, then turning right would align me towards it. But I need to check the current observation again. After turning left, the box is 3 right and 1 forward. So if I'm facing north, turning right would face east. Then moving forward once would get me to the position where the box is 3 steps east. Then I need to go east three times? But maybe there's a wall blocking that path. Wait, the original observation after turning left mentions a wall 5 steps forward and 1 step left. So moving forward 5 steps would hit a wall, but moving right (east) 1 step would hit a wall as well? Wait, no. The current observation says a wall 1 step left. So from the current direction (after turning left), left is west. So if I turn right (now facing east), then moving forward 1 step would be east. But the box is 3 steps right (east) and 1 step forward (north). Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me break it down step by step.

Current state after turning left:

- Facing direction: Let's assume that after turning left, the agent is now facing north. Then:

  - Forward direction is north.
  - Right turn from north would be east.
  - Left turn from north would be west.

The walls in this state are:

- 5 steps forward (north): There's a wall 5 steps ahead.
- 1 step left (west): There's a wall directly to the west.

The purple box is 3 steps right (east) and 1 step forward (north). So from the agent's current position, moving east 3 steps and north 1 step would reach the box. However, moving forward (north) 1 step would take the agent to a position where the box is 3 steps to the east. But there's a wall 5 steps north, so moving north more than once would hit the wall. Wait, but the current wall is 5 steps forward (north), so if the agent moves forward once, that's 1 step north, then again forward, 2 steps, etc., until step 5 which is a wall.

So the agent needs to navigate to the purple box. Let's think about the path. The box is 3 east and 1 north. But moving north 1 step (forward) is possible because the wall is 5 steps forward, so moving 1 step north is okay. Then, from there, turn right (east) and move 3 steps. But wait, after moving forward once (north), the new position would have a wall 1 step left (west)? No, the walls are relative to the agent's current direction. So after moving forward once, the walls would still be in the same relative directions. Hmm, perhaps not. Wait, walls are in fixed positions in the game world, so the agent's direction affects how they perceive the walls. So when the agent turns left, their perception of direction changes, but the actual walls in the world remain in the same places.

This is getting complicated. Maybe a better approach is to figure out the sequence of actions needed to reach the purple box first.

The purple box is 1 step left and 3 steps forward from the initial position (after turning left). Wait, no. The initial observation after the first action (turn left) was:

Observation:
a wall 5 steps forward
a wall 1 step left
a purple box 3 steps right and 1 step forward

So in this state, the purple box is 3 steps to the right (east) and 1 step forward (north). The agent needs to move to that position. To get there, the agent can first move forward once (north), then turn right (east) and move 3 steps. But wait, after moving forward once, the new observation would change. Let's see:

After moving forward once (north), the agent's new position would have the wall 4 steps forward (since it was 5 steps before). The purple box would be 3 steps right (east) and 0 steps forward (since the agent is now 1 step closer). Then, the agent needs to turn right (east) to face that direction and move 3 steps. However, moving east 3 steps would reach the box. But before that, the agent needs to toggle the box to pick it up. But how to ensure there's no wall in the way.

Alternatively, maybe the agent should turn right first to face east, then move forward 3 steps. But the problem is that after turning right, the agent's forward direction is east. The initial observation after turning left showed a wall 1 step left (west). If the agent turns right (east), then their forward direction is east, and left is now north. There's no wall mentioned in the current observation in the east direction. Wait, the current walls are 5 steps forward (north) and 1 step left (west). So if the agent turns right (east), their forward direction is east, and left is north. There's no mention of a wall in the east or north direction except the ones already noted.

Wait, the current observation after turning left has:

- Wall 5 steps forward (north)
- Wall 1 step left (west)
- Purple box 3 right (east) and 1 forward (north)

So if the agent turns right (east), their forward direction is east. Then moving forward would go east. The purple box is 3 east and 1 north. So after turning right, moving forward once would be east 1, then again to 2, etc., but the box is 3 east and 1 north. Wait, perhaps the agent needs to first move forward once (north) to reduce the distance to the box, then turn right (east) and move 3 steps. That way, they reach the box's position.

So the steps could be:

1. go forward (now at position 1 step north)
2. turn right (now facing east)
3. go forward 3 times (reaching the purple box)
4. pick up the purple box

But need to check if there are any walls in between. After moving forward once (north), the wall is now 4 steps forward (north), so moving another step north would be okay. Then, turning right to face east, moving forward 3 steps. But is there a wall in the east direction? The current observation doesn't mention a wall in the east, only that there's a wall 5 steps forward (north) and 1 step left (west). So moving east should be possible. Thus, after turning right, moving forward three times would reach the box.

Alternatively, maybe the agent can go forward once, then turn right and move three times. Then pick up the box.

So the next action after the initial turn left would be to go forward. Let's see: the current observation shows the purple box is 3 right and 1 forward. If the agent moves forward once, the box becomes 3 right and 0 forward. Then turning right (east) and moving three steps would reach the box.

Yes, that makes sense. So the first action after turning left is to go forward once. Then turn right, go forward three times, then pick up.

But in the current observation after the first action (turn left), the purple box is 3 right and 1 forward. So moving forward once would make it 3 right and 0 forward, which is directly east. Then turning right and moving three steps would get to the box.

So the next action should be go forward. Let me check the current observation again:

Current Observation:
a wall 5 steps forward
a wall 1 step left
a purple box 3 steps right and 1 step forward

Yes, so the agent is facing a direction where forward is north (assuming after turning left). The wall is 5 steps north, and the box is 3 east and 1 north. So moving forward once (north) reduces the forward distance to the box to 0, and the right becomes 3 east. Then turn right (east) and move three steps to reach the box.

Therefore, the next action should be go forward.

I need to figure out the next move. The goal is to get the green key after picking up the purple box. Let me look at the current observation.

The agent is facing a situation where there's a wall 4 steps forward and a wall 1 step left. In front of them (since the wall is 4 steps forward), there's a purple box 3 steps to the right. Wait, how is the box positioned relative to the agent's current direction? Hmm. The previous observation had the purple box at 3 steps right and 1 step forward, but now it's 3 steps right. Maybe the agent moved forward once, reducing the distance. 

So the agent needs to pick up the purple box first. The box is to the right, but there's a wall 1 step left. The agent is facing a direction where moving forward hits a wall after 4 steps. To reach the purple box, which is 3 steps to the right, the agent should turn right first. Let me confirm: if the agent is facing north, then a wall to the left (west) and forward. The purple box is 3 steps east (right) from the agent's current position. So turning right would face the agent east. Then they can move forward towards the box. 

Wait, but in the previous step, when the agent moved forward, the purple box's position changed to 3 steps right. So moving forward once reduced the forward distance to the wall but adjusted the box's position. So after moving forward, the box is now 3 steps to the right. If the agent turns right (east), then moving forward towards the box would require moving east. But the observation shows the purple box is 3 steps right, which would be in the direction the agent turned. 

So the correct sequence would be: turn right to face the direction where the purple box is. Then go forward until the box is picked up. Once the box is picked up, the agent can navigate to the green key. But right now, the agent hasn't picked up the box yet. 

In the current observation, the agent is holding nothing, so the next step is to get to the purple box. Since the box is 3 steps to the right, turning right and then moving forward three times would reach it. But need to check if there's any obstacles. The wall is 4 steps forward in the original direction, but after turning right, the forward direction (now east) might have the box. However, the observation doesn't mention any walls in the new direction, so probably clear. 

So the first action should be to turn right. Then go forward. But the agent needs to pick up the box once it's in front. So after turning right and moving forward three times, they should be facing the box and then use pick up. But let me check the current observation again. The current observation says the purple box is 3 steps right. So turning right would align the agent to face the direction where the box is. Then moving forward once would make the box 2 steps away, but the agent needs to get to it. Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the direction again. 

Wait, when the agent turns right, their orientation changes. The original direction might have been north, so turning right would make them face east. The purple box is 3 steps right (east) from the agent's current position. So after turning right, moving forward three times would reach the box. But each move forward reduces the distance. So first, turn right, then go forward, then check if the box is picked up. 

But in the current observation, the purple box is 3 steps right. So after turning right, moving forward once would make it 2 steps right, then another forward to 1 step right, then once more to pick it up. Wait, but the 'pick up' action is used when the object is directly below the agent. So the agent needs to be on the same cell as the box. Therefore, once the agent is facing the box and moves forward until they are adjacent, they can pick it up. 

So the correct sequence is: turn right, then go forward three times to reach the box, then pick up. However, in the current observation, the box is 3 steps right. So after turning right, moving forward three times would place the agent at the box's location. Then pick up. 

But in the previous steps, the user's actions were turn left, then go forward. The observation after that showed the purple box 3 steps right and 1 step forward. Then in the current observation, after moving forward, the purple box is 3 steps right. So perhaps the agent is now one step closer to the wall but the box is directly to the right. 

Therefore, the next action should be to turn right to face the box. Then move forward until the box is picked up. But the current observation says the purple box is 3 steps right. So the agent needs to turn right and move forward three times. 

However, the agent can only take one action at a time. So the first action would be to turn right. Then in subsequent steps, go forward, etc. But the user is asking for the next action based on the current observation. So in the current observation, the purple box is 3 steps right. The agent hasn't picked it up yet. So the first necessary action is to turn right to face the direction of the box. Then, in the next step, move forward. But the user is asking for the next action now. 

Therefore, the correct action here is to turn right. That way, the agent faces the direction where the box is located, and then can proceed to move forward towards it.

3,go forward,"<reasoning>
Let's see where I am now. The current observation says there's a wall 3 steps to the right, a green key 4 steps forward, and a purple box 3 steps forward. So, from the previous steps, I must have picked up the purple box already because it's no longer in the observation. The key is still ahead, but I need to get there.

First, I need to check my current direction. In the previous interactions, the user's actions were: turn left, go forward, turn right, and now the current observation shows a purple box 3 steps forward. Wait, after turning right and moving forward, maybe I faced a direction where the purple box was in front. But after picking it up, the box is no longer there, so that must be done. Now, the green key is 4 steps forward. So I need to move forward four times? But maybe there's a wall in the way. The observation mentions a wall 3 steps right. 

So, if the wall is on the right, that might mean I'm facing a direction where right is blocked. The key is 4 steps forward, so I need to go straight. Let me think. The previous moves were: turn left (maybe to face a different direction), then go forward, turn right again. After that, the purple box was 3 steps forward. So perhaps after turning right, moving forward picked up the box. Now, in the current state, the green key is 4 steps forward. So the action should be to go forward four times? But each time I move forward, the observation might change. However, the tip says not to repeat the same action if the observation doesn't change. But in this case, since the key is 4 steps forward, and there's no wall in front (the wall is on the right), I can keep moving forward. Wait, the observation says a wall 3 steps forward. Wait, no—the current observation is ""a wall 3 steps right"" and ""green key 4 steps forward"". So the wall is on the right, but forward is clear except for the key being 4 steps ahead. So I can move forward four times. But maybe there's a way to optimize. Wait, the key is 4 steps forward. So the correct action is to go forward. But since the key is 4 steps away, do I need to move forward four times? However, the problem states that the agent must pick up the purple box first before going to the green key. But in the current observation, the purple box is already picked up (since it's not listed anymore). So the next step is to reach the green key. Therefore, the action should be to go forward. But the wall on the right doesn't affect moving forward. So the next action is to go forward once, which will get closer to the key. Then repeat that three more times. But according to the tips, I shouldn't repeat the same action if the observation doesn't change. So maybe in the next step, after moving forward once, the observation will update to show the key as 3 steps forward, then 2, etc. So the correct action here is to go forward once. That's the immediate next step.

Let's see. The goal is to get the green key after picking up the purple box.

Looking at the current observation: the purple box is 2 steps forward, the green key is 3 steps forward, and there's a wall 3 steps to the right. The agent needs to pick up the purple box first before going for the key.

In the previous steps, the agent turned left, went forward a couple times, turned right, and moved forward again. Now the purple box is 2 steps forward. So the next logical step is to move closer to it. The current position must have the agent facing the direction where the box is. So ""go forward"" would get the agent to the box's location. Once there, they can use ""pick up"" to get the box. Then, after picking it up, they can proceed towards the green key, which is now 3 steps forward. But first, they need to make sure they have the box before interacting with the key. So the immediate action should be to move forward two more steps to reach the purple box.

Let's see where I am right now. The current observation says there's a wall 3 steps to the right, the green key is 2 steps forward, and the purple box is 1 step forward. My goal is to pick up the purple box first and then go to the green key.

Looking at the previous steps, I think I've been moving forward towards the purple box. Let me check the history:

1. First, I turned left to face the direction the purple box and key are. Then, after moving forward a few times, the purple box was 3 steps right and 1 forward, so I turned right to align properly. Then moved forward again.

Now, the purple box is 1 step forward. Since the box is directly in front of me, the next logical step after positioning should be to pick it up. But wait, do I already have something in my inventory? The previous observations didn't mention holding anything. The problem states I need to pick up the purple box first, then go for the green key. So I should use the 'pick up' action here. 

Before that, I need to make sure the purple box is indeed in front of me. The observation says it's 1 step forward, so that's correct. So the next action should be 'pick up' to collect the purple box. Once I pick it up, then I can focus on moving forward to reach the green key, which is 2 steps ahead. But according to the tips, I shouldn't repeat the same action unnecessarily. So after picking up the box, the next step would be to go forward towards the key. But in this current observation, before picking up, I need to perform the 'pick up' action. Let me confirm: yes, the purple box is 1 step forward, so 'pick up' is the correct action here.

So, the goal is to pick up the purple box first and then go to the green key. I just picked up the purple box, so now I need to get to the green key. Let me check the current observation.

The observation says I'm carrying the purple box. There's a wall 3 steps to the right, and the green key is 2 steps forward. So the path to the key is straight ahead. I should move forward towards the key. Since the key is two steps forward, I need to take two go forward actions. But wait, after picking up the box, did anything else change? Let me make sure.

The user's previous action was pick up, which worked because the purple box is now in their inventory. Now, the green key is still 2 steps forward. So the next logical step is to go forward once to reach the key. But I need to check if there's any obstacle. The observation mentions a wall 3 steps to the right, but that's not in the direction of the key. So moving forward should be clear. 

I don't need to toggle anything here because the key isn't behind a toggle-able object, like a door. The key is just there, so once I'm in front of it, I can pick it up. But wait, the current observation lists the green key 2 steps forward. So I need to move forward once to get to the key's position. Then, I can pick it up. 

But wait, in the previous steps, after each go forward, the distance to the key decreased. Now it's 2 steps forward. So moving forward once will make it 1 step, then another go forward to reach it. But the user's current observation after picking up the box is that the green key is 2 steps forward. So the first move should be go forward. 

Let me confirm the sequence. User's last action was pick up, which succeeded. Now, the key is two steps forward. So the next step is go forward to get closer. Then, after that, another go forward, and then pick up the green key. But the user's current observation is after picking up the purple box, so the next action should be go forward towards the key. 

Alternatively, maybe the key is directly in front, so after moving forward once, it becomes 1 step, then another go forward. But the problem is to reach the key after picking up the box. Since the key is two steps away, I need to take two go forward actions. But the current observation's key is two steps forward, so the first go forward will make it one step. Then another go forward to reach it. 

However, in the current state, the observation lists the green key 2 steps forward, so the immediate next action should be go forward. Then, after that, another go forward, and then pick up. But the user wants the next action. Since the key is two steps away now, the next step is to go forward. So the correct action is go forward. 

Wait, but let me check if there's any other action needed. The purple box is already picked up, so the only thing left is to reach the green key. There's a wall to the right, but that's not relevant here. So moving forward is the right action. Thus, the answer should be go forward.
