Let's see. The agent needs to go to the purple key after picking up the green key. The current observation says there's a wall 4 steps forward and a wall 2 steps to the right. So, the agent can't go forward or right directly because there are walls there.

First, I need to figure out the agent's current orientation. The observation mentions walls in front (forward) and to the right. If there's a wall 4 steps forward and another 2 steps right, the agent must be facing a direction where moving forward hits a wall immediately, but turning right would also hit a wall 2 steps ahead. So maybe the agent is facing north, and there's a wall to the north, and to the east (right from north) there's a wall 2 steps.

But the goal is to pick up the green key first, then the purple key. The problem is, how does the agent know where the keys are located? The current observation doesn't mention any keys. So maybe the agent needs to explore the environment by turning around to find the keys.

Since the agent can't go forward or right, turning left might be an option. If the agent turns left, then perhaps they can go forward to find the green key. Alternatively, turning around 180 degrees (two right turns) might face them south, but if there's a wall 4 steps forward, that's still a problem. Wait, the walls are 4 steps forward in the original direction and 2 steps to the right. Let me visualize this.

Assuming the agent is facing north:

- Looking north (forward), there's a wall 4 steps ahead.
- Looking east (right), there's a wall 2 steps ahead.

So, the current position must be at a point where moving north into a wall, and moving east (right) 2 steps hits a wall. The agent is possibly in a corner or a corridor with walls in those directions.

Since the keys aren't mentioned in the observation, the agent needs to explore. The possible actions are turning left, right, going forward (which is blocked), picking up (nothing to pick up here), dropping (not holding anything), or toggle (no object in front).

So, the agent can't go forward. Turning left would face them west. If they turn left, then moving forward might be possible. But the observation doesn't say there's a wall in that direction. Wait, the original observation only mentions walls 4 steps forward (north) and 2 steps right (east). So, west (left direction) might be clear. Let me think.

If the agent is facing north, and turning left makes them face west. Then, going forward from there would be west. The observation doesn't mention walls in that direction, so maybe it's possible. Alternatively, maybe the agent should turn right twice (180 degrees) to face south, but then moving forward 4 steps would hit the wall again. So that's not helpful.

So the best action here might be to turn left to face west, then move forward to explore. But the problem is, the agent doesn't know where the keys are. However, the first step is just to choose an action based on the current observation. Since the agent can't move forward or right without hitting a wall, the next logical step is to turn left or right to change direction and then proceed.

Alternatively, maybe the agent should toggle something, but there's no object in front. The keys aren't present in the current observation, so the agent can't pick them up yet. Therefore, the possible actions are turn left, turn right, pick up (nothing), drop (nothing), or toggle (nothing). So the only valid actions are turning left or right.

Since the agent needs to explore to find the keys, turning left might lead to a new path. Turning right would face east again, but the observation says there's a wall 2 steps right (east), so moving forward there is blocked. Therefore, turning left seems better.

So the best action would be to turn left to face west, then eventually move forward once that direction is clear. For now, the agent should turn left.

The goal is to get the purple key after picking up the green key. So first, I need to pick up the green key. The current observation shows the green key is 2 steps left and 1 step forward. The purple key is closer, 1 step left and 3 steps forward. But I can't get the purple key until I have the green one.

Wait, the agent's current position and orientation aren't given. So I need to figure out the direction I should move based on the relative positions. Let me visualize. The green key is 2 left and 1 forward. The agent must be facing a certain direction. If the agent is facing north, then left would be west. But the initial observation after turning left had walls in different directions. Let me check the history.

In the first observation, the agent saw walls 4 steps forward and 2 steps right. Then they turned left. The next observation after turning left shows walls 5 forward, 3 left, green key 2 left and 1 forward. So when facing left (which was the direction after turning left from the initial position), the green key is to the left (which would be the new left direction?) and 1 forward. Hmm, maybe I need to map out the directions.

Alternatively, perhaps the agent is facing north initially. When they turn left, they face west. Then the green key is 2 steps west and 1 step north. The purple key is 1 step west and 3 steps north. Wait, but in the current observation, the purple key is 1 step left and 3 steps forward. If the agent is facing west (after turning left from north), then left would be south. So the green key is 2 steps west and 1 step north (forward), and the purple key is 1 step south and 3 steps north (which doesn't make sense because that would be moving north and south at the same time). Maybe I need to adjust my understanding.

Alternatively, maybe the directions are relative to the agent's current facing. So after turning left, the agent's forward direction is west. The green key is 2 steps left (which would be south?) and 1 step forward (west). Wait, that might not align. Let me try to parse the coordinates again.

The green key's position is given as 2 steps left and 1 step forward. If the agent is facing west, then left would be south, and forward is west. So from the agent's perspective, the green key is south-west? Or maybe the coordinates are relative to the agent's current orientation. For example, if the agent is facing north, then left is west, right is east. So ""2 steps left and 1 step forward"" would mean the green key is 2 steps to the west and 1 step north from the agent's current position.

Wait, that doesn't add up. If the agent is facing north, then forward is north. Left is west. So ""2 steps left and 1 step forward"" would place the green key 2 steps west and 1 step north relative to the agent's current position. But in that case, moving forward once would take the agent north, and then moving left (west) two steps would reach the green key. But the current observation also mentions the purple key is 1 step left and 3 steps forward. If the agent is facing north, then left is west, so 1 step west and 3 steps north. So the purple key is north-west of the agent, but closer horizontally.

But the agent's goal is to first pick up the green key. So how to get there. Let's break it down step by step.

The agent needs to navigate to the green key's location. The green key is 2 steps left and 1 step forward. Assuming the agent is currently facing north, left is west. So to get to the green key, the agent would need to move forward once, then turn left (west) twice? Wait, no. If the green key is 2 steps left and 1 step forward, perhaps the agent needs to move forward first, then turn left, and then move two steps left. Or maybe turn left first, then move two steps left and one forward. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the agent's current orientation is west after the initial turn left. Then, the green key is 2 steps left (which would be south) and 1 step forward (west). So from the agent's current position, facing west, the green key is south-west. To reach there, the agent would need to turn south (which would be turning right from west), then move two steps west and one step south? Wait, this is getting confusing without a clear map.

Alternatively, perhaps the agent should first move towards the green key. Since the green key is 2 steps left and 1 step forward, the agent can either turn left (to face the direction of the key) and move, or move forward first then turn. But given that there's a wall 5 steps forward and 3 steps left in the current observation, maybe moving forward isn't safe yet. Wait, the current observation after turning left shows walls 5 steps forward and 3 steps left. So if the agent is facing west (after turning left), moving forward 5 steps would hit a wall, and moving left (south) 3 steps would also hit a wall. The green key is 2 steps left (south) and 1 step forward (west). So from the agent's current position, facing west, moving forward 1 step would get to the green key's forward direction, but then need to move left (south) 2 steps. But moving left (south) is allowed? Or is there a wall?

Wait, in the current observation, the walls are 5 steps forward (west) and 3 steps left (south). So the agent can move forward (west) up to 5 steps, but moving left (south) up to 3 steps would hit a wall. However, the green key is 2 steps left (south) and 1 step forward (west). So from the agent's current position:

- Move forward 1 step (north? Wait, no. If facing west, forward is west. So moving forward 1 step takes the agent to the position west of where they were. Then moving left (south) 2 steps would take them 2 steps south from there. But the wall is 3 steps left (south) from the original position. So from the current position, moving forward 1 step (west), then left (south) 2 steps would be possible because the wall is 3 steps south from the original position, but after moving west once, the south direction would still have a wall at 3 steps from the original position, but the agent is now one step west. So the distance to the wall would be 3 - 1 = 2 steps? Wait, no. The wall is 3 steps left (south) from the original position. If the agent moves forward (west) once, their new position is 1 step west. The wall is still 3 steps south from the original position, which would now be 3 steps south from the agent's new position if they moved west. So the agent can move south 2 steps (to reach the green key) without hitting the wall. Because the wall is 3 steps south from the original position, but the agent is now 1 step west, so the wall is 3 steps south from there, which is 4 steps south-west? I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the walls are in fixed positions. The initial observation after turning left had a wall 5 steps forward (west) and 3 steps left (south). So the agent is facing west, and to their north there's nothing (no wall), but moving west 5 steps hits a wall, moving south 3 steps hits a wall. So the green key is 2 steps left (south) and 1 step forward (west). So from the agent's current position:

1. Move forward 1 step (west). Now the agent is 1 step west.
2. Then turn left (now facing south).
3. Move 2 steps south. The purple key is 1 step left (west) and 3 steps forward (north). Wait, after moving 2 steps south, the agent's position is 1 step west and 2 steps south. The purple key is 1 step left (west) and 3 steps forward (north). From this new position, to reach the purple key, the agent would need to move west 1 step (to 2 steps west and 2 steps south) and then north 3 steps. But from the current position (1 step west, 2 steps south), moving north 3 steps would take them to 1 step west, -1 steps south (north), which isn't possible. Hmm, this isn't making sense.

Maybe I need to approach this differently. The agent needs to pick up the green key first. The green key is 2 left and 1 forward. Let's see:

If the agent is facing west (after turning left), then left is south. So 2 steps left (south) and 1 step forward (west). So from current position, move forward 1 step (west), then turn left (south), then move 2 steps south. But moving 2 steps south would take the agent to the green key's location. Once there, the agent can pick it up.

But wait, after moving forward 1 step, the agent is at position (west 1). Then turning left (south) and moving 2 steps south would place them at west 1, south 2. Is that where the green key is? The green key's position is 2 steps left and 1 forward from the original position. So if original position is (0,0), then green key is at (-1, -2)? Or maybe coordinates are relative. This is getting too complicated without a grid.

Alternatively, perhaps the best approach is to first move towards the green key. Since the green key is 2 steps left and 1 forward, the agent can turn left (to face the direction of left and forward) and then move. But considering the walls, maybe the agent should move forward once, then turn left, then move two steps left. Let's see:

Current observation: green key is 2 left and 1 forward. Assuming the agent is facing west (after turning left), left would be south. So forward is west. So moving forward 1 step (west), then turning left (south), then moving 2 steps south. That should reach the green key. Then pick it up.

But before doing that, the agent needs to check if there are any obstacles. The current observation mentions walls 5 steps forward (west) and 3 steps left (south). So moving forward 1 step is safe. Then moving south 2 steps: since the wall is 3 steps left (south) from the original position, which is 3 steps south. After moving 1 step west, the agent is at west 1. The wall is at south 3 from original, which is south 3 from (0,0), so from (1,0), moving south 2 steps would be to (1,-2), which is within the 3 steps south from original (which is (0,-3)). So (1,-2) is 2 steps south from current position and 3 steps from original, so it's safe.

Once the agent reaches the green key's location, they can pick it up. Then they need to go to the purple key, which is 1 step left and 3 steps forward. Assuming the agent is now holding the green key, they need to navigate to the purple key's position.

But first, let's focus on getting the green key. So the steps would be:

1. Move forward once (to reach the position 1 step west).
2. Turn left (now facing south).
3. Move two steps south (to reach the green key's location).
4. Pick up the green key.
5. Then, navigate to the purple key's position (1 step left and 3 steps forward from the current position after picking up the green key).

But after picking up the green key, the agent's next goal is the purple key. The purple key is 1 step left and 3 steps forward from the agent's current position (which is now at the green key's location). So if the agent is facing south after picking up the green key, then left would be west, and forward is south. So 1 step left (west) and 3 steps forward (south) would take the agent to west 1 + 1 = west 2, and south 2 (current position after picking up) + 3 = south 5. But there's a wall 3 steps left (south) from the original position, which is at (0,-3). So from the agent's current position at (1,-2), moving west 1 step (to 2,-2) and then south 3 steps (to 2,-5). But the wall is at (0,-3), which is 3 steps south from original. The agent's path would go through (1,-3), (2,-3), etc. But since the original wall is at (0,-3), does that block any other areas? The problem says walls are in specific positions, so maybe the walls are fixed. The current observation mentions walls 5 steps forward (west) and 3 steps left (south) from the agent's current position. Wait, no—the current observation after the initial turn left says ""a wall 5 steps forward"" and ""a wall 3 steps left"". So from the agent's current position (after turning left), forward is west, left is south. So walls are 5 steps west and 3 steps south. So when the agent is at (0,0) facing west, moving west 5 steps hits a wall, moving south 3 steps hits a wall.

So from the agent's current position, after moving forward 1 step (to (1,0)), turning left (south), moving 2 steps south to (1,-2), then picking up the green key. Now the agent is at (1,-2) with the green key.

Next, to get to the purple key, which is 1 step left (west) and 3 steps forward (south) from here. So from (1,-2), moving west 1 step to (0,-2), then south 3 steps to (0,-5). But moving south 3 steps from (1,-2) would take the agent to (1,-5). Wait, the purple key's position is 1 step left and 3 steps forward from the agent's current position after picking up the green key. So if the agent is facing south (after picking up the green key), left is west, forward is south. So 1 step left (west) to (0,-2), then 3 steps forward (south) to (0,-5). But there's a wall 3 steps south from the original position (0,-3). So moving from (0,-2) south 3 steps would go through (0,-3), which is a wall. Therefore, the agent can't move past that wall. So this path is blocked.

Hmm, that's a problem. So the purple key is at a position that's behind the wall. Wait, the wall is 3 steps left (south) from the original position. So the wall is at (0,-3). The purple key is at (0,-5), which is beyond the wall. So the agent can't reach the purple key directly from this path. Therefore, the agent needs to find another route.

Alternative approach: After picking up the green key, the agent needs to reach the purple key. The purple key is 1 step left and 3 steps forward from the agent's current position (after picking up the green key). If the agent is facing south, then left is west and forward is south. So moving west 1 and south 3 would hit the wall at (0,-3) on the third step. Therefore, that path is blocked.

Alternative route: Maybe the agent should turn around. After picking up the green key, turn around (180 degrees) to face east, then move forward to find a path. But from the current position (1,-2), facing south, turning right twice would face east. Then moving forward would be east, which is allowed (no wall mentioned in that direction). But the purple key is west and south, so this might not help.

Wait, the purple key's position relative to the agent after picking up the green key is 1 step left (west) and 3 steps forward (south). If the agent faces east, left would be north. So moving left (north) 1 step and forward (east) 3 steps would take them to (1+3, -2+1) = (4, -1), which is not the purple key's position. So that's not right.

Alternatively, maybe the agent should reorient. After picking up the green key, turn left (now facing west), then move forward. But from (1,-2), facing west, moving forward would go to (0,-2), then ( -1, -2), etc., until a wall is hit at 5 steps west. But the purple key is at (0,-5), which is beyond the wall at (0,-3). So that's not possible.

This suggests that the agent cannot reach the purple key from the current position after picking up the green key, indicating a mistake in the path planning. Therefore, the initial approach to reach the green key might be flawed.

Alternative plan: Maybe the agent should approach the green key differently. Instead of moving forward 1 step and then south 2 steps, perhaps the agent should turn left first, then move.

Current observation: facing west, green key is 2 steps left (south) and 1 step forward (west). So if the agent turns left (south), then moves 2 steps south, then moves 1 step west. That would place them at the green key's location. Then pick it up.

So steps:

1. Turn left (already facing west, turning left would face south).
2. Move 2 steps south.
3. Move 1 step west.
4. Pick up green key.

But moving 2 steps south from current position (facing west) would take the agent to (1,-2). Then moving 1 step west to (0,-2). The green key is at (0,-2)? Or is the green key at 2 steps left and 1 forward from the original position? If original position is (0,0), then 2 steps left (south) and 1 forward (west) would be (-1, -2). Wait, this is confusing. Maybe the coordinates are relative to the agent's current position and facing.

Alternatively, perhaps ""2 steps left and 1 step forward"" means that from the agent's current position and facing, left is west and forward is north. Wait, no. The agent turned left initially, so facing west. Left from west is south, forward is west.

This is getting too tangled. Maybe I need to simplify.

The agent's current observation shows the green key is 2 steps left and 1 step forward. The agent is facing west. So left is south, forward","

Let's try to figure out what to do next. The goal is to pick up the green key first and then the purple key.

In the current observation, there's a green key 2 steps to the left. The purple key is 1 step left and 2 steps forward. There's also a wall 4 steps forward. 

First, I need to get to the green key. But how? The green key is 2 steps left. So the agent must be facing a direction where turning left would lead towards it. Wait, the previous actions might have changed the agent's orientation. Let's check the history.

The user's initial observation had a wall 4 steps forward and a wall 2 steps right. The agent turned left. Then the next observation showed a green key 2 steps left and 1 forward. But then the user's action led to a defaulted go forward. Now the current observation has the green key 2 steps left and the purple key 1 left and 2 forward. Also, there's a wall 4 forward again.

Wait, maybe the agent is facing north. If the green key is 2 steps left, that would be west. So the agent needs to turn west (left) to face that direction. But the agent's last action was go forward, which might have moved them forward, altering their direction? Or maybe the agent's direction hasn't changed because going forward when there's a wall would not move. Wait, the observation after go forward still has a wall 4 steps forward. That means the agent tried to go forward but hit the wall, so didn't move. So direction remains the same.

Assuming the agent is facing north initially. Let's retrace. First observation: walls forward and right. Agent turns left, which would face west. Then next observation: green key is 2 left (west) and 1 forward (south). So from facing west, the green key is 2 steps west and 1 step south. That would mean the agent is at position (0,0), green key at (-2,-1). But then after turning left, which is west, and trying to go forward, but there's a wall 5 steps forward. So maybe the agent is facing west, and the path west is blocked. Then the green key is 2 steps left (west) from where the agent is. Wait, maybe the agent is facing south? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused with directions.

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to adjust their direction to face where the green key is. Let's see. The green key is 2 steps left. If the agent turns left again (from the previous turn left), that would be facing south. But if the green key is to the left, maybe the agent needs to face west. Wait, the directions are relative to the agent's current facing. So each turn changes their facing. Let's say initial direction was north. Turn left (now west). Then the green key is 2 steps left (from west, left is south). Wait, that might not be right. If facing west, turning left would face south. So steps left from west would be south direction? This is getting complicated. Maybe I need to think in terms of current facing.

Alternatively, perhaps the agent needs to first turn to face the direction where the green key is. Since the green key is 2 steps left, the agent should turn left to face that direction. Let's check the previous actions. The agent turned left once, then tried to go forward but hit a wall. Now, in the current observation, green key is 2 steps left. If the agent is facing west (after turning left once), then left from west is south. So 2 steps left would be south. But the purple key is 1 step left and 2 forward from the current position. Wait, maybe the agent is facing north again. If the agent turned left once (to west), then went forward but hit a wall. So their position hasn't changed, but their facing is west. Now, green key is 2 steps left (west) from their current position. So to get to the green key, they need to go west 2 steps. But first, they need to make sure they are facing west. If they turned left once, they are already facing west. But when they tried to go forward, there was a wall. So maybe the wall is in front of them (west), but the green key is 2 steps left from their current position. Wait, perhaps the green key is not directly in front but in a different direction. This is confusing without a map.

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to first turn around. If the green key is 2 steps left, perhaps turning right twice (to face east) and then moving? No, that might not be right. Alternatively, after turning left once (facing west), the agent can't go forward because of a wall. So they need to turn another direction. If they turn right (now facing north again), then the green key is 2 steps left (west) from their current position. But how to get there? If they can't go forward west because of a wall, maybe they need to adjust their direction. Wait, perhaps the agent needs to turn right (south) to face a different direction. Let me think again.

Alternatively, the agent should first pick up the green key. To do that, they need to be in the same cell as the green key. Since the green key is 2 steps left, the agent needs to move left (turn left and go forward twice). But if there's a wall 4 steps forward (when facing west), then moving forward from west would hit the wall. So maybe the agent can't go west directly. Therefore, they need to find another path. Maybe they need to turn around. Turn right twice to face east, then check the surroundings. But without knowing the map, it's hard. 

Wait, the current observation says the green key is 2 steps left. If the agent turns left (west), then the green key is 2 steps forward. But there's a wall 4 steps forward in that direction. So that's not possible. Therefore, the agent must be facing a different direction. Maybe after the previous turn left, they tried to go forward but hit the wall, so they are facing west with a wall ahead. Then the green key is 2 steps left (south) from their current position. But how to get there? They would need to turn south (another left turn), then move. But if there's no wall in that direction, they can go. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent should turn right (now facing north again), then move forward until they can turn left towards the green key. But without knowing the layout, it's tricky. 

Wait, the tips say to toggle the object when you're in front of it. The green key is below the agent, so when they are on the same cell, they can pick it up. So the agent needs to move to the cell where the green key is. Since it's 2 steps left, perhaps the agent needs to turn left (west) and then go forward twice. But if there's a wall 4 steps forward when facing west, that would mean that moving forward from west is not possible. So maybe the agent is facing north initially, turned left to west, then tried to go forward but hit a wall. Now, to get to the green key, which is 2 steps left (west) and 1 step forward (south from the wall?), the agent needs to turn around. Maybe turn right (south), then go forward until they can turn left towards the green key. 

Alternatively, the agent could turn right (south), move forward until there's no wall, then turn left (west) and move towards the green key. But this is all guesswork. 

Given the current observation, the green key is 2 steps left. The agent needs to face that direction and move. If they are facing west, they can try to go forward, but there's a wall 4 steps forward. So maybe the green key is not directly in front but in a different direction. Wait, maybe the green key is 2 steps to the left and 1 step forward from the agent's current position. But the observation says ""2 steps left and 1 step forward"". So that would mean from the agent's current position, turning left (west) and then moving 1 step forward (south) and 2 steps left (west) would get to the green key. Wait, that doesn't make sense. The coordinates are relative. So ""2 steps left and 1 step forward"" would be from the agent's current position, left is west, forward is north. So 2 steps left (west) and 1 step forward (north) would place the green key at (-2, 1). But if the agent is facing west, then left is south, so maybe the coordinates are different. This is getting too complicated without a map.

Perhaps the best approach is to first pick up the green key. To do that, the agent needs to be in the same cell. The green key is 2 steps left. So the agent should turn left (to face the direction of the green key) and then move forward twice. But if moving forward is blocked by a wall, they need to adjust. Alternatively, if the green key is 2 steps left and 1 step forward, the agent might need to turn left, move forward once, then turn left again and move forward twice. But this requires knowing the exact layout.

Alternatively, the agent can try to toggle the green key, but that only works if they are directly in front of it. Since the green key is below the agent when they are on the same cell, the agent needs to move there. So the correct actions would be: turn left to face the direction of the green key, then go forward until they reach it, then pick up. But if there's a wall in the way, they need to navigate around.

In the current observation, after the previous go forward (which hit a wall), the agent is facing west, and the green key is 2 steps left (west) and 1 step forward (north from the wall). Wait, maybe the agent is facing north again. If they turned left once (west), then tried to go forward but hit a wall, their facing is west, and the green key is 2 steps left (west) and 1 step forward (north from their current position). So from west facing, left is south. So moving left (south) 1 step and forward (west) 2 steps would reach the green key. But how?

This is getting too confusing. Let's try a different approach. The agent's goal is to get the green key first. The current observation shows the green key is 2 steps left. So the agent needs to turn to face that direction. Assuming the agent is facing north, turning left would face west. Then moving forward twice would reach the green key. But if there's a wall 4 steps forward when facing west, that means moving forward from west is blocked. Therefore, the green key must not be directly in front. So perhaps the agent needs to turn right (now facing south), move forward until there's no wall, then turn left (west) and move towards the green key. 

But in the current observation, after the previous go forward (which hit a wall), the agent is facing west, and the green key is 2 steps left (west) and 1 step forward (north). So from the agent's position, if they turn right (south), move forward until they can go west. But without knowing the map, it's hard. 

Alternatively, the agent can try to turn right twice (to face east), then move forward until they can turn north or something. But this is all guesswork. 

The safest action given the current observation is to turn left again to face the direction of the green key and try to move forward. If there's a wall, then they need to adjust. But the observation says the green key is 2 steps left, so maybe they can move forward after turning left. However, in the current observation, when facing west (after previous turn left), there's a wall 4 steps forward. So moving forward wouldn't work. Therefore, the agent needs to turn another direction. 

Perhaps the agent should turn right (now facing north again), then move forward until they can turn left towards the green key. But how many steps? The green key is 2 steps left, which would be west. If the agent turns right (north), moves forward until they can turn left (west) and then move 2 steps. But if moving north hits a wall, that's not good. 

Alternatively, the agent can try to pick up the green key by moving left twice and forward once. But they need to navigate around the wall. Maybe turn right (south), move forward until there's no wall, then turn left (west) and move towards the green key. 

Wait, the current observation has a wall 4 steps forward when facing west. So the agent is facing west, and 4 steps ahead is a wall. The green key is 2 steps left (west) and 1 step forward (north from the agent's current position). So from the agent's position (assuming facing west), left is south. So to get to the green key, they need to move south 1 step and west 2 steps. But they can't move west because there's a wall 4 steps ahead. Therefore, they need to turn around. Turn right twice (now facing east), then move forward until they can turn north or west. 

But this is getting too complicated. Given the constraints, the best action might be to try to move towards the green key by turning left and moving forward, but since there's a wall, perhaps the agent needs to turn around. 

Alternatively, since the green key is below the agent when they are in the same cell, maybe the agent can try to toggle or pick up, but they need to be there. So the correct sequence is: turn to face the green key's location, move there, then pick up. 

Given the current observation, the agent should first turn left to face the direction of the green key (2 steps left). But if turning left makes them face west, and there's a wall 4 steps forward, they can't move. So they need to adjust. Turn right (now facing north), then move forward until they can turn left (west) and move towards the green key. 

But how many steps to move north? If moving north isn't blocked, they can go forward, then turn left and move west. But the observation doesn't mention walls in other directions. 

Alternatively, the agent can try to turn left, then move forward once, but there's a wall. So they can't. Therefore, the agent needs to turn right (south), move forward until no wall, then turn left (west) and move. 

Since the agent's latest observation has the green key 2 steps left and purple key 1 left and 2 forward, maybe the agent should first get the green key. So the next action should be to turn left to face the green key's direction and move forward. But since moving forward is blocked, the agent needs to adjust. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent should turn right (south), move forward once, then turn left (west), and move forward twice. But without knowing if there's a wall, this is risky. 

Given the uncertainty, the safest action might be to turn left again and attempt to move forward, but since that's blocked, the agent needs to try a different direction. Turn right (south), then move forward. If there's no wall, proceed. 

Wait, the current observation after the defaulted go forward says walls 4 steps forward (west), 3 steps left (south). The green key is 2 steps left (west) and 1 forward (north). The purple key is 1 left (west) and 2 forward (north). 

So the agent is facing west, with a wall 4 steps ahead. The green key is 2 steps west (which is the same direction as forward but blocked). Wait, no. If the agent is facing west, then ""2 steps left"" would be south. So the green key is 2 steps south and 1 step west from the agent's current position. 

This is getting too complex. Maybe the agent should try to pick up the green key by moving in that direction. But since moving west is blocked, they need to go around. 

Alternatively, the agent can turn around (turn right twice to face east), then move forward until they can turn north or west. But again, without knowing the map, it's hard. 

Given the time constraints, the best action is probably to turn left and move forward, but since that's blocked, turn right and move forward. Let's try that.

3,turn left,"<reasoning>
The current observation has a wall 4 steps forward and a wall 3 steps to the right. The last action was ""turn right"", which probably oriented the agent in a direction where the green key was previously located. However, after turning right, the agent faced a new set of walls.

The agent's goal is to first pick up the green key and then go to the purple key. The problem now is that with the new observation showing walls in both forward and right directions, the agent is likely facing a dead end. The previous attempt to go forward after turning right didn't work because there's still a wall blocking the path. 

Since moving forward isn't possible and turning right again would hit the wall, the next logical step is to turn left. This would change the agent's direction, possibly opening up a path to the green key. The agent needs to navigate around the walls to reach the green key. Turning left might allow moving forward again towards the green key's location mentioned in previous observations. 

The agent must avoid repeating the same ineffective actions. Since turning right led to a wall, turning left could explore a new direction. After turning left, the agent might be able to move forward without hitting a wall, progressing towards the green key. Once the green key is picked up, the agent can then navigate to the purple key, but first, the immediate action is to change direction to avoid the wall and proceed towards the green key's location.

 <sep> human:","a wall 4 steps forward
a green key 2 steps left
a purple key 1 step left and 2 steps forward",0,False
4,turn left,"<reasoning>
Let me try to figure out the next step here. The goal is to get the purple key after picking up the green key. Let's look at the current observation.

The green key is 2 steps left. The purple key is 1 step left and 2 steps forward. There's a wall 4 steps forward and a wall 3 steps right. So, I need to navigate to the green key first.

Wait, where am I facing right now? The previous observations showed that after turning right, there was a wall 3 steps right and after turning left, walls in front. But the current observation doesn't mention direction. Maybe I need to infer my direction based on past actions.

Looking back: The user's first observation had walls forward and right. Then, the agent turned left. Next observation had green and purple keys in specific positions. After that, when the agent tried to go forward, defaulted to go forward. Then turned right, and now walls again.

Assuming after turning right, the agent is facing a different direction. The green key is 2 steps left. To get there, perhaps I need to face left and move. But if I'm facing right, moving left might not be straightforward. Maybe I need to adjust my direction first.

Wait, the current observation lists the green key 2 steps left and purple key 1 left and 2 forward. The walls are still in front and to the right. So maybe the agent is facing north, with walls to the north and east. The green key is to the west (2 steps left), and the purple key is northwest (1 left, 2 forward).

To reach the green key, I need to go west. But if there's a wall 3 steps to the right, which was east, then moving left (west) would be possible. But how to get there.

Wait, but the agent's current direction isn't clear. The previous steps: started with walls forward and right. Turned left (so now facing east?), then green key was 2 steps left (west?), purple key 1 left and 3 forward. Then after some actions, turned right (now facing south?), leading to walls in front and right. Then turned left again (north?), back to original direction? This is getting confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the agent is facing north. Let's assume that. Then walls to the north (4 steps forward) and east (3 steps right). The green key is 2 steps left (west), and purple key 1 left (west) and 2 forward (north). So, the purple key is north-west relative to the green key.

But the agent hasn't picked up the green key yet. So the priority is to get the green key first. To reach the green key, which is 2 steps left (west), the agent needs to face west. Currently, walls are in front (north) and right (east). So facing north, turning left would face west, which is the direction of the green key.

So, the action should be turn left to face west, then go forward twice to get the green key. But the agent might need to pick it up. Once picked up, then navigate to the purple key.

But in the current observation, after turning left, the agent is facing west. Then go forward twice, pick up the green key. Then turn around (maybe turn right twice to face north), and then go forward 2 steps to reach the purple key's position (1 step left and 2 forward from there? Wait, no. After picking up the green key, the purple key is 1 step left and 2 forward from the green key's location.

Alternatively, maybe after getting the green key, the agent needs to navigate to the purple key's location. But the purple key is 1 step left and 2 forward from the current position. Wait, the current observation says the purple key is 1 step left and 2 steps forward. So if the agent is facing west (after turning left), then left would be south, and forward would be west. That doesn't align. Maybe I need to adjust directions.

This is getting a bit tangled. Let me recap:

Current Observation:
- Wall 4 steps forward (assuming north)
- Wall 3 steps right (east)
- Green key 2 steps left (west)
- Purple key 1 step left (west) and 2 steps forward (north)

Agent's goal: pick up green key first, then purple key.

Current direction: If after turning left from the initial direction (say north), facing west. Then green key is directly west 2 steps. So action would be go forward twice, pick up. Then, to get to the purple key which is 1 step west and 2 steps north, the agent would need to turn north (turn right twice from west?), go forward 2 steps, then left (now facing west) 1 step. But that seems complicated.

Alternatively, after picking up green key, the agent is at the green key's position. The purple key is 1 step left (west) and 2 steps forward (north) from there. So from the green key's location, facing north, go forward 2 steps to reach the purple key's position, then left (west) 1 step. But how does that align with the current observation?

Wait, the current observation lists the purple key as 1 step left and 2 steps forward from the agent's current position. So if the agent is facing north, left is west, forward is north. So the purple key is west 1 and north 2. That would mean it's 2 steps north and 1 step west from the agent's current position.

But the green key is 2 steps west. So from the agent's current position, west 2 to get to green key. Then, from there, north 2 and west 1. But the agent needs to pick up the green key first.

So the steps would be:

1. Turn left (to face west)
2. Go forward twice (to green key)
3. Pick up green key
4. Turn right twice (to face north)
5. Go forward 2 steps
6. Turn left (to face west)
7. Go forward 1 step
8. Pick up purple key

But in the current observation, after the agent turned left once, the walls are still in front and right. So maybe the agent is facing west now, green key 2 steps forward. So the next action should be go forward twice, then pick up.

But the problem is that the agent can only perform one action at a time. So in the current step, the agent needs to decide the next action based on the current observation.

Current Observation:
- Green key 2 steps left (west)
- Purple key 1 left and 2 forward (west 1, north 2)
- Walls forward (north 4) and right (east 3)

Assuming the agent is facing north (since walls are north and east), turning left would face west. Then go forward twice to reach green key. So the next action should be 'turn left' to face west, then 'go forward' twice, then 'pick up'. But the agent can only do one action per turn.

Wait, in the current step, the agent's previous action was 'turn left', leading to the observation of walls 4 forward and 3 right. Wait, no. Let me check the history.

Looking back: After the first observation, the agent turned left. Then the next observation showed green key 2 steps left and purple key 1 left and 3 forward. Then the agent tried to go forward, but it failed, defaulted to go forward. Then the observation after that was walls 4 forward, green key 2 left, purple key 1 left and 2 forward. Then the agent turned right, leading to walls 4 forward and 3 right. Then turned left again, walls 4 forward and 3 right. Now the current observation is the same as one before: walls 4 forward, green key 2 left, purple key 1 left and 2 forward.

So perhaps the agent is in a loop, turning left and right without progress. The key here is that the agent needs to face the correct direction to reach the green key.

In the current observation, the green key is 2 steps left. So if the agent turns left (west), then go forward twice. But if the agent is facing north, turning left would face west. Then go forward twice to get to the green key. Then pick up. Then turn around (turn right twice to face north again), go forward 2 steps (since purple key is 2 steps forward from there), then left (west) 1 step, then pick up.

But the agent needs to execute this step by step. The current step is after turning left and right a few times, ending up back at the same position. So the agent needs to first turn left to face west, then go forward.

But the current observation shows the green key is 2 steps left. So if the agent turns left (west), then go forward twice. So the next action should be 'turn left' to face west, then 'go forward'.

Wait, but in the current observation, after turning left, the walls are 4 forward and 3 right. So if the agent turns left again, would that face west? Let me think. If the agent was facing north, then turning left once faces west. Turning left again would face south. But in the observation after turning left once, the walls are 4 forward (which would be south if facing west) and 3 right (east). That doesn't align. Wait, maybe the initial direction is different.

This is getting too confusing without knowing the agent's current facing direction. Maybe the best approach is to look at the relative positions.

The green key is 2 steps left, and the purple key is 1 step left and 2 forward. So if the agent turns left (assuming that left is west), then the green key is 2 steps forward. So the next action should be 'turn left' to face west, then 'go forward' twice, then 'pick up'. But the agent can only do one action at a time. So first, 'turn left', then 'go forward' twice, then 'pick up'.

But in the current observation, the agent is facing a wall 4 steps forward and a wall 3 steps right. If turning left would face a wall? Wait, in the current observation, after turning left, the walls are 4 forward and 3 right. Wait, no. Let me check the history again.

The user's last observation before the current one was:

Observation:
a wall 4 steps forward
a green key 2 steps left
a purple key 1 step left and 2 steps forward

Then the assistant's previous response was 'turn right', leading to the next observation of walls 4 forward and 3 right. Then the assistant turned left again, leading to the same walls. Now the current observation is back to the same as before: walls 4 forward, green key 2 left, purple key 1 left and 2 forward.

This suggests that turning left and right isn't helping. The agent might be facing a direction where turning left or right doesn't change the forward wall. So perhaps the agent needs to go forward despite the wall? But the observation says a wall 4 steps forward. So moving forward isn't possible.

Wait, the initial observation had a wall 4 steps forward and a wall 2 steps right. The agent turned left, leading to a new observation where green key is 2 steps left and purple key 1 left and 3 forward. Then the agent tried to go forward, but it failed (defaulted to go forward). Then the observation updated to purple key 1 left and 2 forward. Then the agent turned right, leading to walls 4 forward and 3 right. Then turned left again, back to original walls. Now it's stuck.

So maybe the agent needs to first face the direction of the green key. Since the green key is 2 steps left, the agent needs to turn left (west) to face it. Then go forward twice. But how to confirm the direction.

Alternatively, the agent could try to toggle or interact with objects, but there's nothing to toggle except the keys when they're picked up. So the priority is to get the green key.

Given that the agent is repeatedly turning left and right without progress, perhaps the correct action is to 'turn left' to face west (green key direction) and then 'go forward' twice. But since the agent can only do one action at a time, the next step is to turn left if not already facing west.

But in the current observation, after turning left and right, the agent is back to the same starting point. So maybe the agent is facing north, walls to the north and east. Green key is west, 2 steps. So 'turn left' to face west, then 'go forward' twice. Then pick up.

So the next action should be 'turn left' to face west. But in the previous steps, turning left led to different observations. Wait, in the first turn left, the walls were different. So maybe the agent's initial direction was north. Turning left faces west, then green key is 2 steps forward. But in the current observation, after turning left, the walls are 4 forward and 3 right. That doesn't make sense. Unless the agent is now facing south.

This is really tricky without knowing the facing direction. Maybe the best approach is to assume that the agent needs to face the direction of the green key. Since the green key is 2 steps left, the agent should turn left until facing that direction. Then move forward.

In the current observation, the green key is 2 steps left. So if the agent turns left once (assuming that left is west), then go forward twice. So the next action is 'turn left' to face west. Then 'go forward' twice. Then 'pick up'.

But the agent can only perform one action per turn. So the immediate next action is 'turn left' to face west. Then in subsequent steps, 'go forward' twice and 'pick up'.

Given that the previous attempts to go forward resulted in failure (because of walls?), but in the current observation, there's no wall mentioned in the direction of the green key. Wait, the current observation says wall 4 steps forward, which would be the direction the agent is currently facing. So if the agent is facing north, there's a wall 4 steps north. But the green key is 2 steps west. So the agent needs to turn left (west) to face the green key, then go forward twice.

So the correct action now is 'turn left' to face west, so that the green key is 2 steps forward. Then 'go forward' twice, then 'pick up'. Since the agent can only do one action at a time, the next action is 'turn left'.

5,go forward,"<reasoning>
Let's see. The current observation is a wall 3 steps left, a green key 2 steps forward, and a purple key 2 steps right and 1 step forward.

The goal is to pick up the purple key after getting the green key. Right now, I need to make sure I first get the green key. Let me check my current direction. From the previous actions, like turning left and right, maybe I'm facing a certain direction now.

In the latest observation, the green key is 2 steps forward. So if I'm facing the direction where forward is towards the green key, I should go forward twice to reach it. But wait, there's a wall 3 steps left. Does that affect anything? Maybe I need to check my current orientation.

Alternatively, if I need to pick up the green key first, then I should move towards it. Since the green key is 2 steps forward, using ""go forward"" twice should get me there. Once there, I can use ""toggle"" to pick it up. Then, after picking up the green key, I need to navigate to the purple key, which is 2 steps right and 1 step forward. But before that, I need to make sure I'm facing the correct direction. If I'm facing north after getting the green key, moving right would be east. So I might need to turn right once to face east, then go forward twice and one step forward? Wait, the purple key is 2 steps right and 1 step forward. So if I'm facing east after getting the green key, moving right (which would be south?) Hmm, maybe I need to adjust my direction.

Alternatively, after picking up the green key, I need to navigate to the purple key's location. Let's think step by step. First, pick up the green key. So the sequence would be: go forward twice to reach the green key, toggle to pick it up. Then, from there, turn right to face the correct direction, then move forward 2 steps and 1 step. But the observation shows the purple key is 2 steps right and 1 step forward from the current position. Wait, the current observation's purple key position is relative to where the agent is now. So after picking up the green key, the agent is where the green key was, which is 2 steps forward from the previous position. Then, from there, the purple key is 2 steps right and 1 step forward. So I need to figure out the direction the agent is facing.

If the agent was moving forward to get the green key, then after picking it up, they would be facing the same direction. So if the purple key is 2 steps right and 1 forward, that might mean they need to turn right (to face east, assuming they were facing north before), then go forward 1 step, then turn right again to face south, and go forward 2 steps? Or maybe another combination. But this might get complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the agent should first go forward to the green key, pick it up, then turn right, go forward once, turn right again, and go forward two steps to reach the purple key.

But before any of that, the current observation shows the green key is 2 steps forward. So the immediate next action should be to move forward once to get closer. Wait, but moving forward twice would reach the green key. However, maybe there's a wall in the way that I need to check. Wait, in the current observation, there's a wall 3 steps left and the green key is 2 steps forward. So there's no wall blocking the path to the green key. So the agent can go forward twice, toggle to pick up the green key. Then, after that, navigate to the purple key's location.

Alternatively, maybe the agent is facing a direction where ""forward"" is towards the green key. So the correct action now is to go forward once to move closer. But since the green key is 2 steps away, maybe the agent should go forward once, then again, then toggle. But to avoid repeating the same action (go forward) multiple times, the agent should go forward twice in one go if possible. Wait, but the actions are step by step. So the agent needs to do go forward once, then again, then toggle.

But in the current observation, after moving forward twice, the agent would be at the green key's location. Then toggle to pick it up. Then, the agent needs to navigate to the purple key. The purple key is 2 steps right and 1 step forward from the current position (after picking up the green key). So the agent's next steps would involve turning right, moving forward 1 step, then turning right again, moving forward 2 steps. But this depends on the agent's current direction.

Alternatively, maybe the agent should first turn right to face the correct direction. For example, if the agent is facing north, and the green key is to the north, then after picking it up, turning right would face east. Then moving forward 1 step (as per the purple key's position: 1 step forward from the green key's location). Then, turn right again to face south, and move forward 2 steps. But this might be a bit convoluted.

But given the current observation, the immediate action should be to move towards the green key. So first, go forward once. Then again. Then toggle. But the problem is that the agent needs to pick up the green key first before the purple key. So the correct sequence is: go forward twice, toggle to pick up green key, then navigate to purple key.

However, in the current step, the agent hasn't picked up the green key yet. So the next action should be to move forward once to get closer. But the agent can't move forward twice in a single action. So the first step is to go forward once. Then again. Then toggle.

But looking at the previous interactions, the user's previous actions included turning left and right to reorient. So maybe the agent's current direction is such that ""forward"" is not towards the green key. Wait, the current observation has the green key 2 steps forward and a wall 3 steps left. So if the agent is facing a direction where forward is clear (no wall), then moving forward is possible. The wall is 3 steps left, which means if the agent turns left, there's a wall 3 steps ahead. But the green key is 2 steps forward, which is in the forward direction. So the agent should be facing a direction where forward is clear towards the green key.

Therefore, the immediate next action should be to go forward once to move closer to the green key. Repeating the same action (go forward) until reaching the green key. But the tip says not to repeat the same action if the observation doesn't change. So after moving forward once, the observation would change (the green key would be 1 step forward), so it's okay to go forward again. Then toggle once the green key is 1 step forward.

So the sequence would be:

1. go forward (green key now 1 step forward)
2. go forward (green key at 0 steps forward, i.e., agent is on top of it)
3. toggle (picks up green key)
4. then navigate to purple key.

But in the current observation, the green key is 2 steps forward. So the first action should be to go forward once. Then, after the next observation, the green key would be 1 step forward, allowing the agent to go forward again, then toggle.

However, the user's previous actions included turning left and right to adjust direction, which might have changed the agent's facing. But based on the current observation, the agent can move forward towards the green key without hitting a wall. So the best action now is to go forward once.

6,pick up,"<reasoning>
The goal is to pick up the purple key after getting the green key. Let's look at the current observation.

The green key is 1 step forward. So right in front of me. The purple key is 2 steps to the right. The latest observation also mentioned a wall 3 steps left and a wall 4 steps forward previously, but now the wall to the left is 3 steps away. 

So I need to get the green key first. Right now, the green key is 1 step forward. To pick it up, I need to be directly above it. If I go forward once, that should bring me next to the green key. Then I can use the 'pick up' action. After that, I need to navigate to the purple key which is 2 steps to the right. But after picking up the green key, I should have it in my inventory, and maybe the path changes? Let me check the current obstacles again. 

There's a wall 3 steps left, so turning left might not be helpful unless I need to avoid a wall. The wall 4 steps forward was mentioned earlier, but in the current observation, maybe that's not the case anymore. Wait, the current observation says a wall 3 steps left and the green key is 1 step forward. So after moving forward to get the green key, I can pick it up, then turn right to head towards the purple key which is 2 steps right and 1 step forward. Wait, no, in the current observation, the purple key is 2 steps right. So once I have the green key, I need to go right twice. But before that, I need to make sure I can move right without hitting a wall. 

Looking at the walls: 3 steps left. If I'm facing the direction where the green key is, after picking it up, turning right would face me towards where the purple key is. Then moving right twice would get me there. But I need to check if there are walls in the way. The current observation doesn't mention walls to the right, so maybe it's clear. 

So the steps should be: go forward to get to the green key's position, pick it up, then turn right, then go forward twice to reach the purple key. But since the purple key is 2 steps right, perhaps after turning right, moving forward twice. Alternatively, after picking up the green key, turn right and move forward. Wait, the current observation's purple key is 2 steps right. So if I'm facing the direction where the green key was (since I moved forward once to get it), then turning right would face me east, assuming the initial direction was north. Then moving right (east) two steps would get me to the purple key. 

So the immediate action needed is to go forward to reach the green key. Once there, pick it up. Then proceed to the right. So the first step is to 'go forward' to get to the green key's location. Then 'pick up' the green key. Then turn right, then go forward twice. But since the current observation is after picking up the green key (from previous steps?), wait no. Let me check the latest user observation. 

The current observation is: a wall 3 steps left, green key 1 step forward, purple key 2 steps right. So the agent hasn't picked up the green key yet. Because if they had, the green key wouldn't be in the observation. So the agent is facing a direction where 1 step forward is the green key, and 2 steps to the right is the purple key. There's a wall 3 steps left. 

So the correct action here is to move forward to get to the green key. Once there, pick it up. Then turn right to face the direction of the purple key, which is 2 steps to the right. Then go forward twice. But since the current observation still shows the green key, the agent hasn't picked it up yet. Therefore, the immediate action should be 'go forward' to reach the green key's position. Then 'pick up'. But since the user is asking for the next action based on the current observation, which includes the green key 1 step forward, the correct action is to move forward. Then after that, pick up. But the user's current observation is the state after possibly previous steps. Wait, looking at the conversation history, the last user observation before this was:

Observation:
a wall 3 steps left
a green key 2 steps forward
a purple key 2 steps right and 1 step forward

Then the assistant's last action was 'go forward', leading to the next observation where the green key is 1 step forward. Then the current observation has green key 1 step forward. So the agent has moved forward once to get closer. Now, the next step is to pick up the green key. But the current observation still lists the green key, so the agent hasn't picked it up yet. Therefore, the correct action now is 'pick up'. 

Wait, the agent's inventory isn't mentioned in the observations, so the system must track that internally. But according to the problem statement, the agent needs to first pick up the green key, then the purple. So in the current observation, the green key is 1 step forward. So the agent needs to 'pick up' it. 

Therefore, the correct action is 'pick up' because the green key is directly in front, and once picked up, the agent can proceed to the purple key.

The goal is to get the purple key after picking up the green one. I already have the green key, so now I need to focus on getting the purple key.

Looking at the current observation: I'm carrying the green key. The purple key is 2 steps to the right. There's a wall 2 steps forward and 3 steps left, so I can't go backwards or left easily. 

The purple key is in front of me to the right. To reach it, I need to face the right direction. Since my current orientation isn't specified, but in the previous steps, the assistant turned left a couple of times. Let me check the history. Previously, the agent turned left, then went forward, picked up the green key, and now needs to move towards the purple key.

Assuming after picking up the green key, the agent might have turned left again to face the direction where the purple key is. But the current observation shows the purple key is 2 steps right. So maybe I need to turn right to face the correct direction. Once facing right, moving forward twice would get to the purple key. Then pick it up.

But wait, the observation mentions the purple key is 2 steps right. So if I'm facing the right direction, going forward once would get me next to it. Or maybe I need to adjust my direction. Let me think: in the previous step, after picking up the green key, the observation had the purple key 2 steps right. The agent's previous action was ""pick up"", which succeeded. Now, the agent needs to navigate to the purple key.

Since there's a wall 2 steps forward, moving forward isn't possible directly. The purple key is to the right, so turning right would allow moving forward towards it. So the next action should be ""turn right"" to face the direction of the purple key. Then, after turning right, move forward twice to reach it and pick it up.

But the current observation shows the purple key is 2 steps right. So after turning right, moving forward once would get to the key. Then pick up. So the immediate action should be ""turn right"" to face the correct direction. Then in the next step, go forward and pick up.

But the agent has to choose exactly one action now. So the correct action here is to turn right to face the purple key's location. Then, in the next step, go forward and pick it up. So the first action needed is to turn right.

Let me see. I need to get to the purple key after picking up the green key. I already have the green key, right? So now the goal is to reach the purple key.

Looking at the current observation: I'm carrying the green key. There's a wall 2 steps left and the purple key is 2 steps forward. So my options are to go forward, turn left, turn right, toggle, drop, or pick up. Since I need the purple key, how do I get there?

If I go forward two steps, I should reach the purple key. But wait, is there anything blocking the path? The observation mentions a wall 2 steps left, but it doesn't say anything about obstacles in front. So moving forward should be safe. Let me double-check. The purple key is directly 2 steps forward. So the best action here is to go forward to pick it up. alternatively, maybe I need to check if there's a door or something I need to toggle, but the observation doesn't mention anything in front besides the key. 

So the next step is to move towards the purple key. The correct action is to go forward. That should get me to the key. Let me confirm again. The key is 2 steps forward, wall is to the left. No other keys to pick up. So yes, go forward.
