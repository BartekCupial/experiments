Let's see. I need to pick up the yellow ball first, then go to the green key. Right now, the observation says there's a wall 5 steps forward, a wall 1 step left, and a yellow ball 3 steps right and 1 step forward.

Hmm, the first thing is to get to the yellow ball. But how? The directions mention the ball is 3 steps right and 1 step forward. So I need to adjust my current direction to face the right path. Since there's a wall to the left (1 step left), maybe I'm facing north, and the ball is to the east (right) and north (forward). 

Wait, if I'm facing north, then turning right would face me east. Then I need to go 3 steps east and 1 step north. But there's a wall 5 steps forward, which might be in the direction I'm initially facing (north). So maybe I can't go straight north. Let me map this out.

Alternatively, maybe I should first turn right to face east. If I turn right once, then I can go forward 3 steps to reach the ball's east direction. But wait, the ball is also 1 step forward from that position. So after going east 3 steps, I need to go north 1 step. But the wall is 5 steps forward, which would be in the original direction (north). So if I'm facing east, going forward would be east direction, which might not have a wall. But the observation only mentions walls in the forward direction (5 steps) and left (1 step). So maybe when facing east, there's no wall in front. 

So the plan: turn right to face east. Then move forward 3 steps to get to the ball's east position. Then turn left (so now facing north) and move forward 1 step to reach the ball. Then pick it up. But wait, the ball is directly in front? Let me check the observation again. The ball is 3 steps right and 1 step forward. If I'm facing east after turning right, then moving forward 3 steps would be east, then turning north (left turn) and moving 1 step forward would place me at the ball's location. Then pick up. 

So the sequence would be: turn right, go forward 3, turn left, go forward 1, pick up. But before that, I need to check if there are any obstacles. The only walls mentioned are 5 steps forward (original direction, which is north if I'm facing east now?) Wait, when I turn right to face east, the forward direction becomes east. The original forward was north. The wall 5 steps forward (north) would still be there if I try to go north, but when facing east, moving forward would be east, which the observation doesn't mention a wall. So moving east 3 steps should be possible. Then turning left (now facing north), moving 1 step. But the wall is 5 steps in the original forward (north) direction, so moving 1 step north shouldn't hit a wall. 

So the first action should be to turn right to face east. Then go forward 3 steps. Then turn left (now facing north), go forward 1 step. Then pick up. 

But the problem is the agents have to output one action at a time. The initial observation is that the yellow ball is 3 steps right and 1 step forward. So the agent's current position is facing a direction where right is east and forward is north. Let me clarify the directions. 

If the agent is facing north initially, then to the right (east) is 3 steps, and forward (north) is 1 step. But the wall is 5 steps forward (north). So to reach the ball, the agent needs to go east 3 and then north 1. But since moving north 5 steps is blocked, but only 1 step is needed. So the path is possible. 

Therefore, the first action should be to turn right to face east. Then go forward 3 steps. Then turn left (to face north) and go forward 1 step. Then pick up. 

But since the agent can only take one action at a time, the first action is to turn right. That way, the next actions can proceed towards the ball. 

So the correct first action here is to turn right. Then the next steps will follow. But according to the current observation, the ball is 3 steps right and 1 forward. So turning right aligns the agent to face the east direction, which is where the ball is 3 steps away. Then moving forward three times, then turning left (north) and moving once. Then pick up. 

So the immediate action to take is to turn right. That's the first step to reorient towards the ball.

Let's see. My goal is to pick up the yellow ball and then go to the green key. The current observation shows the yellow ball is 1 step left and 3 steps forward. The agent's current direction isn't specified, so I need to figure out based on previous actions.

In the previous step, the user's action was ""turn right"". So after turning right, the agent's new direction is to the right relative to their original direction. Now, the yellow ball is 1 step left and 3 forward. If the agent is facing right, then ""left"" would be the opposite direction, which is left from their current facing. Wait, directions can be a bit confusing here. Let's break it down.

Assuming after turning right, the agent is facing north. Then, left would be west. But the observation says the yellow ball is 1 step left and 3 steps forward. If facing north, left is west, so the ball is west and north. But the agent needs to get there. Alternatively, maybe the agent is facing east after turning right. Then left would be north. Wait, the initial position isn't given, so maybe I should focus on relative directions.

Alternatively, perhaps the agent needs to adjust their direction to face towards the yellow ball. The current observation has the ball 1 step left and 3 forward. To move towards it, the agent might need to turn left or right. Let's think: if the agent is facing a certain direction, moving left or right would change their facing, allowing them to go forward towards the ball.

In the previous step, turning right made the agent face a new direction. Now, the ball is 1 left and 3 forward. If the agent turns left again, they might be facing a direction that allows them to go forward and left towards the ball. Alternatively, if they turn right again, maybe that's not the direction. Let me visualize.

Suppose after turning right, the agent is facing east. Then ""left"" would be north. The ball is 1 step left (north) and 3 steps forward (east). So to reach the ball, the agent needs to go north and then east? Or maybe first turn north (by turning left from facing east) and then go forward 3 steps, but there's a wall 6 steps forward now. Wait, the current observation mentions a wall 6 steps forward. So if the agent is facing east, moving forward 3 steps would hit a wall. That's a problem.

Wait, the current observation after turning right: walls are 6 steps forward and 2 steps right. So if facing east, forward is blocked after 6 steps. The yellow ball is 1 left (north) and 3 forward (east). But moving forward 3 steps would hit the wall. So that's not possible. Therefore, the agent needs to adjust direction to avoid the wall.

Hmm. So maybe the agent should turn left from their current facing (east) to face north. Then, moving left (west) 1 step and forward 3 steps. But wait, in the current observation, the yellow ball is 1 left and 3 forward. If facing north, left would be west. So moving west 1 step and north 3 steps? But the agent's position relative to the ball isn't clear. Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to first turn left to face north, then move forward to reach the ball.

But the problem is the wall is 6 steps forward. If facing north, can the agent move forward 3 steps without hitting the wall? The observation doesn't mention a wall in the north direction, only that forward (from the current facing, which is east) has a wall. So if the agent turns left to face north, moving forward 3 steps would be possible, as there's no wall mentioned in that direction. Then, after moving forward 3 steps, they can check if the ball is still 1 step left (west) and adjust.

Alternatively, maybe the agent should first move left (north) 1 step, then go forward 3 steps. But how does that align with the directions? Let me try to map this out.

Current direction after turning right: let's assume east. Ball is 1 left (north) and 3 forward (east). But moving east 3 steps hits a wall. So that's impossible. Therefore, the agent can't go directly east. So they need to turn north (left from east) and then move forward 3 steps, then go west 1 step? Wait, but the ball is 1 step left (north) from the current position. If the agent turns left to face north, then moves forward 3 steps, they would be 3 steps north. Then, the ball is 1 step left (west) from that position. So they would need to move west 1 step. But moving west from facing north would be left, so toggle? No, maybe pick up.

Wait, but the ball's position is relative. So after turning left (now facing north), moving forward 3 steps would place the agent 3 steps north. Then, the ball is 1 step left (west) and 0 steps forward. So moving west 1 step would reach the ball. Then pick it up.

But the problem is, how does the agent know the wall is only 6 steps forward in the original direction. So when facing north, moving forward 3 steps is safe. Then west 1 step. That seems possible.

So the actions needed would be:

1. Turn left (to face north)
2. Go forward 3 times (but the agent can't move 3 steps in one action; each 'go forward' is one step. But the observation says the ball is 3 steps forward after turning right. Wait, initial observation after turning right had the ball 1 left and 3 forward. So after turning right, the agent's forward direction is east, left is north. The ball is north 1 and east 3. But moving east 3 steps would hit a wall. So instead, turn left to face north, move forward 3 steps (east is still forward?), no, wait if facing north, forward is north. Wait, directions can be confusing.

Wait, perhaps the agent's orientation is changing with each turn. Let me clarify:

- Original direction: let's say the agent starts facing north.

- First action: turn right → now facing east.

- Current observation: yellow ball is 1 step left (west) and 3 steps forward (east). But moving east 3 steps would hit a wall (6 steps forward in current direction). So can't go that way.

So to reach the ball, need to adjust direction. If facing east, turning left would face north. Then, moving forward (north) 3 steps, then moving left (west) 1 step would reach the ball.

So actions:

1. Turn left (now facing north)
2. Go forward 3 times (each 'go forward' is one step)
3. Then turn left (now facing west)
4. Go forward 1 step
5. Pick up

But the agent needs to do this in the current step. However, in the current observation, the yellow ball is 1 step left and 3 steps forward. So after turning left (to face north), the forward direction is north. The ball is 1 step left (west) and 0 steps forward (since moving north 3 steps would get to that position). Wait, no. If the agent is facing north, then moving forward 3 steps would be 3 steps north. The ball is 1 step left (west) from the agent's current position. Wait, the ball's position is relative to the agent's current position and direction.

This is getting a bit complicated. Maybe the agent should first turn left to face north, then move forward once, check the observation, and adjust. But since the user expects the agent to choose the next action based on the current observation, let's think step by step.

Current Observation:
- Wall 6 steps forward (from the agent's current facing direction, which is east after turning right)
- Wall 2 steps right (from current facing, which is east, so right would be south)
- Yellow ball 1 step left and 3 steps forward (left from east is north, forward is east)

The agent needs to get to the yellow ball. Since moving east 3 steps is blocked by a wall, the agent must adjust direction. The best option is to turn left to face north, then move forward 3 steps (since there's no wall mentioned in the north direction), then turn left again to face west, and move 1 step to get the ball.

But the agent can only perform one action per turn. So in the current step, what's the best action?

After turning right, the agent is facing east. The ball is north 1 and east 3. To move towards the ball without hitting the wall, the agent should turn left (to face north) and then move forward. Each 'go forward' action moves one step. So first action should be to turn left to face north, then go forward. But in the current observation, the ball is 3 steps forward in the original direction (east), but after turning left, forward is north. So perhaps the agent should first turn left to face north, then go forward 3 times. However, since the agent can only take one action at a time, the first step is to turn left to face north, then in the next step go forward.

But the user is asking for the next action based on the current observation. So the current observation after turning right has the yellow ball at 1 left and 3 forward. The agent is facing east, with a wall 6 steps forward (east), 2 steps right (south). The yellow ball is north 1 and east 3. Since moving east is blocked, the agent must turn left to face north, allowing them to move forward towards the ball.

So the next action should be to turn left. Then, in subsequent steps, go forward three times, then turn left again to face west, move one step, and pick up. But the user's current observation is after the previous turn right, so the agent needs to decide the next action. The immediate next step is to turn left to face north, allowing movement towards the ball without hitting the wall.

2,go forward,"<reasoning>
The agent needs to pick up the yellow ball first, then go to the green key. The current observation shows that there's a wall 5 steps forward, a wall 1 step left, and the yellow ball is 3 steps right and 1 step forward.

The previous actions were turning right and then left, but according to the latest observation, the ball is back to being 3 steps right and 1 forward. Maybe the agent's previous turns adjusted their direction. Wait, the user provided two observations: the first after turning right, then the second after turning left. Now, the current observation is the same as the first one. That might mean the agent is back to the starting position. 

So, the agent is facing a direction where forward is blocked by a wall. The yellow ball is 3 steps to the right and 1 forward. To reach it, the agent needs to turn right to face the correct direction, then move forward and right appropriately. But in the current observation, turning right would lead to where the wall is? Wait, in the first observation after turning right, the wall was 6 steps forward. Hmm, maybe the agent's direction changes affect how they perceive the walls. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent is facing north initially. The first observation has a wall 5 steps forward (north), a wall 1 step left (west), and the ball 3 steps right (east) and 1 forward (north). If the agent turns right (east), then the forward direction would be east. But in the next observation, after turning right, the wall is 6 steps forward (east), and the ball is 1 step left (west) and 3 steps forward (east). So perhaps the agent is now facing east. Then turning left would make them face north again. But the current observation is back to the first one, meaning perhaps they turned around. 

Wait, maybe the agent needs to navigate around the walls to get to the ball. Let's think step by step. The current observation is the same as the first one: walls forward and left, ball to the right and forward. So the agent is facing a direction where forward is blocked, left is also blocked. The ball is 3 steps to the right (which would be their right side if they're facing north, so east) and 1 step forward (north). 

So, to reach the ball, they need to turn right (east), then move forward until they can align with the ball. But in the first observation, after turning right, the wall was 6 steps forward. If they go forward 6 steps, they hit a wall. But the ball is 3 steps right and 1 step forward from the original position. So perhaps the agent needs to first turn right, move forward 1 step (since the ball is 1 step forward from there), then turn right again to face south? Wait, maybe not. Let me visualize.

Original position: Facing north. Walls north (5 steps), west (1 step). Ball is east 3, north 1. So to reach the ball, the agent needs to go east 3 steps and north 1, but the wall is directly north 5 steps. So they can't go straight north. Therefore, they need to go east first, then north. So turn right (east), move forward until they can go north. But in the first observation, after turning right, the wall is 6 steps forward (east), which blocks that path. Wait, that's confusing. Maybe the walls are in different positions based on direction. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent's current direction is such that turning right makes the forward direction east, but there's a wall 6 steps east. The ball is 1 step left (west) and 3 steps forward (east) from the agent's current position after turning right. So if the agent is facing east, the ball is 3 steps east and 1 step west? No, that doesn't make sense. Maybe the coordinates are relative. 

This is getting a bit confusing. Let me try another approach. The agent's goal is to pick up the yellow ball first. The current observation has the ball at 3 steps right and 1 forward. So the agent needs to adjust their direction to face towards the ball and then move. 

If the agent is currently facing a direction where right is east and forward is north, then the ball is 3 east and 1 north. To reach it, the agent should turn right (east), move forward until they can go north. But if turning right (east) and moving forward hits a wall (as per the first observation after turning right, there's a wall 6 steps forward east), then they can't go that way. Hmm, maybe the agent needs to go around the wall. 

Wait, in the first observation, after turning right, the wall is 6 steps forward. So if the agent turns right (east), they can't go east because there's a wall. The ball is 3 east and 1 north. So maybe the agent needs to go north first, but there's a wall 5 steps north. So they can't go north directly. Therefore, they need to go east, then north, but the wall is in the way. Maybe the ball is positioned such that the agent has to go around the wall. 

Alternatively, perhaps the agent needs to turn left instead. If the agent turns left (west), then the forward direction is west, but there's a wall 1 step left (west), so that's blocked. That's not helpful. 

Wait, the current observation is the same as the first one. The agent tried turning right and left, but ended up back where they started. Maybe they need to go forward somehow. But the wall is 5 steps forward. Unless... the agent is not blocked when moving forward one step at a time. Wait, the actions are ""go forward"" which is one step. So even if there's a wall 5 steps away, maybe moving one step at a time is possible until the wall is reached. 

But in the current observation, the wall is 5 steps forward. So if the agent moves forward once, they are 4 steps from the wall. But where is the ball? The ball is 3 steps right and 1 step forward. If the agent is facing north, right is east. So to get to the ball, which is east 3 and north 1, the agent needs to go east first, then north. But moving east is blocked by a wall 6 steps away if they turn right. 

This is tricky. Maybe the agent should turn right, then move forward 1 step (but there's a wall 6 steps forward, so moving forward would hit the wall immediately). That doesn't work. 

Alternatively, perhaps the agent should first move forward 1 step towards the wall, then turn right. But moving forward would get them closer to the wall. Wait, but the ball is 1 step forward from their current position. Oh! Wait, in the current observation, the ball is 3 steps right and 1 step forward. So if the agent is facing north, right is east. So the ball is 1 step north and 3 steps east. So the agent needs to move north 1 and east 3. But the wall is 5 steps north, so they can't go north directly. Therefore, they have to go east first, then north. But how? 

If the agent turns right (east), then moves forward, but there's a wall 6 steps east. So moving east isn't possible. Therefore, perhaps the agent needs to go west first, but there's a wall 1 step left (west). That's blocked. 

Wait, maybe the agent's direction is different. Let me try to map it out. 

Assume the agent starts at position (0,0), facing north. The wall forward is at (0,5). The wall to the left (west) is at (-1,0). The yellow ball is at (3,1). 

To reach (3,1), the agent needs to go east 3 and north 1. But north is blocked by a wall at (0,5). So the agent can't go straight north. Therefore, they need to find a path around the wall. 

One possible path is: turn right (east), move forward as far as possible, but there's a wall at (6,0). So that's not helpful. Alternatively, turn left (west), but that's blocked. 

Wait, maybe the agent can go north around the wall. But the wall is 5 steps north. If the agent moves north 1 step, they're at (0,1). Then they can turn east and move to (3,1). That would work. But how to get past the initial wall? 

Wait, in the current observation, the wall is 5 steps forward. So moving forward once would get the agent to (0,1), which is still north of the starting point. Then they can turn right (east) and move 3 steps to (3,1) to get the ball. 

So the steps would be: move forward once, then turn right, move forward three times, then pick up. 

But in the current observation, the agent is facing north, with a wall 5 steps north. So moving forward once gets them to (0,1), which is still north. Then they can turn right (east) and move forward three times to reach (3,1). 

But in the current observation provided, after the previous actions, the agent is back to the initial position. So maybe the agent needs to start moving forward. 

Wait, the current observation is the same as the first one. The user's previous actions were turn right, turn left, and now the current observation is the same as the first. That suggests that the agent turned right, then left, ending up back where they started. So they need to make progress. 

Therefore, the best action is to go forward. Because in the current observation, moving forward once would get them past the immediate wall (since the wall is 5 steps away, but moving one step at a time is allowed). So moving forward would decrease the distance to the wall, allowing them to navigate around it. 

But in the current observation, the ball is 1 step forward. So if the agent moves forward once, they would be 1 step away from the ball's position. Wait, the ball is 3 steps right and 1 step forward. If the agent moves forward once, their new position would be 1 step north. Then, the ball is 3 east and 0 north relative to their new position. So they would need to turn right (east) and move 3 steps to get to the ball. 

Yes, that makes sense. So the agent should first move forward once to get closer, then turn right to face east, move three times to get to the ball, then pick it up. 

But in the current observation, the wall is 5 steps forward. Moving forward once would bring them to 4 steps from the wall, which is still a wall, but they can proceed step by step. 

So the immediate action should be to go forward. That way, they start moving towards the ball's direction and can then adjust their heading.

Let's see what's going on here. The current observation has the agent facing a wall 4 steps forward and another wall 1 step left. The yellow ball is now 3 steps to the right.

Previously, the agent tried turning right and left to change direction, then went forward. Now, after moving forward once, the yellow ball is 3 steps to the right. So I need to figure out how to get to that ball.

The walls are positioned such that moving forward is blocked at 4 steps, and left is blocked at 1 step. So the possible directions to face the ball would be either right or maybe backtracking.

Wait, the agent's current direction isn't specified, but based on the previous moves: first turned right, then left, then went forward. Let me reconstruct the direction changes. Starting direction is unknown, but after turning right, left, then moving forward. Hmm. Maybe the agent is facing a direction where after these moves, the ball is to the right.

Assuming that after turning left from a right direction, the agent would be facing north, then moving forward. Then the ball is 3 steps right. So if facing north, right would be east. So to go east 3 steps to reach the ball. But there's a wall 1 step left (west), so moving west would hit the wall. So the agent needs to turn east (right) and then move forward three times.

Wait, the current observation after moving forward once says the yellow ball is 3 steps right. So maybe the agent is now one step closer to the wall, but the ball is still 3 steps to the right. So the agent needs to turn right (east) to face the direction of the ball and then move forward three times. But let me check the previous observations.

In the first observation, the ball was 3 steps right and 1 forward. Then the agent turned right, then left, then moved forward. After moving forward, the ball is now 3 steps right. So perhaps the agent is now one step forward from the original position, and the ball is three steps to the right. 

If the agent turns right (east), then they can move forward three times to reach the ball. Let me confirm: after turning right, the direction is east. The walls are 1 step left (which would be west) and 4 steps forward (north). So moving east would be possible. So the action should be turn right, then go forward three times. But since the agent can only take one action at a time, the next action should be to turn right to face the east direction, then proceed forward. So the first action needed is to turn right.

Let me try to figure out what to do next. The current observation says there's a wall 3 steps to the right, a green key 3 steps left and 5 steps forward, and a yellow ball 3 steps forward. My goal is first to pick up the yellow ball and then go to the green key.

Looking at the situation, the yellow ball is directly 3 steps forward. Right now, the agent is facing a direction where going forward three steps will get them to the ball. But wait, in the previous steps, the agent was navigating around walls. Let me check the history briefly.

In the last interaction, the user was at a point where the yellow ball was 3 steps right and 1 step forward. The agent turned right, then left, then tried going forward, but maybe hit a wall. Then turned right again and moved forward. Now in this current state, the yellow ball is 3 steps forward. So the agent must be facing the direction where the ball is. 

But let's confirm the path. The walls are 3 steps to the right and 1 step left. So the agent's current facing direction must have a wall on the right (3 steps away) and a wall 1 step to the left. That means the agent is probably facing a corridor where they can go forward, but with walls on the left and right sides. The yellow ball is 3 steps forward, so the agent can go straight there. 

But wait, before picking up the ball, do I need to check if there's any obstacle in the path? The observation only mentions a wall 3 steps right and 1 step left, so the forward path should be clear. Since the yellow ball is directly 3 steps forward, the agent should go forward three times to reach it. Once they reach it, they can pick it up. 

But in the current observation, the yellow ball is 3 steps forward. So the correct action would be to move forward once towards it. After that, the agent can pick it up. However, in the current state, the agent hasn't picked up the ball yet. So the immediate next step is to go forward to get closer. 

Wait, but maybe the agent is already one step away? Let me think again. The observation states the yellow ball is 3 steps forward. If the agent is one step away, then moving forward would get them to the ball. But the agent's current position relative to the ball is 3 steps forward. So the agent needs to move forward three times. However, each time you move forward, the distance decreases by one. So the first move forward would make it 2 steps, then 1, then 0. Once it's 0, the agent is on the ball and can pick it up. 

But in the current observation, the ball is 3 steps away. So the correct action here is to go forward once. After that, the next observation would have the ball 2 steps away, and so on. However, the agent's goal is to pick up the ball first. So the priority is to reach the ball and pick it up. 

But the user's previous steps show that the agent was moving towards the ball, turning and navigating around walls. Now, in this current state, the path to the ball is directly forward, with walls on the left and right. So the agent can proceed straight. 

So the next action should be to go forward once, moving closer to the ball. Once the agent is adjacent (0 steps forward), then they can pick it up. 

But let's check if there's any other considerations. The green key is 3 steps left and 5 steps forward. So after picking up the ball, the agent needs to go to the green key. But first, focus on the ball. 

So the immediate action is to move forward towards the yellow ball. Therefore, the chosen action is ""go forward"".

Let me try to figure out what to do next. The current observation shows a wall to the right, a green key 3 steps left and 4 steps forward, and a yellow ball 2 steps forward.

Earlier in the game, the goal was to first pick up the yellow ball and then go to the green key. From the previous steps, it seems I've already picked up the yellow ball. Wait, let me check the previous actions. The last action was ""go forward"" when the yellow ball was 3 steps forward, so after moving, the yellow ball is now 2 steps forward. But I need to confirm if the ball was picked up already. Looking back at the history, the first action was to turn right to face the ball direction. Then, after moving forward multiple times and adjusting direction, the user should have picked up the ball. Once the ball is picked up, the next step is to go to the green key.

In the current observation, the yellow ball is 2 steps forward. But since I already picked it up earlier, the key is now the target. The green key is located 3 steps left and 4 steps forward. So I need to figure out the direction to move towards the key. The wall to the right might mean that turning left would be necessary to face the direction towards the key. Alternatively, maybe moving forward or adjusting direction again. 

Wait, the current position has the green key at 3 left and 4 forward. The agent's current facing direction might be important. Let me try to visualize. If the agent is facing north, then left would be west. But the key is 3 steps left (west) and 4 forward (north). So perhaps the agent needs to turn left to face west, then move forward towards the key. But the observation mentions walls in certain directions. For example, there's a wall 3 steps right, which would be east if facing north. So maybe the agent is facing north, with a wall to the east (right), and the key is west (left) and north (forward). 

But the key is 3 steps left and 4 steps forward, so combining those, the agent should turn left (west) and then move forward four times, then go left three times. Alternatively, maybe adjust the direction to face the key's direction. But given that there's a wall to the right, turning left seems necessary to head west. So the next action should be to turn left to face west. Wait, but in the previous observation, after turning right, the agent adjusted direction. Let me check the history again. 

In the first step, the observation had the ball 3 steps right and 1 step forward. The agent turned right. Then the next observation had the ball 1 step left and 3 steps forward, so turning left. Then moving forward, etc. Eventually, after picking up the ball, the next target is the green key. 

Now, the green key is 3 steps left and 4 steps forward. Assuming the agent is facing a direction where left leads towards the key's left component. If the agent is facing north, then left is west. The key is 3 west and 4 north. So the agent needs to turn left (west) and then move forward four times, then turn left again (south) to go west three times? That doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe the agent should first move forward towards the key's forward direction. Alternatively, if the agent is facing north, moving forward four steps would get closer to the key's north component, then turn left (west) and move three steps. But need to check if there are walls in the way. 

The current observation mentions a wall 3 steps right (east), but no wall in the forward direction. So moving forward is possible. However, the key is 4 steps forward. So maybe the agent should move forward four times first. But after moving forward, the key's position would change. Let me think step by step. 

Current state: agent has the yellow ball (since earlier actions included picking it up), needs to go to the green key. Key is at 3 left and 4 forward. So directionally, the agent needs to turn left (assuming current facing is north) to face west, then move four steps north (but that's forward), then turn left again to face west and move three steps. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused with directions. 

Alternatively, perhaps the agent should move forward four times first, which would cover the 4 steps forward towards the key, then turn left (west) and move three steps to reach the key's position. However, moving forward four times would bring the agent to the key's forward direction. Then turning left (west) and moving three steps left (which is the key's left component). 

But before that, the agent needs to ensure they are facing the correct direction. Let's assume that after previous movements, the agent is now facing a direction where moving forward gets closer to the key. Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to adjust their orientation. 

Another approach: the green key is 3 steps left and 4 steps forward. So the agent's current direction might be such that left is west and forward is north. So to reach the key, the agent needs to move north four times and west three times. But how to do that without hitting walls. 

The current observation has a wall 3 steps right (east), so moving east is blocked. The wall 5 steps forward (from an earlier observation) might have changed, but now in the current observation, the wall is 3 steps right, and the green key is 3 left and 4 forward. The agent's current position must be such that moving forward is possible. 

So the plan is: first, move forward four times to cover the four steps forward towards the key. Then, turn left (west) and move three steps to reach the key. 

But before moving forward, the agent should check if there are any walls in the path. The current observation shows a wall 3 steps right but no wall in the forward direction. So moving forward is safe. 

But wait, the yellow ball was picked up already, so the agent is holding it. The goal is to go to the green key, so the agent needs to reach the key's location. Once at the key's location, they can toggle or pick it up (assuming the key is on the ground). 

So the steps would be: move forward four times, turn left, move three times, then toggle to pick up the key. 

But in the current observation, the green key is 3 steps left and 4 steps forward. So after moving forward four steps, the forward distance to the key would be zero, and the left distance is three. Then turn left (west) and move three steps. 

However, in the current observation, the agent's position has the green key at 3 left and 4 forward. So the agent needs to adjust their direction. Let's say the agent is currently facing north. To get to the key, which is northwest (3 west, 4 north), the agent can either go north first then west, or west then north. 

But moving north four steps (forward) would bring them to the point where the key is 3 west. Then turning left (west) and moving three steps reaches the key. 

So the immediate next action should be to move forward once, reducing the forward distance to 3. But the current observation shows the green key is 3 steps left and 4 forward. So moving forward once would make it 3 left and 3 forward. Then repeat. 

But since the agent has to do this step by step, the next action should be to move forward. However, after moving forward four times, the agent would be at the key's forward position. Then turn left and move three times. 

But looking at the current observation, the green key is 3 steps left and 4 forward. So the agent needs to move forward four times. But each move forward would decrement the forward distance by one. So the next action is to go forward. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent is facing east, and the key is to the west and north. But that might complicate things. 

Wait, let's consider the agent's orientation. Let's assume that in the first steps, the agent turned right to face south (if initially facing north), then moved forward. But this is getting too speculative. 

Alternatively, perhaps the optimal action here is to move forward, as the key is still 4 steps forward, and moving closer. Then after four moves, turn left and move three. 

But the problem is that the agent has to choose one action at a time. So in the current state, the green key is 3 left and 4 forward. The agent needs to adjust their direction. If they are facing north, then left is west. So to go west three steps and north four, the agent can either turn left (west) and move three, then move north four, but that would require turning north again, which might not be possible if there's a wall. 

Alternatively, move north four times first (forward four times), then turn left (west) and move three. That seems feasible. 

So the next action should be to go forward, reducing the forward distance to 3. Then repeat this until forward is 0. 

But the current observation shows the green key is 3 left and 4 forward. So moving forward once would make it 3 left and 3 forward. Then next action is go forward again, and so on. 

Therefore, the immediate next step is to go forward.

Let's see. The goal is to pick up the yellow ball first and then go to the green key. From the current observation, the yellow ball is 1 step forward. So, I need to get to that ball.

Looking at the previous steps, the user has already navigated to the ball's location. In the last few observations, they were moving forward step by step, getting closer. Now, the ball is directly 1 step ahead. Since the agent hasn't picked up the ball yet, the next logical step is to move forward to reach it. Once they're right in front of the ball, they can use the 'pick up' action. But according to the current observation, the ball is 1 step forward, so moving forward once will place them next to it. Then, they can pick it up. 

Wait, but the user's previous actions included moving forward multiple times. Let me check the last few observations again. The current observation has the yellow ball 1 step forward. Before that, it was 2, then 1. So the agent is getting close. But in the current state, they need to take one more step to reach the ball. Once they do that, they can pick it up. Then, after picking up the ball, they need to go to the green key, which is 3 steps left and 3 steps forward. 

Wait, but the agent's inventory isn't mentioned here. Are they holding anything? The problem states the goal is to pick up the yellow ball first. So the priority is to pick it up. So the immediate action should be to move forward to get to the ball, then pick it up. 

Looking at the possible actions: go forward, turn left/right, pick up, etc. Since the ball is directly 1 step forward, the correct action is 'go forward' to get into position to pick it up. Once they go forward, the next observation should show the ball at 0 steps forward, allowing them to use 'pick up'. 

So the next step here is to move forward. Then, after picking up, navigate to the green key. But in the current observation, since the ball is 1 step forward, moving forward now is necessary. The agent can't pick up the ball unless they are adjacent to it. So the correct action here is 'go forward'.

Once I pick that up, then I need to navigate to the green key, which is 3 steps left and 3 steps forward from where I am now. But first things first, I need to get the ball.

Let's see where I am right now. After picking up the yellow ball, my next objective is to go to the green key. The current observation shows that I'm carrying the yellow ball, there's a wall 4 steps forward and another wall 3 steps to the right. The green key is located 3 steps left and 3 steps forward.

Hmm, I need to figure out the direction to move towards the key. Since the key is 3 steps left and 3 steps forward, I need to adjust my heading. But where am I facing right now? The previous actions might have turned me in a certain direction. Let's recap the steps:

1. Initial position: Yellow ball is 3 steps right and 1 forward. I turned right, then left, moved forward a few times, turned right again, and approached the ball. After picking it up, the key is now 3 left and 3 forward.

Wait, after picking up the ball, I need to navigate to the key. Since the key is to the left and forward, I need to face a direction where moving forward will take me towards the key. Let's assume my current facing direction. Let's trace back the movement:

- After the last 'pick up' action, the observation showed the key at 3 left and 3 forward. Before that, the key was getting closer as I moved forward three times. So, after picking up the ball, I was probably facing north, and the key is to the west (left) and still a bit north (forward). Wait, but in the last few observations, the key was moving closer in forward direction each time I went forward. So maybe after picking up the ball, I need to turn left to face west (since the key is 3 left and 3 forward), then move forward three times. But wait, the walls are to the right (3 steps right) and forward (4 steps forward). So moving forward might hit a wall if I'm not careful.

Alternatively, maybe I need to turn left to face west, then move forward towards the key. Let's check the current observation again: green key is 3 steps left and 3 steps forward. If I'm facing north, left would be west. So turn left to face west, then move forward three steps to reach the key. But wait, after turning left, moving forward three steps would get me to the key's location. But I need to confirm the direction. Alternatively, maybe I need to turn around. Wait, after picking up the ball, the key's position is 3 left and 3 forward. If I'm currently facing north, left is west, so moving left (turning left) and then forward three times. But before moving, I should check if there's a wall in that path. The observation mentions a wall 3 steps right, which would be east if I'm facing north. So moving west (left) is clear. So the plan is: turn left (to face west), then go forward three times to reach the key. Then toggle to pick it up. But wait, the key is in front, so once I'm facing it, toggle would interact with it. But the action 'toggle' is needed to pick up the key. Let me verify the actions again. The allowed actions are turn left, right, go forward, pick up, drop, toggle. To interact with the key, I need to toggle it when it's in front. So after reaching the key's location by moving forward three times (assuming each go forward moves one step), then use toggle. So the steps would be:

1. Turn left (facing west)
2. Go forward three times (since key is 3 steps forward now)
3. Toggle to pick up the green key

But wait, in the current observation, after picking up the yellow ball, the green key is 3 steps left and 3 steps forward. So if I turn left (west), then moving forward three steps would position me in front of the key. Then toggle to pick it up. So the next action after pick up is to turn left. However, the current observation shows that after picking up the yellow ball, the key is 3 left and 3 forward. So I need to turn left first. So the first action should be 'turn left' to face the correct direction. Then move forward three times. But since the observation says the key is 3 steps forward after turning left, I can go forward once. Wait, but each 'go forward' action moves one step. So if the key is 3 steps forward, I need to press 'go forward' three times. But the tip says not to repeat the same action if the observation doesn't change. So after each 'go forward', the observation should update the key's position. Let's check:

After turning left, first 'go forward' would make the key 2 steps forward. Then another 'go forward' makes it 1 step, then the next makes it 0 steps (in front). Then toggle. So the sequence would be:

turn left
go forward
go forward
go forward
toggle

But the user wants me to choose the next action. The current observation after picking up the ball is:

Carrying yellow ball
Wall 4 steps forward
Wall 3 steps right
Green key 3 steps left and 3 steps forward

So the first step is to turn left to face west (since left from north is west). Then, moving forward three times. So the next action should be 'turn left'. Once that's done, the next observation would have the key at 3 steps forward. Then 'go forward' three times. So the immediate next action is to 'turn left' to face the correct direction towards the key.

The agent's goal is to pick up the yellow ball and then go to the green key. Let's look at the current observation.

First, the agent is carrying the yellow ball already, which means that part of the task is done. Now, the main thing is to reach the green key. The observation says the green key is 3 steps right and 3 steps forward. 

Looking around, there's a wall 4 steps forward and a wall 3 steps left. So the agent's current direction must be such that moving forward is blocked by a wall. The green key's position is to the right and forward. Since there's a wall to the left (3 steps left), the agent can't go left. The forward direction is blocked by a wall (4 steps forward), so moving straight isn't an option. 

The agent needs to navigate towards the green key. The key is 3 steps right and 3 forward. The agent's current facing direction isn't clear, but based on previous observations, they might have turned left after picking up the ball. Let me check the previous steps. 

In the last observation before picking up the ball, the agent was facing forward, and after picking it up, they turned left. So now, facing left. But wait, the current observation shows a wall 3 steps left. Wait, that might mean the agent is facing a different direction. Maybe after turning left, they adjusted their direction. 

Wait, the agent's current orientation isn't explicitly stated. The observations mention relative positions of walls and objects. Let's try to deduce the direction. 

In the previous step, after picking up the ball, the agent turned left. Then the observation showed a wall 4 steps forward and a wall 3 steps left. The green key was 3 steps right and 3 steps forward. So if the agent turned left, their new forward direction would be to the left relative to their original direction. But the green key is to the right (3 steps right) which would be the opposite direction of their current forward. Hmm, maybe that's not right. 

Alternatively, if the agent turned left, their forward direction is now left, so moving forward would take them left, which is blocked by a wall. The green key is 3 steps right (which would be the agent's backward direction?) and 3 steps forward (which would be their left direction). Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. 

Alternatively, perhaps the agent should turn right to face a direction where they can move towards the key. If the green key is 3 steps right and 3 forward, maybe the agent needs to turn right (so their forward direction aligns with the key's position). Let's think: if the agent turns right, then moving forward would be in the direction where the key is 3 steps forward and 3 steps right. Wait, but the key's position is 3 steps right and 3 steps forward from the agent's current position. So if the agent turns right, their forward direction is now to the right, and moving forward would take them towards the key's forward direction. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to first move right to reduce the distance to the key's right component. But the key is 3 steps right and 3 forward. The agent is currently facing a direction where moving forward is blocked. So perhaps turning right would allow them to move forward towards the key. 

In the current observation, after turning left, the wall is 3 steps left, and the green key is 3 right and 3 forward. If the agent turns right, their new forward direction would be to the right, and moving forward would reduce the distance to the key's forward component. Let's see: turning right would make the agent face a direction where moving forward is towards the key's forward (3 steps) and moving right would be towards the key's right (3 steps). Wait, but maybe that's not aligned. 

Alternatively, the agent could turn around. But turning around would require two left turns or two right turns. However, the action list only includes turn left and right once per step. 

Alternatively, the agent could go forward, but the observation says there's a wall 4 steps forward, so that's not possible. 

So the best options are to turn right or left. The green key is to the right and forward. If the agent turns right, their forward direction aligns with moving towards the key's forward direction. Let's say turning right makes the agent face a direction where moving forward 3 steps would get them to the key's forward position, and then moving right 3 steps. But since the key is both right and forward, perhaps turning right allows the agent to move forward towards the key's forward direction while also heading in the right direction. 

Alternatively, after turning right, moving forward three times would reach the key. So the sequence would be: turn right, go forward three times, then pick up the key. But the agent already has the yellow ball, so the task is to reach the green key. 

Wait, in the current observation, the agent is carrying the yellow ball, and the green key is 3 steps right and 3 steps forward. The walls are 4 steps forward and 3 steps left. So the agent's current position is such that to go towards the key, they need to move right and forward. But moving forward is blocked by a wall. Therefore, the agent must turn to face a direction where they can move towards the key without hitting the wall. 

If the agent turns right, their new forward direction would be to the right, which is away from the wall. Then moving forward would take them towards the key's forward direction (since the key is 3 steps right and 3 forward from the current position). Wait, perhaps this is getting too abstract. Let's visualize it. 

Assume the agent is at position (0,0). The green key is at (3,3). The walls are at (0,4) forward, and (-3,0) left. Wait, but the walls' positions are relative. If the agent is facing north, then forward is north, left is west. If the agent turns left (now facing west), then left from their perspective is south. The walls are 3 steps left (south) and 4 steps forward (west). The key is 3 steps right (east) and 3 steps forward (west). That would place the key at (-3+3, 0-3) = (0, -3), which doesn't make sense. Maybe the coordinates are relative to the agent's current facing. 

This is getting complicated. Maybe the best approach is to look at the relative directions. The agent needs to go 3 steps right and 3 steps forward from their current position to reach the key. But they can't move forward because there's a wall. So they need to turn right to face a direction where moving forward would be towards the key. 

If the agent turns right, their new forward direction is to the right (east), and moving forward three steps would take them east 3, which aligns with the key's right component (3 steps right). Then, after moving east 3, they would need to move north 3 steps to reach the key. But moving north would require another turn. Wait, this is confusing. 

Alternatively, after turning right, moving forward three steps would take the agent towards the key's right direction, and then they could turn another right to face north and move forward. But the key is 3 steps right and 3 forward, which might require moving right and then forward. 

Alternatively, perhaps the agent should first turn right to face east, then move forward three steps (right direction), which would get them to the key's right position, and then turn north and move forward three steps. But the key's forward direction from the agent's current position is west, which is blocked. This is getting too tangled. 

Looking at the current observation again: walls are 4 steps forward and 3 steps left. The key is 3 steps right and 3 steps forward. So if the agent turns right, their forward direction is now to the right (east). The key is 3 steps east (right) and 3 steps forward (north?), but the original forward direction might have been north. If the agent is now facing east, then moving forward would be east, but the key is 3 east and 3 forward (which would be north-east). Hmm, not sure. 

Alternatively, maybe the key is 3 steps to the agent's right (east) and 3 steps in the direction the agent is currently facing (north). So from the agent's current position, turning right (east) and moving forward three steps gets them east 3, then turning north (another right turn) and moving forward three steps to reach the key. But that would require two turns and multiple moves. 

But the agent's current observation shows that after turning left, the walls are 3 steps left and 4 steps forward. The key is 3 right and 3 forward. So perhaps the agent needs to turn right to face a direction where moving forward and right gets them to the key. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent should first turn right to face a direction where moving forward three times would take them towards the key's position. 

In any case, the immediate action needed is to navigate towards the green key while avoiding walls. Since moving forward is blocked, turning right or left might be the way. 

If the agent turns right, their forward direction is now to the right (east), and the key is 3 east and 3 forward (north-east). But moving east three steps would get them to the key's east component, then they need to move north three steps, which would require another turn. 

Alternatively, turning left again would face west, but there's a wall 3 steps left (west). So that's not helpful. 

So the best action is to turn right to face a direction where they can move towards the key without hitting walls. Then move forward as needed. 

In the current observation, after turning right, the agent can move forward towards the key's east direction. So the next action should be to turn right to align their movement towards the key.

Let me try to figure this out. The goal is to pick up the yellow ball and then go to the green key. The user has already picked up the yellow ball, so now the next step is to reach the green key.

Looking at the current observation: there's a wall 4 steps forward, a wall 3 steps to the right, and the green key is 3 steps left and 3 steps forward. Wait, the orientation might matter here. The agent's current direction isn't specified in the observation, so I need to infer based on previous actions.

In previous steps, the agent turned left and right to adjust direction. Let's see the sequence:

1. Initial observation had the ball 3 steps right and 1 forward. Turned right.
2. Next observation, ball moved left 1 and forward 3. Turned left.
3. Then went forward a few times, adjusting position.
4. Finally picked up the ball.
5. After picking up, turned left, then right, adjusting to face the green key.

In the latest observation, the green key is 3 steps left and 3 forward. The walls are 4 forward and 3 right. So, if the agent is facing the direction where the green key is 3 left and 3 forward, they might need to turn left to face left and then move forward. But let's check the prior steps.

After picking up the ball, the agent turned left (Observation 10) which changed the walls to 3 steps left instead of right. Then turned right (Observation 11) to face right again, but the green key is now 3 steps left and 3 forward. Wait, maybe the current direction is such that left is towards the key.

If the green key is 3 steps left and 3 forward, the agent needs to either turn left and then move forward, or check if they can go forward first and then left. But there's a wall 4 steps forward, so moving forward directly would hit a wall. Therefore, the agent needs to adjust direction to avoid the wall and get towards the key.

Since the walls are 3 steps right and 4 forward, the open directions are possibly left and backward? But backward isn't listed as an action. So the agent can turn left or right. 

In the current observation, walls are 3 right and 4 forward. The green key is 3 left and 3 forward. So if the agent turns left, they would face a direction where the key is 3 forward and some steps left. But since moving forward 3 steps would reach the key, maybe they need to turn left to face that direction. Alternatively, check if they need to go forward first, but there's a wall. 

Wait, the agent can't go forward because the wall is 4 steps forward. So the only options are to turn left or right. Turning left would make the green key 3 steps forward, which is directly in front. Because if the agent turns left, their new forward direction would align with the green key's position. Let me visualize this:

Assuming the agent is currently facing a direction where forward is blocked by a wall (4 steps), right is blocked by a wall (3 steps). The green key is 3 steps left and 3 forward. If the agent turns left, their new forward direction would be to the left of their current forward. So the key being 3 left and 3 forward from the original position would now be 3 steps forward in the new direction. That makes sense. So turning left would allow the agent to face the key directly, 3 steps forward. Then they can go forward three times to reach the key. Then toggle to pick it up.

So the correct action here is to turn left, which aligns the agent's forward direction towards the green key. Then proceed with go forward multiple times and toggle.

Let's try to figure this out. The goal is to pick up the yellow ball first, which I already did in the previous steps. Now I need to go to the green key. Looking at the current observation, I'm carrying the yellow ball. The walls are 4 steps forward and 3 steps left. The green key is 3 steps right and 3 steps forward.

Hmm, so from my current position, how do I get to the green key? Let me visualize the directions. If there's a wall to the left (3 steps left) and a wall in front (4 steps forward), but the green key is to the right and forward. Wait, the key is 3 steps right and 3 steps forward. But I can't go right because there's a wall 3 steps to the right. So maybe I need to adjust my direction first.

Wait, the previous steps had me turning left and right to navigate. Let me check the last actions. The user just turned left, and now the green key is 3 steps right and 3 steps forward. But if there's a wall 3 steps right, how can the key be there? Maybe my current orientation is such that right is blocked, but the key is in a different direction relative to my facing.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to turn around. If the wall is 3 steps right, maybe I'm facing a direction where right is blocked, but the key is in another direction. Let me think: if I'm facing north, then right would be east. If there's a wall to the east (3 steps), but the key is 3 steps east and 3 steps north. But that can't be, because if I'm facing north and there's a wall 3 steps east, then moving east would hit the wall. But the key is in that direction. Maybe I need to go forward first, then adjust.

Wait, the current observation says the green key is 3 steps right and 3 steps forward. But if moving right is blocked by a wall, that suggests that 'right' here refers to my current orientation. So maybe I need to turn in a different direction to face where the key is. For example, if I turn left (so now facing west), then the key's position relative to me would change. Let me recast the directions.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check the previous steps to see my orientation. Let's recap the actions taken:

1. Initial turn right.
2. Then turn left.
3. Go forward a few times.
4. Turn right, then go forward until the yellow ball is picked up.
5. After picking up, turned left, then right, left again, leading to current position with the key 3 steps right and forward, but right is blocked.

Wait, maybe after picking up the ball, the green key's position is now visible. Let's see. The current observation shows the green key at 3 steps right and 3 forward. But the wall is 3 steps right. That's a contradiction. Unless the wall is in the way, making the key unreachable? That can't be. Maybe I need to adjust my direction to face towards the key.

If the key is 3 right and 3 forward, but there's a wall 3 right, perhaps the key is actually in a different direction. Maybe I'm facing south, so right would be east, but there's a wall east. The key is 3 east and 3 south. But moving south 3 steps would hit the wall (4 steps forward is a wall, which would be north if facing south). Hmm, this is getting confusing.

Alternatively, maybe I need to go forward first. If I go forward 3 steps, but there's a wall 4 steps forward. Wait, the current observation says a wall 4 steps forward. If I go forward once, then there's a wall 3 steps forward. But the key is 3 steps right and 3 steps forward. So if I go forward, then I'm 3 steps forward from the current position, and the key is 3 steps right from there. But how do I get to the right? If moving right is blocked by a wall, maybe I need to turn left or right to face a direction where the key is accessible.

Alternatively, maybe the key is behind me. Wait, but the key's position is 3 right and 3 forward. So relative to my current facing direction, right and forward. If I turn left, then my forward direction changes. Let me think: if I'm facing north, turning left makes me face west. Then, moving forward would be west, and right would be south. But the key is 3 steps right (south) and 3 steps forward (west). But the wall is 3 steps left (east) and 4 steps forward (north). So if I turn left, then my forward is west, right is south. The key is 3 steps right (south) and 3 steps forward (west). So from my new position after turning left, moving forward 3 steps west would reach the key's forward position, then turning right (now facing south) and moving 3 steps. But there's a wall 3 steps right (south) in the current observation? Wait, no, the current observation after picking up the ball says the wall is 3 steps right and 3 steps left. Wait, the latest observation before the current one was:

Observation:
You carry a yellow ball
a wall 4 steps forward
a wall 3 steps left
a green key 3 steps right and 3 steps forward

Then the user turned left, leading to the next observation where the green key is 3 steps right and 3 steps forward, but walls are 4 forward and 3 left. Then turned right, leading to current observation where walls are 4 forward, 3 right, and green key is 3 left and 3 forward. Wait, maybe my orientation changes with each turn, affecting the directions of the key and walls.

This is getting complicated. Let's try to track the orientation step by step.

Assuming the agent starts facing north.

1. First action: turn right → now facing east.
2. Next observation: yellow ball is 1 step left and 3 forward. If facing east, left would be north. So the ball is north 1 and east 3. But the observation says 1 left and 3 forward. Hmm, maybe directions are relative to current facing. So left is west if facing east. Wait, maybe the directions are absolute. Wait, the problem doesn't specify if directions are relative or absolute. That's a key point.

If directions are relative (i.e., based on the agent's current orientation), then turning left or right changes the reference frame. But if they're absolute, then north, south, etc., stay the same. The problem statement isn't clear. But in many navigation tasks, directions are relative to the agent's facing.

Assuming relative directions:

- Initially facing north.
- Turn right → east.
- Now, left would be west, right is south, forward is east.
- In the second observation, the yellow ball is 1 step left and 3 forward. If left is west and forward is east, then the ball is 1 west and 3 east from current position. That would place it 2 steps north overall. But the actual position might be different.

This is getting too confusing without a map. Maybe a better approach is to focus on the current observation and possible actions.

Current Observation:
- Carrying yellow ball.
- Wall 4 steps forward.
- Wall 3 steps left.
- Green key 3 steps right and 3 steps forward.

So, if I'm facing north:

- Forward is north, blocked by a wall at 4 steps.
- Left is west, blocked by a wall at 3 steps.
- Green key is 3 steps right (east) and 3 steps forward (north). But there's a wall 4 steps forward (north), so moving north 3 steps would reach the wall at step 4, meaning the key is just before the wall? That doesn't make sense. Or perhaps the wall is 4 steps forward, but the key is 3 steps forward and 3 right. So if I turn right (east), then the key is 3 steps forward (east) and 3 steps right (south). But there's a wall 3 steps right (south) in the current observation. Wait, the current observation says the wall is 3 steps right, which would be south if facing east. So the key is 3 east and 3 south from current position. But moving east 3 steps would hit the wall (since the wall is 3 steps right, which is south when facing east). Hmm, this is conflicting.

Alternatively, if facing east:

- Right is south, left is north.
- Wall 3 steps left (north) and 4 steps forward (east).
- Green key is 3 steps right (south) and 3 steps forward (east).
- So from current position, moving east 3 steps would hit the wall at 4 steps forward. Then, moving south 3 steps from there would reach the key. But how to get there? Maybe turn around? If I turn left (now facing north), then the wall is 3 steps left (west) and 4 steps forward (north). The key is 3 steps right (east) and 3 steps forward (north). But the wall is 4 steps north, so moving north 3 steps would reach the key's forward position, then move east 3 steps. But there's a wall at 3 steps east (now facing north, east would be original east direction, which has a wall at 4 steps). Wait, this is getting too tangled.

Perhaps the best action is to move forward as much as possible, but the wall is 4 steps forward, so moving forward once would get to step 1, then step 2, etc., but eventually hit the wall. Alternatively, turn to face a direction where the key is accessible.

Looking at the current observation, the green key is 3 steps right and 3 forward. If I can turn left or right to face a direction where I can go right and forward without hitting the wall.

If I turn left (now facing west):

- Forward would be west.
- Right would be south.
- The green key is 3 steps right (south) and 3 steps forward (west).
- Wall is 3 steps left (east) and 4 steps forward (west).
- So moving forward 3 steps west would reach the wall at 4 steps, but the key is 3 steps forward. So maybe after moving forward 3 steps west, I'm at the wall, but the key is 3 steps south from there. But how to get there?

Alternatively, if I turn right (now facing south):

- Forward is south.
- Right is east.
- The green key is 3 steps right (east) and 3 steps forward (south).
- Wall is 3 steps right (east) and 4 steps forward (south).
- So moving forward 3 steps south would reach the wall at 4 steps, and the key is 3 steps east from there. But there's a wall 3 steps east (which is now the original east direction), so can't go east.

This is confusing. Maybe the only way is to try moving forward a few steps, but the wall is blocking. Alternatively, toggle an object, but there's nothing to toggle mentioned.

Wait, the current observation doesn't mention any door or interactable object except the key and ball. Since the key is the target, I need to reach it. But the problem is the directions seem conflicting with the walls.

Alternatively, maybe the key is behind the wall? But that's not possible. The agent must find a path around.

Another approach: since the agent must go to the green key after picking up the ball, perhaps the path involves turning in a certain direction to avoid the wall and reach the key.

In the current observation, after picking up the ball, the agent is facing a direction where right is blocked by a wall, and forward is also blocked after 4 steps. The key is 3 right and 3 forward. So if the agent turns left, perhaps they can move forward and then right to reach the key.

For example:

1. Turn left (now facing west).
2. Move forward 3 steps (but wall is 4 steps forward in this direction? Wait, original wall was 4 steps forward when facing north. If now facing west, the wall 4 steps forward would be west. But in the current observation, the wall is 4 steps forward regardless of direction? That can't be. Directions must be relative.

This is really tricky without knowing the agent's exact orientation. Maybe the best action is to turn left or right to face a direction where the key is accessible.

Looking at the current observation, the green key is 3 steps right and 3 forward. If I turn left, then my right would be south, and forward is west. The key is 3 south and 3 west. But there's a wall 3 steps left (which would be east when facing west). So moving west 3 steps would hit the wall at 4 steps, then the key is 3 south from there, but can't go south past the wall.

Alternatively, turn right (now facing south). Then forward is south, right is east. The key is 3 east and 3 south. But the wall is 3 steps right (east) and 4 steps forward (south). So moving south 3 steps would reach the wall at 4 steps, then the key is 3 east from there, but there's a wall there. So that's blocked.

Hmm. This is a dead end. Maybe the agent needs to move forward as much as possible and then adjust direction. But the wall is 4 steps forward, so moving forward once gets to step 1, but then further steps would hit the wall.

Wait, the current observation says the wall is 4 steps forward. So if I move forward once, I'm at step 1, then again to step 2, step 3, step 4 (wall). So I can move forward 3 times. But where does that get me? If the key is 3 steps forward and 3 right from the current position, moving forward 3 steps would place me 3 steps forward, and then I need to go 3 steps right. But the wall is 3 steps right in the current observation, which would be in the same direction regardless of movement? Maybe not. If I move forward 3 steps, my orientation doesn't change, so right is still the same direction. If there's a wall 3 steps right from the original position, then after moving forward, right is still 3 steps, but now from the new position. Wait, no. Directions are relative to the agent's current facing. So if the agent moves forward, their position changes, but their facing remains the same. So the wall's position is relative to their new position.

This is really complicated. Maybe the key is in a different direction relative to the agent's movement. Let's try to outline possible steps:

1. Current position: facing a direction where forward is blocked by a wall at 4 steps, right is blocked by a wall at 3 steps, key is 3 right and 3 forward.

Assuming the agent needs to reach the key, which is to their right and forward, but those directions are blocked by walls. This suggests that the agent's current orientation is such that the key is behind a wall. But that can't be. There must be a path.

Perhaps the agent needs to turn around. For example, if the agent turns 180 degrees (two right turns or two left turns), facing south. Then, the wall that was 4 steps forward (north) is now 4 steps backward. The key's position relative to the new facing would be different. Let's see:

- After turning right twice (facing south):
  - Forward is south.
  - Right is east.
  - The green key was originally 3 steps right and 3 forward from the original position. If the original position was facing north, then the key is 3 east and 3 north. After turning south, the key's position relative to the new facing would be 3 north (which is backward 3 steps) and 3 east (right 3 steps). So the key is 3 steps backward and 3 steps right. But the agent is carrying the ball, so they need to go to the key's original position, which is now behind them.

But how do they get there? They would have to move backward 3 steps, but movement is only forward. Unless the agent can toggle a door, but there's no indication of that.

Alternatively, maybe the key is in a different part of the map. Given that after picking up the ball, the agent's path changed, perhaps the key's position is now adjusted.

This is quite challenging without a clear map. Given the current observation and the need to reach the green key, the possible actions are turn left, turn right, go forward (up to 3 steps), toggle, or drop. Since the agent is already holding the yellow ball, drop isn't useful here.

The key is 3 steps right and 3 forward. The walls are 4 steps forward and 3 steps left. If I turn left, then my forward direction is west, and right is south. The key is 3 steps right (south) and 3 forward (west). So moving west 3 steps would get to the key's forward position, then turning right (south) and moving 3 steps. But is there a wall in that path?

In the current observation, after turning left, the walls would be:

- Wall 3 steps left (which would be east when facing west).
- Wall 4 steps forward (west).

So moving west 3 steps would reach the wall at step 4, but the key is 3 steps forward (west) and 3 right (south). So after moving west 3 steps, I'm at the wall, then need to go south 3 steps. But how? The agent can't move past the wall. This suggests that turning left isn't the way.

Alternatively, turn right (facing south). Then forward is south, right is east. The key is 3 east and 3 south. Wall is 3 steps right (east) and 4 steps forward (south). So moving south 3 steps would reach the wall at 4 steps, then the key is 3 east from there, but there's a wall there. So that's blocked.

Hmm. This seems like a dead end. Maybe the agent needs to move forward as much as possible and then try a different direction. For example:

1. Move forward 3 steps (since wall is at 4 steps).
2. Now, position is 3 steps forward from original.
3. Then, turn left or right to face a direction where the key is.

But where would the key be in this new position? Let's say after moving forward 3 steps, the agent's new position has the key 3 steps right and 0 steps forward (since they moved forward already). But the original key was 3 right and 3 forward, so after moving forward 3, the key is 3 right in the new position. But there's a wall 3 steps right in the","

Your previous output did not contain a valid action. Defaulted to action: go forward

12,turn right,"<reasoning>
Let's see. The goal is to pick up the yellow ball and then go to the green key. I already picked up the ball in a previous step, so now I just need to get to the green key.

Looking at the current observation, I'm carrying the yellow ball. The walls are 3 steps forward and 3 steps left. The green key is 3 steps right and 2 steps forward. 

Hmm, how do I reach the key? The walls are blocking my straight path. If I go forward, there's a wall 3 steps ahead. So maybe I need to turn to face a direction where the key is accessible. 

The key is to the right and forward. If I'm facing north, turning right would make me face east. From there, going forward might get me closer. But wait, the key is 3 steps right and 2 forward. Let me visualize this. 

If I turn right (east), then go forward twice, that would get me to the key's position. But I need to check the path. The wall is 3 steps left, which would be west. So facing east, the walls would be to the west (3 steps) and forward 3 steps. Wait, the observation says a wall 3 steps forward. So if I'm facing east, there's a wall 3 steps ahead. That's a problem. 

Wait, the key is 3 steps right and 2 steps forward. If I'm facing east, moving right would be south. That doesn't make sense. Maybe I need to adjust my direction. Let me think again. 

If the key is 3 steps right and 2 steps forward from my current position, and assuming I'm facing north initially, turning right (east) and then moving forward 2 steps would get me to the key's location. But there's a wall 3 steps forward when facing east, so that path is blocked. 

Alternatively, maybe I should turn left (west) instead. If I turn left, facing west, then moving forward might not have a wall. The wall to the left (west) is 3 steps, but that's in the same direction. Wait, the observation says a wall 3 steps forward. If I'm facing west, then moving forward would hit the wall after 3 steps. The key is 3 steps right (which would be south) and 2 steps forward (west). That seems conflicting. 

Maybe I need to check the directions again. Let's consider my current orientation. Suppose I'm facing north. The walls: 3 steps forward (north), 3 steps left (west). The key is 3 steps right (east) and 2 steps forward (north). Wait, that would mean the key is east and north from me. So if I'm facing north, turning right (east) and then moving forward 2 steps would get me to the key. But there's a wall 3 steps forward when facing east. So that path is blocked. 

Hmm, maybe I need to go around the wall. If I turn right (east), but there's a wall 3 steps forward, perhaps I need to go left around it? But turning left from facing north would be west, and the wall is 3 steps to the left (west), but moving forward would still hit the wall. 

Wait, perhaps I need to reorient myself. Let me try turning right twice to face south. Then the wall is 3 steps to the right (east) and 3 steps forward (south). The key is east (3 steps) and north (2 steps). Wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe I need to approach the key by moving in a different direction. 

Alternatively, after picking up the ball, the next step is to navigate to the green key. Since the key's position is 3 steps right and 2 forward from the current position, and considering possible orientations, perhaps turning right (east) and moving forward twice would work. But the wall is in the way. 

Wait, maybe the previous step's action led to this configuration. Let me recap the previous steps. The user had to pick up the yellow ball by moving around the walls, then navigate to the green key. Now, the key is 3 right and 2 forward, but facing a wall. 

Perhaps I need to alternate turning and moving forward to position myself correctly. For example, turn left to face a different direction, then move forward until the key comes into view without walls blocking. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to go around the wall by moving forward a bit, then turning. But given the current observation, moving forward would hit the wall. 

Wait, the current observation says a wall 3 steps forward. So if I go forward, I can't. So I need to turn to face a direction where the key is accessible. Let's think: the key is 3 steps right and 2 forward. Assuming I'm facing north, right is east. So if I can get to a position where facing east, then moving 2 steps forward (but there's a wall 3 steps east). Hmm, that's not possible. 

Wait, maybe the agent is facing a different direction. Suppose after picking up the ball, the agent turned left multiple times. Let's say the agent turned left once (now facing west), then moved forward. But according to the previous observations, after picking up the ball, the agent turned left, then right, etc., leading to this current position. 

Alternatively, perhaps I need to adjust my direction. Let's try turning right again. If I turn right (from current facing direction, which is not north anymore), maybe that opens up a path. 

Wait, the current observation after picking up the ball shows walls at 3 steps forward and 3 steps left. If the agent is facing east, then forward is east, left is south. The key is 3 steps right (south) and 2 steps forward (east). So if facing east, moving forward 2 steps would reach the key's forward position, but then turning right (south) 3 steps to get to the key. But there's a wall 3 steps forward (east). So that's not possible. 

Alternatively, if facing south, then right is west, forward is south. The key is 3 steps right (west) and 2 steps forward (south). So moving west 3 steps and south 2 steps. But moving forward (south) 2 steps would reach the key's position. But the wall is 3 steps forward (south), so moving 2 steps forward would still be okay. Wait, the wall is 3 steps forward, so moving 2 steps forward would not hit the wall. So if I turn to face south, then move forward 2 steps, that would get me to the key's location. 

But how do I turn to face south? Let's see. Current facing direction: after previous actions, maybe the agent is facing north. To face south, turn right twice. So first turn right (east), then right again (south). Then move forward 2 steps. That would place the agent at the key's position. 

But the observation says the key is 3 steps right and 2 steps forward. If facing south, right is west, forward is south. So moving forward 2 steps (south) would be 2 steps forward, and then turning right (west) 3 steps. But the key is 3 steps right (west) and 2 steps forward (south), so yes, that would place the agent at the key. 

But how does the current observation align with this? The current observation says the key is 3 steps right and 2 steps forward. If the agent is facing south, right is west, forward is south. So moving forward 2 steps (south) brings the agent to the forward position of the key, then turning right (west) 3 steps would reach the key. But the key is in that position. So maybe the correct sequence is turn right (to face east), then turn right again (to face south), then go forward 2 steps. 

But in the current observation, after picking up the ball, the agent turned left, then right, etc. Let's try to track the direction changes. 

Starting from the initial position where the yellow ball was picked up. After that, the agent turned left, then right, left, etc., leading to the current observation. But without knowing the exact sequence of directions, it's tricky. 

Alternatively, perhaps the best action here is to turn left to face west, then move forward until the key is in reach. Wait, but moving forward would hit the wall (3 steps forward). 

Alternatively, turn right twice to face south, then move forward 2 steps. That might work. 

So the action sequence would be: turn right, turn right, go forward. 

But since the agent can only take one action at a time, the first action should be to turn right (to face east), then another turn right (to face south), then go forward 2. But in the current observation, the agent needs to take one action. 

Given the current observation, the walls are 3 steps forward and 3 steps left. The key is 3 steps right and 2 steps forward. 

If the agent turns right (to face east), then the wall is 3 steps forward (east), so moving forward isn't possible. 

If the agent turns left (to face west), then the wall is 3 steps left (south?), but moving forward would be west. Wait, facing west, forward is west. The wall is 3 steps forward (west), so moving forward isn't possible. 

Hmm, maybe the agent is facing a direction where turning left or right allows movement. 

Wait, another approach: The key is 3 steps right and 2 steps forward. So from the agent's current position, relative to the key, the agent needs to move in a direction that combines right and forward. 

If the agent turns right (east), then moves forward 2 steps (but there's a wall 3 steps forward east), so that's blocked. 

If the agent turns left (west), then moves forward 2 steps (west), but the wall is 3 steps forward (west), so again blocked. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to go around the wall by moving in a different direction. For example, turn right (east), then turn right again (south), then move forward 2 steps. Then turn right (west), and move 3 steps to reach the key. But this requires multiple actions. 

But in the current step, the agent can only take one action. So the best immediate action is to turn around to face a direction where movement is possible. 

Looking at the current observation, the agent must choose between turning left, right, going forward (blocked by wall), toggling (nothing to toggle), picking up (already holding the ball), or dropping (doesn't make sense here). 

Since moving forward is blocked, the options are turn left or turn right. Let's see: 

If the agent turns right, facing east. The key is 3 steps right (south) and 2 steps forward (east). So from east-facing, moving forward 2 steps (east) would reach the forward position of the key, then need to turn south (which would be a left turn) and move 3 steps. But that requires more actions. 

Alternatively, turning left (west), the key is 3 steps right (north) and 2 steps forward (west). From west-facing, moving forward 2 steps (west) would hit the wall. So that's not helpful. 

Hmm. Maybe the agent is facing south. Wait, but how? Let's consider possible directions. 

Alternatively, the agent could be facing north, and the key is to the east and north. But with a wall east, that's blocked. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to toggle something, but there's no object in front. The observation lists the key, ball, and walls. 

Wait, the key is in front, but the agent needs to approach it. Since moving forward is blocked by a wall, the agent must adjust direction. 

Perhaps the correct action is to turn right to face east, then turn right again to face south, then move forward 2 steps. But since only one action can be taken now, the immediate action is to turn right. 

But turning right once would face east, and moving forward isn't possible. So the agent needs to turn around. Maybe turn left twice? Wait, turning left twice would face south. 

Alternatively, the agent could turn left once (west), then turn right (south). But again, this requires multiple actions. 

Given the current constraints, the only viable action is to turn either left or right, as moving forward is blocked. Turning right might allow a different path in the next steps. 

So the chosen action is to turn right.

13,turn right,"<reasoning>
Let's break down the current observation. The agent is carrying the yellow ball, which means the first part of the mission (picking up the ball) is done. Now, the goal is to go to the green key.

Looking at the current setup, the green key is located 2 steps left and 3 steps forward. The agent's current position isn't specified, but based on the walls, I can infer direction. There's a wall 4 steps forward and another 3 steps left. That probably means the agent is facing a direction where forward is blocked by a wall, and to the left, there's also a wall. 

The green key is to the left and forward. Since there's a wall 3 steps left, the agent can't go straight left. So, to reach the key, the agent needs to adjust its direction. The key is 2 steps left and 3 steps forward. If the agent turns right, maybe that opens up a path towards the key's location. 

Wait, the previous actions had the agent turning left and right to navigate around walls. Let me check the history. Earlier, after picking up the ball, the agent turned left, then right, and left again to adjust direction. Now, with the key 2 steps left and 3 forward, perhaps turning right would realign the agent's path. If the agent turns right, then moves forward, maybe they can approach the key without hitting the walls. 

Alternatively, if the agent is facing a direction where left is blocked, turning right might open up a corridor. Let's visualize: if facing north, a wall to the left (west) and forward (north), turning right would face east. Then moving forward might lead towards the key's position. But the key is 2 left and 3 forward from the current position. If turning right, moving forward three steps would get closer, but then how to adjust left? Maybe after turning right and moving forward, the agent can then turn left again. 

Wait, but the key's position is 2 left and 3 forward. If the agent turns right (east), then moving forward 3 steps would take them 3 east, but the key is 2 west (left from the original position) and 3 north (forward). So maybe the agent needs to first turn right to face east, move forward some steps, then turn north? But the observations don't mention directions like north, so perhaps it's relative. 

Alternatively, the agent needs to go left and forward. Since directly left is blocked, turning right might allow a different path. Let's think step by step. Current position: walls 4 forward and 3 left. Green key is 2 left and 3 forward. If the agent turns right, their new forward direction would be east. From there, moving forward might reduce the distance to the key's forward component. Then, after moving, perhaps turn left to face west and move left to reach the key. 

But how does that align with the key's position? Let's say the agent is at point A, facing north. Walls to the left (west) and 4 steps north. The key is at point B, which is 2 west and 3 north from A. To get there, the agent can't go west directly because of the wall. So turning right (east) and moving forward 3 steps would take them to a point C, 3 east from A. Then, from C, turning left (north) isn't possible because the wall is 4 steps forward from A, which is now east from C. Wait, maybe not. This is getting confusing. 

Alternatively, after turning right, the agent's forward direction is east. The key is 2 west and 3 north from the original position. If the agent moves east, that would take them away from the west direction needed for the key. Hmm. Maybe the agent should first turn left twice to face south? But there's a wall 3 steps left (west), so turning left (west) isn't possible. Wait, no. The walls are 3 steps left and 4 steps forward. If the agent is facing north, left is west (blocked), forward is north (blocked). To reach the key at 2 west and 3 north, the agent needs to go west twice and north three times. But west is blocked. So perhaps the agent needs to find a path around the walls. 

Wait, the previous observations showed that after picking up the ball, the agent turned left, right, left again, and then moved forward. Maybe now the agent needs to adjust direction again. The current observation says the green key is 2 steps left and 3 steps forward. If the agent turns left again, facing west, but there's a wall 3 steps left (west). So that's blocked. Turning right (east) might allow moving forward towards the key's forward component. 

Alternatively, the agent could toggle something, but there's no objects in front except walls. The only interaction needed is to pick up the ball and then reach the green key. Since the agent is already holding the ball, the only action needed is to navigate to the key. 

So the best action would be to turn right to align towards a direction that allows approaching the key's position without hitting the walls. Then move forward step by step. 

In the last observation, after turning right, the green key is 3 steps left and 3 steps forward. But now, in the current observation, the key is 2 steps left and 3 steps forward. So maybe turning right again isn't the solution. Wait, the current observation shows the green key is 2 steps left and 3 steps forward, with walls 4 steps forward and 3 steps left. 

If the agent turns right, their new forward direction is east. The key's position relative to the agent would then be 2 steps left (west) and 3 steps forward (north). But from the agent's new position facing east, moving forward would take them east, which doesn't help with the west direction needed for the key. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent should turn around. If they turn left twice (180 degrees), facing south, but there's a wall 4 steps forward (which was originally north). If they face south, moving forward might lead them away from the key. 

This is tricky. Another approach: since the key is 2 steps left and 3 forward, and there's a wall 3 steps left, the agent can't go straight left. So they need to adjust their direction to approach the key diagonally or in a different path. 

Perhaps the agent should turn right, move forward a few steps, then turn left to face a direction that aligns with the key's position. For example, turn right (east), move forward until the wall is no longer in the way, then turn left (north) and move towards the key. 

But in the current observation, moving forward is blocked by a wall 4 steps ahead. So the agent can't just move straight forward. Therefore, the only safe moves are to turn left or right. 

Turning right might open up a path where the agent can move forward towards the key's forward component. Let's say the agent turns right (east), now their forward direction is east. The green key is 2 west and 3 north from the original position. From the new position, moving east won't help with the west direction. Alternatively, moving north would require turning north, but there's a wall 4 steps forward in the original direction. 

Wait, maybe the agent needs to first turn right, then move forward until they can turn left towards the key. But given the walls, this might not be possible. 

Alternatively, the agent could try to go around the wall. Since there's a wall 3 steps left, turning right (east) and moving forward might allow them to navigate around the wall. For example, turn right, move forward until the wall is behind, then turn left (north) and move towards the key. 

But in the current observation, moving forward is blocked by a wall 4 steps ahead. So the agent can't move forward in their current direction. Therefore, the only possible actions are to turn left or right. 

Given that, the best action is to turn right to face a direction where moving forward might not hit the wall immediately, and then proceed step by step. 

So the chosen action should be to turn right.

Let's try to figure out the next move. The goal is to pick up the yellow ball (which I already did) and then go to the green key. The current observation shows I'm carrying the yellow ball, and there's a wall 4 steps forward and another wall 3 steps to the right.

Looking around, the green key's position isn't mentioned in the current observation. Wait, maybe the previous observations had it. Let me check the history. Previously, the green key was at various positions like 3 steps left and 3 steps forward, then 2 steps left and 3 steps forward, and now in the last observation before this one, it was 2 steps left and 3 steps forward. But the current observation doesn't list the green key. Hmm, maybe the key was picked up already? No, the user hasn't mentioned that. Wait, in the last few steps, the assistant was trying to reach the green key, but maybe the key is now in the agent's inventory?

Wait, no. The agent's goal is first to pick up the yellow ball, which they did. Then go to the green key. So after picking up the yellow ball, the next step is to navigate to the green key. But in the current observation, the green key isn't listed. That's confusing. Maybe it's because the agent is facing a different direction now. Let me see the previous actions. The last action was turn right, which might have changed the agent's facing direction, making the green key's position not visible in the current observation.

The current observation lists walls in front and to the right, but no green key. So perhaps the agent needs to turn to face a different direction where the green key is now located. Since the agent was trying to get to the green key before, maybe they need to adjust their heading. Let's think: the agent is carrying the ball, so the next action should be to navigate towards where the green key was last seen. But since the current observation doesn't show it, the agent might need to turn left or right to reorient.

In the previous steps, after picking up the yellow ball, the agent turned left, then right, then left again, possibly trying to reposition. The latest observation before this current one had the green key at 2 steps left and 3 steps forward. So maybe the agent needs to turn left to face that direction. Alternatively, since there's a wall 4 steps forward now, the agent might need to go around by turning right or left to find a path towards where the key was.

Wait, the current observation has walls 4 steps forward and 3 steps right. So the agent is facing a wall in front and to the right. The possible directions to move would be backward, left, or maybe some other direction. But the agent needs to reach the green key. Since the key's position isn't visible here, the agent must have turned in a way that it's no longer in sight. The agent should turn left or right to reorient. Let's say the agent turned right earlier, so now facing a different direction where the key's position is to the left and forward.

If the agent turns left, that might align them to face the direction where the green key was previously located. Alternatively, if they need to go forward but there's a wall, turning left or right to find a path. But since the key's position isn't in the current observation, the agent needs to deduce its location based on prior movements.

Alternatively, maybe the agent should move backward to reposition. But moving backward might not be useful here. The best action might be to turn left to change direction and possibly see the green key again. Since the agent needs to go to the green key, turning left could help reorient towards it. Alternatively, turning right again, but that might face another wall. Let me check the previous steps.

In the recent observations, after picking up the ball, the agent turned left, then right, left again, leading to failed actions. Then the default was go forward, but that didn't work. Now the green key's position isn't visible. The agent must have missed it because of their orientation. So turning left or right to face a different direction where the key might be. Let's assume that the green key is to the left and forward. So the agent should turn left to face that direction. Then move forward when possible.

Given the current walls, turning left might open up a path. The current observation has a wall 3 steps left, so turning left would face a wall, but perhaps moving forward in that direction. Alternatively, turning right might face another wall. Wait, the current walls are 4 steps forward and 3 steps right. So if the agent turns left, their new forward direction would have a wall 3 steps left (from the current observation). Wait, no—the walls are relative to the agent's current direction. This is getting a bit confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the agent should toggle something, but there's no object in front. The only possible actions are turn left, turn right, go forward (but there's a wall), pick up (already holding the ball), drop (not needed yet), or toggle (no object). So the valid actions are turn left, turn right, or go forward (but blocked). Since go forward is blocked, the agent must turn. The best choice is to turn left or right to change direction. Since the green key was previously to the left and forward, turning left might align the agent to face that direction again. Alternatively, turning right might not. So the best action is turn left.

The agent needs to pick up the yellow ball first, which it already has. Now the goal is to go to the green key. Let me check the current observation.

The agent is carrying the yellow ball. There's a wall 4 steps forward, a wall 3 steps left, and the green key is 2 steps left and 3 steps forward. Hmm. So the key is diagonally left and forward. The agent's current direction must be such that going left would align it towards the key. But there's a wall 3 steps left, so maybe the agent is facing a direction where left is blocked. Wait, the observations mention walls in certain directions relative to the agent's current facing.

The agent needs to navigate to the green key. The key is 2 steps left and 3 steps forward. So if the agent turns left, that might face them towards the left direction. But there's a wall 3 steps left, so turning left might not be the right approach. Wait, the wall is 3 steps left from the agent's current position. So if the agent turns left, then moving forward 3 steps would hit a wall. But the key is only 2 steps left and 3 steps forward. So maybe after turning left, the agent can move forward 3 steps, but the path is blocked by a wall at 3 steps left. Wait, perhaps the agent needs to adjust their direction differently.

Alternatively, if the agent turns right instead. The wall is 3 steps right, so turning right and moving forward might not help. Let's think again. The key is 2 steps left and 3 steps forward. So from the agent's current position, if they turn left, their left direction would be where the key is. But moving left 2 steps and forward 3 might require a combination of turning and moving. Wait, perhaps the agent should first turn left to face the direction where the key is located. Then, move forward 3 steps, but the wall is 3 steps left. Wait, the observation says a wall 3 steps left. So if the agent is facing north, then left would be west. If there's a wall 3 steps west, but the key is 2 steps west and 3 steps north. So the agent can turn left (west), then move forward 3 steps north? But the wall is 3 steps west. Wait, maybe the agent's current facing is such that turning left makes their forward direction align with north. Then moving forward 3 steps would hit a wall, but the key is 3 steps forward and 2 steps left. Wait, perhaps the agent needs to go forward 3 steps first, then turn left? But there's a wall 4 steps forward, so moving forward 3 steps would hit a wall. That's not possible.

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to adjust their direction first. Since the key is 2 left and 3 forward, perhaps the agent should turn left to face the direction where the left is towards the key's position. Then move forward 3 steps, but the wall is 3 steps left. Wait, maybe the key is 2 steps left and 3 steps forward from the agent's current position. So if the agent turns left (so their left direction is now their forward?), no, turning left changes their facing. Let me visualize this.

Let's assume the agent is facing east. The wall is 3 steps left (which would be north), 4 steps forward (which is east), and 3 steps right (south). The key is 2 steps left (north) and 3 steps forward (east). Wait, that can't be. If the agent is facing east, then left is north, right is south. The key is 2 steps left (north) and 3 steps forward (east). So the key is 2 north and 3 east from the agent's position. But in that case, the agent would need to go north 2 and east 3. But the agent can only move in the directions they are facing. So if the agent is facing east, they can move forward (east) but there's a wall 4 steps forward, so they can't go past that. So maybe the agent needs to turn north first. Wait, turning left twice would make the agent face north. Then moving forward 2 steps and then east 3? But they can't move diagonally. Each move is straight.

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to turn left (north), move forward 2 steps (since the key is 2 steps north), then turn east (right turn from north would be east), then move forward 3 steps. But moving forward 3 steps east would hit a wall 4 steps forward (which was originally east when facing east). Wait, but the agent's forward direction changes when they turn. So if the agent turns left (north), then their forward direction is north, and the wall 4 steps forward would be north. But the key is 2 steps north and 3 steps east. So after moving north 2 steps, the agent is at the key's north position, then needs to move east 3. But how?

This is getting complicated. Let's look at the current observation again. The agent is carrying the yellow ball. Walls: 3 steps forward (which direction?), 3 steps left, and green key is 2 steps left and 3 steps forward. Wait, perhaps the agent's current facing is such that forward is south. Because if the wall is 3 steps forward (south), then left would be west, right east. The key is 2 steps left (west) and 3 steps forward (south). So the key is southwest of the agent. But the agent needs to get to the green key. So the agent would need to turn west (left turn) and move forward, but the wall is 3 steps left (west). Wait, the observation says a wall 3 steps left. If left is west, then moving west 3 steps would hit a wall. But the key is only 2 steps west and 3 steps south. So perhaps the agent can't go directly west. Maybe they need to go south first? But there's a wall 3 steps forward (south). So the agent can't move forward into the wall. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the agent is facing north. Then forward is north, left is west, right is east. The wall is 3 steps forward (north), 3 steps left (west), and the key is 2 steps left (west) and 3 steps forward (north). Wait, that would place the key 2 west and 3 north, which is northwest of the agent. But the agent can't move north because there's a wall 3 steps forward. So this doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, maybe the agent is facing south. Then forward is south, left is east, right is west. The wall is 3 steps forward (south), 3 steps left (east), and the key is 2 steps left (east) and 3 steps forward (south). So the key is east 2 and south 3. But the agent can't move south because of the wall. This is confusing. The problem is that the agent's current facing direction isn't specified in the observation. The observations only describe what's in certain directions relative to the agent's current orientation, but not which direction that is. So the agent has to figure out their orientation based on previous actions.

Looking back at the action history. Initially, the agent turned right, then left, went forward several times, etc. Let's try to reconstruct the agent's path.

First observation: yellow ball 3 steps right and 1 forward. Agent turned right. Then next observation: yellow ball 1 left, 3 forward. Then agent turned left. Then went forward thrice, each time getting closer. Then picked up the ball. After that, the agent was trying to navigate to the green key. For example, after picking up the ball, in one observation, the green key was 3 left and 3 forward. The agent turned left, then right, etc. It's possible that the agent is now facing a direction where forward is north, and left is west, right is east.

In the current observation, the key is 2 steps left and 3 steps forward. If left is west and forward is north, then the key is 2 west and 3 north. But the agent's current position is such that moving north 3 steps would hit a wall (forward wall is 3 steps). So the agent can't go north. Therefore, they need to find another path. Perhaps they need to go west first, but the wall is 3 steps left (west), so moving west 3 steps is blocked. But the key is only 2 west. So maybe the agent can move west 2 steps, then north 3? But how to get there.

Wait, if the agent turns left (west), then they can move forward 2 steps to reach the key's west position. Then, from there, turn north (another left turn) and move forward 3 steps. But moving forward 3 steps north would hit the wall. So that's not possible. Alternatively, after moving west 2 steps, turn north and move 3 steps, but the wall is 3 steps forward (north) from the original position. So from the new position (after moving west 2), moving north 3 would still hit the wall. So that's no good.

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to go south first. But there's a wall 3 steps forward (north). So moving south isn't possible. Wait, no, forward is north, so moving forward would be north. If the agent turns around, maybe. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to turn right (east), then move forward, but there's a wall 3 steps right (east). So moving east is blocked. Hmm.

This is getting a bit stuck. Maybe the agent needs to adjust their direction again. Let's look at the current observation:

You carry a yellow ball
a wall 3 steps forward
a wall 3 steps left
a green key 2 steps left and 3 steps forward

Assuming that left is west and forward is north, the key is west 2 and north 3. The agent can't move north because of the wall. So perhaps the agent needs to go west first, but the wall is 3 steps left (west), but the key is only 2 steps west. So maybe the agent can move west 2 steps, but how? If the agent turns left (west), then moves forward 2 steps, they would reach the key's west position. Then, from there, the agent needs to move north 3, but there's a wall 3 steps forward (north) from the original position. So even if the agent is now 2 steps west, moving north 3 would still be 3 steps from their new position, which is against the wall. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to move south first. But moving south would be the opposite direction of forward (north). So turning around (180 degrees) to face south. Then moving forward south. But the original wall was 3 steps forward (north), which would now be 3 steps back (south). So moving south 3 steps would take the agent past the original position. Then, from there, turn left (which would be west) and move forward 2 steps, then turn north (another left) and move forward 3 steps? But this seems complicated and the observations don't mention anything about being able to move south past the wall. Wait, the initial observations had walls in certain directions, but perhaps after moving forward, the walls might change? No, the walls are static.

This is tricky. Maybe the agent needs to try a different approach. Since they can't move north due to the wall, perhaps they need to go around the wall. For example, turn right (east), move forward until they can turn north. But there's a wall 3 steps right (east), so moving east is blocked. Alternatively, turn left (west), move forward 2 steps to the key's position, then turn south (right turn) and move forward. But the key is at 2 west and 3 north. So after moving west 2, the agent is at the key's east position. Then turning south and moving forward would take them south, but where is the key? The key is at that position, so once the agent is at 2 west, they can just toggle or pick up the key. Wait, but the key is 2 left and 3 forward from the agent's current position. So when the agent is at the key's location, they can toggle it to pick it up. But how to get there.

Wait, the agent is currently facing north, with a wall 3 steps north. The key is 2 steps west (left) and 3 steps north (forward). So the key is diagonally northwest. To reach it, the agent needs to go west 2 and north 3, but can't go north. So maybe the agent needs to go west 2 first, then north 3. But can't go north. Alternatively, find a path around. But the walls are in place.

Alternatively, maybe the agent made a mistake in previous steps and needs to adjust direction again. Looking at the previous actions, the agent turned left, right, left, etc., trying to navigate. Maybe now they need to turn right to face a different direction. For example, current observation has walls 3 forward and 3 left. If the agent turns right, their new forward direction is east, and left is north. The key is 2 left (north) and 3 forward (east). So if the agent turns right (now facing east), then moves forward 3 steps (east), but there's a wall 3 steps right (which was previously south, but after turning right, right is south). Wait, this is getting too confusing without knowing the exact facing direction.

Alternatively, the agent can try to move forward, but there's a wall 3 steps forward. So moving forward isn't possible. The agent needs to turn in a direction that allows them to approach the key without hitting the wall. Since the key is 2 left and 3 forward, perhaps turning left (west) and moving forward 3 steps would get them to the key's position. But there's a wall 3 steps left (west), which would mean moving west 3 steps is blocked, but the key is only 2 steps west. Wait, maybe the wall is 3 steps in the left direction, which is west, so moving west 3 steps is blocked, but the key is at west 2, forward 3. So if the agent turns left (west), moves forward 2 steps, then turns north (another left) and moves forward 3 steps. But moving north 3 steps would hit the wall. Hmm.

Alternatively, after moving west 2 steps, turn south (right) and move forward. But the key is at that position. Wait, the key is 2 steps left and 3 steps forward from the agent's current position. If the agent turns left (west) and moves 2 steps, they're at the key's west position. Then, their forward direction is still north, but they need to move north 3 steps, which is blocked. So perhaps they need to pick up the key while they're adjacent. But how to get adjacent. The key is 2 steps left and 3 forward. So when the agent is 1 step left and 2 forward, they can toggle it. But how to reach that position.

This is really challenging without knowing the agent's exact orientation. Maybe the correct action here is to turn left again, aligning with the key's position, and then move forward until reaching the key. But given the walls, this might not work. Alternatively, the agent needs to turn right and find a different path.

Looking at the current observation: walls 3 steps forward and 3 left, key 2 left and 3 forward. If the agent turns left, their left direction is west, forward is north. Moving forward 3 steps would hit the wall. So turning left and moving isn't helpful. Turning right, their forward is east, left is north. The key is 2 left (north) and 3 forward (east). So if the agent turns right, then moves forward 3 steps east, but there's a wall 3 steps right (which was south before, but after turning right, right is south). Wait, perhaps moving forward 3 steps east would take them past the wall. No, the wall is 3 steps forward in their current direction, which is now east. So moving east 3 steps would hit the wall. Not possible.

So the only possible action that doesn't hit a wall is to turn left or right, but both seem blocked. Wait, no. The agent can't move forward, but they can turn. Turning left or right doesn't change the wall positions, just their facing. So perhaps the agent needs to try a different sequence. For example, turn left, then move forward 2 steps (to the key's west position), then turn north and move forward. But moving north would hit the wall. Alternatively, after moving west 2, turn south and move forward. But that would take them away from the key.

Alternatively, maybe the agent made a mistake in previous steps and needs to adjust. Looking back, after picking up the ball, the agent was trying to navigate to the key. In one step, the green key was 3 steps left and 3 forward. The agent turned left, then right, etc. Maybe now the agent should turn right to face east, then move forward until they can turn north. But the wall is 3 steps east (right), so moving east isn't possible.

This is really confusing. The key must be reachable, so perhaps there's a path the agent hasn't considered. Let's think differently. The agent needs to get to the green key which is 2 left and 3 forward. If the agent turns left (west), moves forward 2 steps, then turns north (another left) and moves forward 3 steps. But moving north 3 steps would hit the wall. So maybe after turning left twice (facing north), the agent can't move forward. Alternatively, turn left once (west), move 2 steps, then turn east (right) and move forward 3 steps. But that would take them east 3 steps from the key's position, which is not helpful.

Wait, perhaps the agent needs to go around the wall. The wall is 3 steps forward (north), so if the agent turns right (east) and moves forward, but there's a wall 3 steps right (east), so that's blocked. Alternatively, turn around (180 degrees) to face south, then move forward until they can go west. But moving south past the wall is not possible. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the agent can drop the yellow ball somewhere to free up space, but the goal is to pick up the yellow ball first, then go to the green key. Dropping the ball now would be counterproductive.

At this point, the only possible actions that don't hit walls are turning left or right. Since moving forward is blocked, the agent must turn to a different direction. However, turning left or right doesn't change the fact that moving forward is blocked. Wait, no—the walls are","

Let's see. The goal is to pick up the yellow ball first, which I already did. Now, I need to go to the green key. Let me check the current observation again.

The observation says I'm carrying the yellow ball. There's a wall 3 steps forward, a wall 3 steps left, and the green key is 2 steps left and 2 steps forward. 

Hmm, I need to navigate to the green key. Since there's a wall blocking forward, I can't go straight. I should probably turn to face the direction of the key. Let me see the relative positions. The key is 2 steps left and 2 steps forward. If I'm facing a direction where left is towards where the key is, then turning left might align me better. But wait, my current orientation isn't clear from the observation. The walls are 3 steps left and forward, but I don't know which way I'm facing. 

Wait, maybe I need to adjust my direction. If the key is 2 steps left and 2 forward, maybe I should turn left to face the key's direction. Alternatively, maybe turn right and then adjust. 

Alternatively, since there's a wall 3 steps forward, maybe I should turn left to face a direction where the key is. Let me think: if I turn left, then my forward direction would be where the left wall is now, but the key is 2 steps left and 2 forward. If I turn left, then moving forward would take me towards the key's direction. Wait, but the key is 2 steps left (from my current position) and 2 steps forward. So if I turn left, my left is now forward? No, turning left changes my orientation. Let me visualize this. 

Assuming my current facing direction: Let's say I'm facing north. The wall is 3 steps forward (north), 3 steps left (west). The key is 2 steps left (west) and 2 steps forward (north). So the key is diagonally north-west from my current position. To get there, I need to go west and north. But there's a wall directly north (3 steps forward). So I can't go straight north. Therefore, I need to turn west (left) and then go forward, but wait, the key is 2 steps west and 2 north. If I turn west (left), then moving forward would take me west, but the key is also north from there. Hmm, maybe I need to adjust. 

Alternatively, if I turn right, facing east. Then the wall is 3 steps east (right), and the key is 2 steps west and 2 north. That doesn't seem helpful. 

Wait, maybe the key's position is relative to my current position. Let me parse the observation again: the green key is 3 steps left and 3 steps forward from my previous position. Wait, no, the latest observation after moving says the green key is 2 steps left and 2 steps forward. So from my current position, facing whatever direction I'm facing, the key is to my left and a bit forward. 

So if the key is to my left and slightly forward, perhaps I need to turn left to face directly towards it. Then move forward. But before moving, I need to check if there's a wall in the way. The observation says a wall is 3 steps forward, but that might be in my current facing direction. Wait, no, the walls are in the directions relative to my current orientation. Wait, the observation lists walls in specific directions. For example, ""a wall 3 steps forward"" means in the direction I'm currently facing. ""A wall 3 steps left"" is to my left. 

So if the key is 2 steps left and 2 steps forward, that means from my current position, if I turn left (so my left becomes forward), then moving forward 2 steps would get me to the key. But first, I need to turn left to face that direction. 

Let me confirm: If I turn left, then my forward direction is now where my previous left was. So the key is 2 steps in that new forward direction and 0 steps left (since the original left is now forward). Wait, no. The key's position is relative to my current orientation. So if I turn left, the key's position changes based on my new orientation. 

This is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to model it. 

Current position: Let's assume I'm at coordinates (0,0). Facing north. Walls: 3 steps north (forward), 3 steps west (left). Green key is 2 steps west (left) and 2 steps north (forward) from here. So the key is at (-2, 2). 

But I can't go north because there's a wall. So I need to reach (-2,2). How? 

If I turn left (west), then my forward direction is west. Moving forward 2 steps would take me to (-2,0), then another step forward would hit the wall (since there's a wall 3 steps forward in the original direction, which is now west). Wait, the wall was 3 steps forward originally (north), but after turning left, forward is west. The observation doesn't mention a wall in the new forward direction. Wait, the current observation says a wall 3 steps forward and a wall 3 steps left. Wait, after turning left, the forward direction is west, and left would be south. But the observation still lists walls 3 steps forward (west) and 3 steps left (south). But the green key is at (-2,2). 

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust my direction. Let me think again. If I'm facing north, and the key is 2 west and 2 north, but north is blocked. So I need to go west first, then north. But going west directly would face a wall? No, the wall is 3 steps forward (north). So if I turn left (west), then move forward, there's no wall mentioned in that direction. Wait, in the current observation after moving, the walls are 3 steps forward (which would be west now) and 3 steps left (south). But the green key is 2 steps left (south) and 2 steps forward (west). That doesn't align. 

Wait, perhaps my previous steps caused the observation to change. Let's recap the previous actions and observations:

After picking up the ball, the agent turned left, right, left, right, left, etc., trying to navigate. The latest observation before this one had the green key at 3 steps left and 3 steps forward. Then after some moves, the key is now 2 steps left and 2 steps forward. 

Assuming that the agent is now facing a direction where left is south and forward is west. The key is 2 steps left (south) and 2 steps forward (west). But there's a wall 3 steps forward (west) and 3 steps left (south). Wait, that can't be. If the wall is 3 steps forward (west), then moving west 3 steps would hit a wall. But the key is 2 steps west and 2 steps south. Hmm, maybe the coordinates are different. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent is facing east now. Let me try a different approach. 

The key is 2 steps left and 2 steps forward. So regardless of direction, the agent needs to move in the left and forward direction. But since there's a wall 3 steps forward, the agent can't go straight forward. Therefore, the agent must turn left to face a direction where moving forward will get closer to the key. 

If turning left makes the agent face a direction where the key is 2 steps forward and 0 steps left, then moving forward twice would reach the key. But how does that align with the observation? 

Alternatively, if the agent turns right, then forward might be a direction where the key is 2 steps left and 2 steps forward. No, that doesn't make sense. 

Perhaps the correct action is to turn left, aligning the agent to face the direction where the key is 2 steps forward and 0 steps left (since turning left changes the left direction to forward). Wait, the key's position is 2 steps left and 2 steps forward. If the agent turns left, then their left becomes forward. So the key's position relative to the new orientation would be 2 steps in the new left direction (which was the original forward) and 2 steps forward (new forward, which was original left). This is getting too confusing. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to turn left once to face the correct direction and then move forward twice. Let's try that. The previous observation after moving forward a couple times had the key at 2 steps left and 2 forward. So if the agent turns left, then moves forward twice, they should reach the key. 

But wait, the agent's current observation after the last move is: walls 3 steps forward, 3 steps left, green key 2 left and 2 forward. So if the agent turns left, their forward direction is now where the left was before. Moving forward twice would get them to the key's position. 

Alternatively, maybe after turning left, the key is 2 steps forward and 2 steps left (relative to new orientation). Then moving forward twice and then turning left again to face the key. 

This is tricky. Let me think step by step. 

Current state: carrying the yellow ball. Walls are 3 steps forward and 3 steps left. Key is 2 left and 2 forward. 

Possible actions: turn left, turn right, go forward, pick up (can't pick up again), drop (don't need to), toggle (maybe toggle the key? But the key is an object, not something to toggle. Toggle is for interacting with objects in front, like doors maybe. 

So the goal is to reach the green key. Since the key is 2 left and 2 forward, the agent needs to adjust their direction to face towards the key. Since there's a wall 3 steps forward, the agent can't go straight. So the best bet is to turn left or right to face a direction where moving forward gets closer to the key. 

If the agent turns left, their new forward direction is where the left was before. The key is 2 steps in the original left direction (which is now forward) and 2 steps original forward (which is new left). So after turning left, the key is 2 steps forward and 2 steps left. To reach it, the agent needs to move forward twice, then turn left again to face the key and toggle it? 

But the key is an object, so once in front of it, the agent can toggle to pick it up. 

Alternatively, maybe after turning left, the agent moves forward twice, then the key is directly in front, and they can toggle. 

But let's check the distances. If the agent turns left, the key is 2 steps forward (new direction) and 2 steps left (original direction, now new left). So moving forward twice would get them to the key's position. Then they can toggle to pick up the key. 

Yes, that makes sense. 

So the steps would be: turn left, go forward twice, toggle. 

But in the current observation, after the last move, the key is 2 left and 2 forward. So the agent needs to turn left to face the direction where the key is 2 forward and 2 left. Wait, no. Turning left changes the agent's orientation. Let me clarify:

Original orientation (assuming facing north):

- Forward: north
- Left: west
- Right: east

Key is 2 west (left) and 2 north (forward). 

If the agent turns left (now facing west):

- Forward: west
- Left: south
- Right: north

The key's position relative to the new orientation:

- Original west is now forward.
- Original north is now right.

So the key is 2 steps forward (west) and 2 steps right (north). 

So to reach the key, the agent would need to move forward twice (to west 2 steps), then turn right (facing north), and move forward 2 steps. But there's a wall 3 steps forward (west) in the current observation. Wait, no—the current observation after moving has walls 3 steps forward (west) and 3 steps left (south). Wait, this is conflicting. If the agent turned left, their forward is west, and the wall is 3 steps west. But the key is 2 steps west. So moving forward twice would reach the key, and then they can toggle. 

But why does the observation say there's a wall 3 steps forward? Because in the current observation, after previous moves, the walls are 3 steps forward and 3 steps left. So if the agent turns left, their forward is west, and left is south. The wall is 3 steps west (forward), and 3 steps south (left). The key is 2 steps west (forward) and 2 steps north (right). 

So moving forward twice would get the agent to the key's position (west 2 steps), then they need to turn right (to face north) and move forward 2 steps. But moving forward from there would hit the wall? Because the wall is 3 steps north in the original orientation, which is now the right direction. 

Wait, after turning left, facing west, moving forward twice gets to west 2. Then turning right (now facing north), the wall is 3 steps north (original direction). So moving forward 2 steps from west 2, north 0 would be to west 2, north 2. But the key is at west 2, north 2. So that's the key's position. 

But in this case, the agent would be at the key's location after moving forward twice when facing west, then turning right and moving forward twice. But the key is already at west 2, so after moving forward twice when facing west, the agent is at the key's position. Then they can toggle to pick it up. 

So the correct actions would be: turn left, go forward twice, toggle. 

But in the current observation, the agent is told that after moving forward, the green key is 2 steps left and 2 steps forward. So perhaps the agent needs to adjust their direction again. 

Wait, maybe the agent is now facing a different direction. Let's track the previous actions:

Initial actions after picking up the ball:

1. turn left
2. turn left
3. go forward
4. turn right
5. go forward
6. go forward
7. go forward
8. pick up
9. turn left
10. turn right
11. turn left
12. turn right
13. turn left
14. go forward (default after previous failure)
15. Observation: walls 3 steps forward, 3 left, key 2 left and 2 forward.

So after step 14 (go forward), the observation shows the key at 2 left and 2 forward. 

Assuming that after turning left multiple times, the agent's orientation is such that left is now south and forward is west. 

So the key is 2 steps south (left) and 2 steps west (forward). 

To get to the key, the agent needs to move southwest. But they can't go straight west because there's a wall 3 steps forward (west). 

So the agent should turn left again to face south, then move forward 2 steps, then turn west (right), but that might not be necessary. 

Alternatively, if the agent turns right (east), then forward would be east, which is not helpful. 

Alternatively, the agent can turn left (south), move forward 2 steps to reach the key's position (since the key is 2 steps south and 2 steps west). Wait, no. If the agent is facing south, moving forward 2 steps would take them 2 south, but the key is 2 south and 2 west. So they still need to go west. 

This is getting too convoluted. Maybe the best action here is to turn left to face the direction where the key is 2 steps forward and 2 steps left, then move forward twice. 

But given the confusion in directions, perhaps the safest action is to turn left and then move forward. 

In the current observation, moving forward would hit a wall (3 steps forward). But the key is only 2 steps left and 2 forward. So turning left first to avoid the wall. 

So the correct action is to turn left, then move forward twice, then toggle. 

But the agent needs to do this step by step. 

The latest valid action before the default was ""turn left"", which resulted in the current observation. Now, the agent needs to decide the next action. 

In the current observation: walls 3 steps forward, 3 steps left, key 2 left and 2 forward. 

If the agent turns left again, their new forward is south. Moving forward 2 steps would take them to the key's location (2 south and 0 west). But the key is 2 south and 2 west. So that's not enough. 

Alternatively, after turning left, the agent can move forward 2 steps (to reach the wall at step 3), but the key is only 2 steps forward. Wait, the wall is 3 steps forward, so moving forward 2 steps would reach the key. 

Wait, if the agent turns left, their forward direction is south. The key is 2 steps left (west) and 2 steps forward (south). So to reach the key, the agent needs to move west and south. But they can't move west directly because turning left makes west their right. 

This is really confusing. Maybe the agent should try to turn right instead. 

If the agent turns right, their new forward direction is north. The wall is 3 steps north, so can't go there. The key is 2 steps left (west) and 2 steps forward (north). So if facing north, moving forward 2 steps would hit the wall. Then turn left (west) and move forward 2 steps. 

But the key is 2 west and 2 north, so that would place the agent at the key's location. 

So the steps would be: turn right, go forward 2 (can't, wall). So that's not possible. 

Hmm. Maybe the correct action is to turn left, move forward twice, then toggle. 

But in the current observation, moving forward would hit the wall (3 steps forward). Wait, no—the wall is 3 steps forward in the current direction. If the agent turns left, their forward direction is south, and the wall is 3 steps south (left in original direction). The key is 2 steps south (left) and 2 steps west (forward). 

So after turning left, moving forward 2 steps would take the agent to south 2, west 0. Then they need to move west 2 steps. But how? Their forward is south, right is west. So they can turn right (now facing west) and move forward 2 steps. 

So the actions would be:","

Your previous output did not contain a valid action. Defaulted to action: go forward

Observation:
You carry a yellow ball
a wall 2 steps forward
a wall 3 steps left
a green key 2 steps left and 1 step forward",0,False
17,turn left,"<reasoning>
Let's see. The goal is to first pick up the yellow ball, which I already did. Now I need to go to the green key. The observation says I'm carrying the yellow ball, there's a wall 2 steps forward, a wall 3 steps left, and the green key is 2 steps left and 1 step forward.

So, my current direction must be such that the green key is to the left and slightly forward. I need to figure out how to face towards the key. Since the key is 2 steps left and 1 forward, maybe I should turn left to face the key's direction. But wait, there's a wall 3 steps left. Does that mean if I turn left, there's a wall blocking that path? Hmm. Or maybe the wall is in another direction.

Wait, the walls are 2 steps forward and 3 steps left. So if I'm facing a direction where left is blocked by a wall, I might need to reorient. Let me think: to reach the green key which is 2 left and 1 forward, perhaps I need to face northeast or some direction. But given the walls, maybe I need to adjust my orientation first.

Looking at the previous actions, the agent tried turning left and right multiple times. The latest observation after going forward shows the green key is 2 left and 1 forward. Since the agent previously turned left and right to align, maybe now they need to turn right to face the key properly. Or maybe turn left again. Wait, the walls are 3 steps left and 2 steps forward. If I turn left, I would be facing a wall 3 steps away, which isn't helpful. Maybe I should turn right instead. Turning right would make the key's position relative to my new direction. Let me try to visualize:

If I'm facing north, then left is west. If there's a wall 3 steps west, turning right would face east. But the key is 2 west and 1 north. Wait, perhaps the agent is facing a direction where left is not towards the key. Maybe the agent needs to turn left to face the direction of the key. But there's a wall 3 steps left. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to go forward first. The key is 1 step forward and 2 left. If the agent goes forward 1 step, then they can turn left and go 2 steps. But there's a wall 2 steps forward. Wait, the current observation says a wall 2 steps forward. So going forward once would hit the wall. So that's not possible. Therefore, the agent can't move forward directly towards the key because there's a wall there.

So the path to the key is blocked by a wall when moving forward. Therefore, the agent needs to adjust direction. Since the key is 2 left and 1 forward, perhaps turning left would align the key to the left of the agent's new forward direction. Wait, if I turn left, then my forward direction becomes west (assuming original was north). The key is 2 west and 1 north. So from the new position, after turning left, the key would be 1 step north and 2 steps west. But the agent is already carrying the ball, so maybe toggle isn't needed here. The agent needs to navigate around the wall.

Alternatively, maybe the agent should turn right to face east. Then, moving forward would be east, but the wall is 2 steps forward (which was north before turning right). Wait, maybe I'm getting confused with directions. Let me clarify:

Assuming the agent's initial direction is north. Observations mention walls 5 steps forward initially, then after moving forward a few times, walls are in different positions. Now, the latest observation says walls are 2 steps forward and 3 steps left. If the agent is facing north, left is west. So a wall 3 steps west (left) and 2 steps north (forward). The green key is 2 steps west (left) and 1 step north (forward). So the key is directly to the northwest of the agent's current position, but there's a wall 2 steps forward (north) and a wall 3 steps left (west). Wait, that can't be. If the agent is facing north, then forward is north, left is west. So the key is 2 steps west and 1 step north. But the wall is 2 steps forward (north) and 3 steps left (west). So the agent is at a position where north is blocked by a wall after 2 steps, west is blocked after 3 steps. The key is 1 step north and 2 steps west. So to reach the key, the agent would have to go north 1 step (but there's a wall there) and west 2 steps. But the wall is 2 steps forward (north), so the first step north hits the wall. That's a problem.

Wait, maybe the agent's current position is such that the wall is 2 steps forward, meaning the next step north is a wall. But the key is 1 step forward (north) and 2 steps left (west). So if the agent could go north 1 step, but the wall is there. That's impossible. Therefore, there must be a different path. Maybe the agent needs to turn around. For example, turn right (east), then move forward, but there's a wall 4 steps forward in previous observations. Wait, in the latest observation, the wall is 2 steps forward. Wait, the current observation after previous default actions is: wall 2 steps forward, wall 3 steps left, green key 2 left and 1 forward.

Assuming the agent is facing north, left is west. So green key is 2 west and 1 north. Wall is 2 north and 3 west. So the agent is at position (0,0), key at (-2,1), wall at (0,2) and (-3,0). The agent can't go north because the wall is at (0,1) and (0,2). So to get to the key at (-2,1), the agent needs to go west 2 steps and north 1 step, but the north direction is blocked. Therefore, the only way is to go west first, but the wall is 3 steps west. So west 3 steps would hit the wall. But the key is west 2 steps. So maybe the agent can go west 2 steps, but how? If facing north, turning left (west), then moving forward 2 steps would reach the key. But the wall is 3 steps left (west), meaning that moving west 3 steps is blocked. But the key is at west 2 steps. So perhaps moving west 2 steps is possible. Wait, but the wall is 3 steps west. So the agent can move west 2 steps, which is before the wall. That would make sense. So the agent needs to turn left (face west), then move forward 2 steps to reach the key.

But in the current observation, the green key is 2 steps left and 1 step forward. If the agent turns left (west), then the key would be 2 steps forward (since left becomes forward when turning). Wait, maybe I'm mixing up directions. Let me reorient:

If the agent is facing north, then:

- Turning left (west) makes forward direction west.

- The green key is 2 steps left (west) and 1 step forward (north). So when facing north, the key is northwest. If the agent turns left (west), then their forward direction is west. The key would be 2 steps forward (west) and 1 step north (which would be their original left direction). So from the agent's new forward direction (west), the key is 2 steps forward and 1 step south (since north is now their right). Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the agent should turn right to face east. Then, moving forward would be east, but the wall is 2 steps forward (which was north before turning). Wait, no. If facing north, turning right makes forward direction east. The wall is 2 steps forward (north), which is still north of the agent. So turning right doesn't help with the wall blocking the north path.

The key is at 2 left and 1 forward from the agent's current position. So if the agent turns left (west), then their forward direction is west. The key is 2 steps forward (west) and 1 step north (which would be their left direction). So from the agent's perspective after turning left, the key is 2 steps forward and 1 step south. To reach it, the agent would need to move forward 2 steps (west) and then maybe turn north? But how?

Alternatively, the agent could turn around (180 degrees), facing south. Then, moving forward would be south, but the wall is 2 steps north. Not helpful. Maybe turn right twice (south), but that might not help.

Wait, maybe the agent needs to first move forward 1 step, but the wall is only 2 steps forward. Wait, in the current observation, the wall is 2 steps forward. So moving forward once would hit the wall. Therefore, the agent cannot move forward directly.

So the options are to turn left or right. If the agent turns left (west), then the green key is 2 steps forward (west) and 1 step north (which is the agent's original left direction). So if the agent turns left and moves forward 2 steps, they would reach the key's west position, but then need to go north 1 step. But moving north from there would be the agent's right direction (since they're facing west). So after turning left and moving west 2 steps, the agent would be at (-2, 0). Then, turning right (now facing north) and moving forward 1 step would reach (-2, 1), which is the key's position. But how does the agent know to do that? The agent needs to plan the path.

Alternatively, maybe the agent should turn left, move forward 2 steps to reach the key's west position, then pick up the key. But the key is 2 steps left and 1 forward from the current position. If the agent turns left (west), then the key is 2 steps forward (west) and 1 step north. So moving forward 2 steps would get to the key's west coordinate, then the agent needs to face north (turn right) and move forward 1 step to reach the key. But the agent can't see the key once they're west of it; they need to toggle it. Wait, the key is in front of them when they are facing west 2 steps? Or maybe when they are facing north again.

This is getting a bit confusing. Let's break it down step by step.

Current state: agent is carrying the yellow ball. The green key is 2 steps left and 1 step forward. Walls are 2 steps forward and 3 steps left.

Assuming the agent is facing north:

- Left is west.

- Forward is north.

Green key is 2 steps west (left) and 1 step north (forward).

So the key is at position (-2, 1) if the agent is at (0,0). The wall is 2 steps north (forward) at (0,1) and (0,2), and 3 steps west (left) at (-1,0), (-2,0), (-3,0).

To reach the key at (-2,1):

1. The agent needs to move west 2 steps and north 1 step.

But moving north 1 step is blocked by the wall at (0,1).

Therefore, the agent must find a way around the wall. Since the wall is only 2 steps north, maybe the agent can move west first, then north.

But how?

If the agent turns left (west), then their forward direction is west. Moving forward 2 steps would take them to (-2, 0), which is 2 steps west. From there, they need to move north 1 step. Since they're facing west, moving north would be their right direction. So they need to turn right (now facing north) and move forward 1 step to reach (-2, 1), which is the key's position.

So the sequence would be:

- Turn left (face west)

- Go forward 2 steps (to (-2, 0))

- Turn right (face north)

- Go forward 1 step (to (-2, 1))

- Pick up the green key (but the action is 'toggle' to interact with it)

Wait, but the key is in front of the agent when they are at (-2, 1), so 'toggle' would pick it up.

But the agent needs to execute these actions. However, in the current observation, the green key is 2 steps left and 1 forward. So if the agent turns left (west), then the key is 2 steps forward (west) and 1 step north. So moving forward 2 steps would reach the key's west position, then turning right and moving forward 1 step would reach the key. But how does the agent know to do that? The agent's previous actions were turning left and right, trying to align.

In the current observation, after the default action of 'go forward', the agent is facing a wall 2 steps forward and 3 steps left, with the green key 2 left and 1 forward.

The agent needs to decide between turning left or right. If turning left, they face west, then they can move forward 2 steps (since the wall is 3 steps left, which is 3 steps west, so moving 2 steps west is possible). Then turn right to face north and move forward 1 step to the key. Alternatively, turning right might not help because facing east would have walls further forward.

So the best action is to turn left, then go forward twice, then turn right and go forward once. But the agent can only take one action at a time. So first, the agent should turn left to face west. Then, go forward 2 steps. But the agent can only do one step at a time. Wait, the 'go forward' action takes one step. So in the current observation, after turning left, the agent can go forward once, then again, then turn right, then go forward once.

But in the current step, the agent needs to choose the next action based on the latest observation. The latest observation after the default 'go forward' is:

Observation:
You carry a yellow ball
a wall 2 steps forward
a wall 3 steps left
a green key 2 steps left and 1 step forward

So the agent needs to decide: turn left or right.

If the agent turns left (west), then their forward direction is west. The green key is 2 steps left (which would now be 2 steps forward) and 1 step forward (north). So from the agent's new perspective, the key is 2 steps forward and 1 step north. But how to reach it? The agent can move forward 2 steps (west) to get to the key's position, then turn north (right) and move forward 1 step. But since the agent can only do one action now, the first step is to turn left.

Alternatively, turning right (east) would face east, but the wall is 2 steps forward (north) which is the same as before. Not helpful.

Therefore, the correct next action is to turn left to face west, allowing the agent to proceed towards the key without hitting the wall.

Let's see. The goal is to pick up the yellow ball (which I already have) and then go to the green key. The agent already picked up the ball, so now the main task is to reach the green key.

Looking at the current observation: I'm carrying the yellow ball. There's a wall 3 steps forward, a wall 2 steps to the right, and the green key is 1 step to the right and 2 steps forward. 

So, I need to navigate to the green key. The key is located diagonally to the right and forward. But the agent can only move forward, turn left, or right. Let me figure out the direction.

Current direction isn't specified here, but based on previous actions, maybe the agent was facing a certain way. Let's assume the agent is facing north. If the key is 1 step right and 2 steps forward, that would mean it's to the east (right) and north (forward) from the agent's current position. 

If I need to go east and north, perhaps turning right (east) and then moving forward twice. But there's a wall 2 steps to the right. Wait, that wall is 2 steps right, which might be in the current direction. Wait, the observation says a wall 2 steps right. So if I'm facing north, then the wall to the right (east) is 2 steps away. The green key is 1 step east and 2 steps north. But if moving forward two steps from here would take me north, but there's a wall 3 steps forward. Wait, no, the current observation says a wall 3 steps forward, which is in the direction the agent is currently facing. So if the agent is facing north, moving forward would hit a wall in 3 steps. So moving forward isn't possible directly. 

The key is 1 step right and 2 steps forward. So to reach there, maybe the agent needs to turn right (east), then move forward twice. But the wall to the right is 2 steps away. Wait, the wall is 2 steps right. If I turn right (east), then moving forward would hit a wall in 2 steps. But the key is 1 step east (right turn) and 2 steps forward. But if the wall is 2 steps east, then moving forward from that position would hit the wall. That doesn't make sense. Maybe there's a different path.

Alternatively, maybe the agent should turn left (west) to face a different direction. But there's a wall 3 steps left. If the agent turns left (west), moving forward would hit a wall in 3 steps. Not helpful. 

Wait, the key is 1 step right and 2 steps forward. If the agent is facing north, then right is east, forward is north. So the key is northeast. But moving forward would hit a wall in 3 steps. So perhaps the agent needs to turn right (east), then move forward once, but then the wall is 2 steps east. Wait, if the agent is facing east after turning right, then moving forward once would take them 1 step east, which is where the key is? No, the key is 1 step right (east) and 2 steps forward (north). So if the agent turns right (east), then moves forward once, they are at 1 step east. Then they need to move north 2 steps. But moving north from there, how? The original direction was north. If they turned right to face east, then moving forward would go east. To go north, they would need to turn left again. But their current direction is east. So turning left from east would face north. Then moving forward twice. But the original observation says there's a wall 3 steps forward (in the original direction, north). But after turning east and moving forward once, their new position's forward direction is east, so the wall 2 steps east is now in front of them. Wait, the observation mentions a wall 2 steps right, which if the agent is facing east, right would be south. But the current observation's walls are based on the agent's current facing direction. 

This is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to visualize the agent's position and surroundings.

Current position: Agent is facing north. He has the yellow ball. There's a wall 3 steps forward (north), a wall 2 steps right (east), and the green key is 1 step east and 2 steps north. 

To reach the key at (east 1, north 2), the agent needs to move east and then north. But moving north directly is blocked by a wall after 3 steps. So the agent can't go straight north. Therefore, the agent must find a way to navigate around the wall. 

If the agent turns right (east), then the wall is 2 steps east. So moving forward once from facing east would take him to the key's east position (1 step east), but then he needs to go north 2 steps. But how? If he turns left from east (now facing north), then he can move forward twice. However, the original observation states a wall 3 steps forward (north), which would be in that path. But after moving east once, the forward direction is north again. Wait, but from the new position (1 step east), moving north would go towards the original position's forward direction. But the original wall is 3 steps forward from the original position. If the agent moves east once, then moving north twice would take him 2 steps north from that new position, which is total of 3 steps north from the original position. But there's a wall 3 steps north from the original position, so that path is blocked. 

Hmm, this suggests that the green key is in a position that's blocked by the wall. That can't be right. Maybe the agent needs to approach the key from a different angle. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent should turn left (west) initially. But there's a wall 3 steps west. So moving west isn't possible. 

Wait, maybe the key is not directly in the north direction but in a different quadrant. Let me re-read the observation:

""green key 1 step right and 2 steps forward""

Assuming the agent is facing north, right is east, forward is north. So the key is 1 east, 2 north. From the agent's current position, moving east 1 and north 2. But moving north 2 steps from the current position would hit the wall at 3 steps north. So that path is blocked. Therefore, the agent needs to find another way to reach the key. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent should move forward once, but there's a wall 3 steps forward. So moving forward once would take him to step 1 forward, but he can't go beyond that. Wait, no—the observation says a wall 3 steps forward, meaning that there's a wall 3 steps in the forward direction. So if the agent moves forward once, he's at 1 step, then again to 2, then again to 3, which is the wall. So he can move forward twice, but the third step is blocked. 

But the key is 2 steps forward from the current position. Wait, if the agent moves forward twice, he would be at 2 steps forward. Then, turning right (east) 1 step would reach the key. But the key is 1 step right and 2 steps forward. So if the agent moves forward twice, he's at 2 steps north. Then, turning right (east) 1 step would put him at the key's position. But can he turn right after moving forward twice? 

Wait, the agent's current direction is north. After moving forward twice, he's still facing north. Then turning right (east), moving 1 step would reach the key. But the problem is, is there a wall in that direction? The observation mentions a wall 2 steps right. If the agent is facing north, right is east. The wall is 2 steps east. So if he turns right (east) and moves 1 step, he's at 1 east, which is where the key is. But there's no wall mentioned there. The wall is 2 steps east. So that's okay. 

So the sequence would be:

1. go forward (to step 1 forward)
2. go forward again (to step 2 forward)
3. turn right (now facing east)
4. go forward (to reach the key at 1 east, 2 forward)

But according to the current observation, after moving forward twice, the agent's new position would have a wall 2 steps east? Wait, no. The original observation's walls are from the agent's initial position. Once the agent moves, the walls' positions might change based on the agent's new orientation. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent should first turn right to face east, then move forward once to reach the key's east position, then turn north (left) and move forward twice. But moving north twice from there would hit the wall. 

This is a bit confusing. Let's try to outline the possible steps based on the current observation.

Current state:

- Facing north
- Wall 3 steps forward (north)
- Wall 2 steps right (east)
- Green key at 1 east, 2 north

Possible actions:

- Turn right (east), then move forward once to reach 1 east. Then turn left (north) and move forward twice. But moving north twice from 1 east would be 1 east, 2 north, which is the key's position. Wait, the key is 1 east and 2 north. So if the agent turns right (east), moves 1 step (to 1 east), then turns left (north), and moves 2 steps, that would reach the key. But does moving north 2 steps from 1 east avoid the wall? The original wall is 3 steps north from the starting position. So from the starting position, moving north 3 steps is the wall. But from the position at 1 east, moving north 2 steps would be 3 steps north from the original position, which is the wall. So that's a problem. 

Therefore, that path is blocked. So the agent can't move north twice after turning left from east. 

Alternative idea: Maybe the agent should first move forward twice (to 2 north), then turn right (east), and move once to reach the key. But moving forward twice from the original position gets the agent to 2 north. Then turning right (east) and moving once would take him to 1 east, 2 north, which is the key. But is there a wall in that direction? The original wall is 2 steps east (from the original position). So when the agent is at 2 north, facing east, moving once would be 1 step east, which is clear because the wall is 2 steps east from the original position. So yes, that path is clear. 

So the steps would be:

1. go forward (1)
2. go forward (2)
3. turn right
4. go forward (to key)

This should work. Let's check:

After step 1: at 1 forward (north)
After step 2: at 2 forward (north)
Now facing north. Turn right to face east.
Move forward once: reaches 1 east, 2 north, which is the key's location. Then the agent can toggle to pick up the key. 

So the actions needed are go forward twice, turn right, go forward. 

But in the current observation, after moving forward twice, the agent's new position would have different walls? Or are the walls static based on the map? The problem is that the observations given are from the agent's current position and facing direction. So when the agent moves, the relative positions of the walls change. 

But according to the current observation, after moving forward twice, the agent's forward direction is still north, but the wall is 3 steps away. So moving forward twice would get to 2 steps forward, then the third step is the wall. 

Then, turning right (east) and moving forward once would take the agent to the key. 

So the correct sequence of actions would be go forward, go forward, turn right, go forward, then toggle. 

But in the current observation given, the agent is at a position where the green key is 1 step right and 2 steps forward. So the agent needs to adjust their direction to face east, move to the key's position, then toggle. 

So the immediate next action should be to turn right to face east, then go forward to reach the key. But according to the current observation, after turning right, how many steps forward to the key? The key is 1 step right and 2 steps forward. If the agent turns right (east), then the forward direction is east, but the key is 1 step east (right) and 2 steps north (forward from original position). Wait, no—if the agent turns right (east), their forward direction is east. The key is 1 step east and 2 steps north. So from the agent's current position, after turning right, the key is 1 step north and 1 step east? No, that doesn't make sense. 

I think I'm getting confused with the relative directions. Let's try to model it step by step.

Current position:

- Facing north
- Key is at 1 step east and 2 steps north.

If the agent turns right (east), their new forward direction is east. The key is 1 east and 2 north. So from the agent's current position:

To get to the key after turning right:

- Move forward (east) once would take them to 1 east. But they still need to go 2 north. But north from this new position is the original left direction. Wait, if the agent is facing east, their north is to the left. So to go north from this position, they need to turn left. 

So steps:

1. Turn right (east)
2. Move forward once (to 1 east)
3. Turn left (north)
4. Move forward twice (to 2 north)
5. Toggle to pick up the key.

But after step 2, the agent is at 1 east. The original wall is 3 steps north (from the starting position), which would be 2 steps north from the agent's current position at 1 east. So moving north twice from there would reach the wall. That's a problem. 

Therefore, this path is blocked. 

Alternative approach: Maybe the agent should first move north as much as possible before turning east. 

But moving forward twice gets the agent to 2 north (since the wall is at 3 steps). Then turn right (east) and move forward once to reach the key. 

Yes, that seems possible. 

So:

1. go forward (1)
2. go forward (2)
3. turn right
4. go forward (to key)

This would work because after moving forward twice, the agent is at 2 north. Turning right (east) and moving once takes them to 1 east, 2 north, which is the key's location. 

So the next action should be to turn right, then go forward. 

But in the current observation, the agent's forward direction is north with a wall at 3 steps. So moving forward is possible until step 2. 

But the current observation provided is after the agent has already picked up the yellow ball and is now facing a situation where the green key is 1 step right and 2 steps forward. The agent needs to decide the next action. 

In the latest observation given, the agent is facing a wall 3 steps forward, a wall 2 steps right, and the green key is 1 step right and 2 steps forward. 

So the agent is likely facing north. The key is to the east and north. To reach it, the agent needs to move east and then north. But moving north is blocked after 3 steps. 

So the correct path is to move forward twice to get to 2 north, then turn right (east) and move once to reach the key. 

Therefore, the immediate next action should be to go forward. Wait, but the agent is already at a position where moving forward twice is possible. However, in the current observation, after moving forward once, the agent's new position's walls would change. 

But according to the current observation, the agent's observation hasn't changed yet; the last action was turn left, and the new observation shows the green key at 1 step right and 2 steps forward. 

So the agent needs to determine the direction to face to reach the key. 

Assuming the agent is facing north:

- To reach the key at 1 east and 2 north, the agent needs to move east and then north. 

But moving north is blocked after 3 steps. So the agent must first move east, then north. But moving east 1 step would get them to the key's east position, then moving north 2 steps would hit the wall. 

Alternatively, move north 2 steps, then east 1 step. 

Moving north 2 steps is possible (since the wall is at 3 steps). Then turning right (east) and moving once. 

So the actions would be:

go forward (twice), then turn right, then go forward. 

But the agent needs to execute these steps in sequence. 

In the current observation, the agent's first action should be go forward to start moving north. But the problem is that the agent needs to decide the next step based on the current observation. 

Given the current observation:

- Wall 3 steps forward (north)
- Wall 2 steps right (east)
- Green key 1 step right (east) and 2 steps forward (north)

The agent needs to turn right (east) to face the direction where the key is eastward, then move forward twice. But moving forward twice from facing east would take the agent to 2 east, which is beyond the key's position (1 east). 

Wait, no. If the agent turns right (east), then the key is 1 step east (forward) and 2 steps north (left from the agent's new facing direction). 

This is getting too confusing. Let's try to think differently. 

The key is located at a position that's 1 step to the right and 2 steps forward from the agent's current position. Assuming the agent is facing north, right is east and forward is north. So the key is northeast. 

The agent needs to navigate to that position. The obstacle is a wall 3 steps north, which blocks the direct path. 

Possible solution: Navigate around the wall by moving east first, then north. 

But moving east 1 step (right turn and go forward once) would place the agent at 1 east. From there, moving north would require turning left (now facing north) and moving forward. But moving north from 1 east would be 2 steps north from the original position, which is the key's location. However, the original wall is at 3 steps north, so moving north twice from 1 east is allowed (since it's only 2 steps). 

So steps:

1. Turn right (east)
2. Go forward once (to 1 east)

Your previous output did not contain a valid action. Defaulted to action: go forward

Observation:
You carry a yellow ball
a wall 2 steps forward
a wall 2 steps right

19,Failed to obtain a valid action from the reasoning.,"<reasoning>
Let me try to figure out what to do here. The goal is to pick up the yellow ball first and then go to the green key. The user already picked up the yellow ball earlier, so now the task is to reach the green key.

Looking at the current observation: the agent is carrying the yellow ball. There's a wall 2 steps forward, a wall 2 steps to the right, and the green key is 1 step to the right and 1 step forward. So the agent's current position must have the key in front-right direction. 

The agent needs to move towards the key. The walls are blocking straight forward and to the right, so the agent can't go straight or directly right. The key is at 1 right and 1 forward. To get there, the agent might need to turn. Let's think about the directions.

If the agent is facing, say, north, and the key is to the northeast, but there's a wall directly north (2 steps forward) and a wall to the east (2 steps right), then the agent can't go straight. So maybe the agent needs to turn left or right to face a direction where the path to the key is clear. 

Wait, the agent's previous actions had them turning left and right, trying to navigate around the walls. The key's position is 1 step right and 1 step forward. Let's consider the agent's current facing direction. Suppose the agent is facing south. Then, moving forward would go towards the wall. To reach the key, which is to the right (east) and forward (south), but there's a wall to the right (east) two steps. Wait, maybe the agent needs to adjust their direction.

Alternatively, perhaps the agent needs to turn right first. If the agent turns right, facing east, but there's a wall two steps east. Then, moving forward from there would hit the wall. Hmm. Alternatively, if the agent turns left, facing west, but there's a wall two steps west. So that's not helpful. 

Wait, the key is 1 step right and 1 step forward. Let me visualize. If the agent is facing north, then right is east. The wall is 2 steps east (right) and 2 steps north (forward). The key is 1 east and 1 north. But moving forward from north would hit the wall in two steps. So the agent can't go straight north. Maybe the agent needs to turn west (left) to face west, but there's a wall two steps west. Alternatively, turn east (right) but the wall is two steps east. 

This is confusing. Maybe the agent needs to adjust their direction so that moving forward and right leads them to the key without hitting the walls. Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to go around the walls. Wait, but the key is only 1 step away in the right and forward directions. Let me think again. 

If the agent is facing north, and the key is 1 east and 1 north, but there's a wall two steps north and two steps east. So to get to the key, the agent would need to go east one step, but the wall is two steps east. That doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe the observation's directions are relative. So the key is 1 step right (east) and 1 step forward (north) from the agent's current position. But there's a wall two steps north and two steps east. So the agent can't go straight north or east. 

So perhaps the agent needs to turn south. Then, moving forward would be south, and right would be west. But the walls are two steps forward (south) and two steps right (west). The key is 1 east (which would be north?) and 1 forward (which would be south). Wait, maybe the directions are relative to the agent's facing. If the agent turns south, then forward is south, right is west. The key is 1 right (west) and 1 forward (south). But the wall is two steps forward (south) and two steps right (west). So the key is at 1 west and 1 south, but the wall is two steps in those directions. That can't be right. 

I'm probably getting the directions mixed up. Let's try another approach. The agent needs to reach the green key which is 1 step right and 1 step forward. The agent is facing a direction where moving forward would encounter a wall in two steps, and moving right would encounter a wall in two steps. The key is in a position that's one step in both those directions. 

So the agent must be facing a direction where forward and right are blocked by walls two steps away, but the key is one step in both. That suggests the agent is facing a corner where both the forward and right paths are blocked by walls, but the key is diagonally in front. 

In such a case, the agent needs to turn so that they can move towards the key. For example, if the agent turns left (west), then the key's position would be 1 step north and 1 step east relative to the new direction. Wait, this is getting too confusing. Maybe the best action here is to move forward, but that would hit the wall in two steps. Alternatively, turn in a direction that allows moving towards the key. 

Wait, the key is 1 step right and 1 step forward. If the agent turns right, then their new right direction is the original forward. So moving forward after turning right would be in the original forward direction, but the key is to the right (original right) and forward (original forward). So if the agent turns right, facing east, then moving forward would be east, but the wall is two steps east. The key is one step east and one step north (original directions). Hmm. 

Alternatively, if the agent turns left, facing west, then moving forward would be west, but the wall is two steps west. The key is one step east (original right) and one step north (original forward). So from the new direction (west), the key is two steps north and two steps east. That's not helpful. 

Maybe the agent needs to move in a direction that combines forward and right. For example, if the agent turns right (east), then tries to go forward, but that's blocked. Then turn left (north) and go forward. Wait, but turning left from facing east would make the agent face north. Then moving forward would be north, but the wall is two steps north. The key is one step east and one step north. So from facing north, moving east one step would get to the key's east position, but moving north would hit the wall. 

Alternatively, the agent could turn around 180 degrees (turn right twice) to face south. Then moving forward would be south. The key is one step east and one step north from original position. So facing south, the key is two steps north (which is behind) and one step east. So moving right (east) one step would reach the key's east position, then move forward (south) one step from there. But the problem is that from the agent's current position, the key is 1 right and 1 forward, which in the original facing direction (say north) is east and north. If the agent turns around to face south, then right is west. So moving right (west) one step would take them west, but the key is east. This isn't working. 

I'm getting stuck here. Maybe the correct action is to move forward, but that would hit the wall in two steps. The default action was to go forward, but that resulted in failure. Alternatively, the agent needs to turn in a direction that allows them to approach the key without hitting walls. 

Looking at the current observation again: walls are 2 steps forward and 2 steps right. The key is 1 step right and 1 step forward. So from the agent's current position, if they move right once, they would be at 1 step right, but the wall is 2 steps right. Wait, no. The key is 1 step right and 1 step forward. So if the agent moves forward once, they are 1 step forward (but there's a wall two steps forward). So moving forward would not hit the wall yet. Wait, the wall is three steps right initially, but after moving forward, the walls' positions might change. Wait, maybe the walls are in fixed positions, not relative to the agent's movement. 

This is getting too confusing. The key is 1 step right and 1 step forward. The walls are 2 steps forward and 2 steps right. So the agent needs to get to the key's position. The only way is to move in a direction that combines right and forward. For example, if the agent turns right and then moves forward, but the wall is two steps right. Alternatively, turn left and move forward. 

Wait, if the agent turns right (east), then their forward direction is east. The wall is two steps east. The key is one step east and one step north. So from facing east, moving forward (east) one step would reach the key's east position, but then they need to move north. But how? The agent can't move north directly because their forward is east. Maybe the agent needs to toggle or interact with something, but there's no object mentioned. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to turn left (north) and move forward. But the wall is two steps north. The key is one step east and one step north. From facing north, moving east one step would reach the key's east position, then moving north would hit the wall. 

This is really tricky. The only possible valid action that doesn't hit a wall immediately is to turn in a direction that allows approaching the key. Since the key is 1 right and 1 forward, perhaps the agent needs to turn 45 degrees, but the actions only allow turning left or right (90 degrees). 

Alternatively, maybe the agent should turn right, then move forward, but that would be east, which is blocked. So instead, turn left (north) and move forward, but that's blocked. 

Wait, maybe the agent is facing a direction where forward is blocked by a wall two steps away, and right is also blocked two steps. The key is in a position that's one step in both directions. So the agent must navigate around the walls. For example, move forward once, then turn right, then move forward, etc. But in the current observation, moving forward would be towards the wall in two steps. Wait, no—the wall is three steps right initially, but after moving forward once, the distance to the wall might decrease. 

Wait, the initial observation had a wall three steps right. After moving forward a few times, the distance to the wall changes. But in the latest observations, the wall is two steps forward and two steps right. The key is 1 step right and 1 step forward. So perhaps the agent has moved forward a couple of steps, reducing the distance to the wall. 

In this case, the agent is close to the wall. The key is just one step beyond the wall? No, that doesn't make sense. The key must be in a reachable position. 

I think the correct action here is to turn right, then move forward. But let's check: if the agent turns right, their new forward direction is east (assuming original was north). The wall is two steps east. Moving forward from there would be one step east (towards the key's east position), but the key is also one step forward (north). Wait, this is confusing. 

Alternatively, after turning right, the agent's forward is east. The key is one step right (which would be north from the new facing) and one step forward (east). So from the new direction, the key is one step north and one step east. To get there, the agent would need to move north and east, but they can only move one step at a time. 

This is getting too complicated. Given the limited actions, the best bet might be to turn right and then move forward, hoping that it brings the agent closer to the key without hitting the wall. Alternatively, turn left and move forward. 

But in the current observation, moving forward would be two steps to the wall. Wait, the wall is two steps forward. So moving forward once would bring the agent to one step from the wall. Then they could move right towards the key. 

Wait, the agent's current position has a wall two steps forward and two steps right. The key is one step right and one step forward. So if the agent moves forward once, they are now one step away from the wall. Then, turning right would face them east (if original direction was north), and moving right (east) one step would reach the key's right position. Then moving forward (north) one step would reach the key. But how does that work? 

Let me break it down step by step:

1. Current position: agent is facing north.
   - Wall: 2 steps north (forward), 2 steps east (right).
   - Key: 1 east and 1 north.

2. Action: move forward once. Now agent is one step north, one step away from the wall.
   - Wall is now one step ahead.
   - Key is now at 1 east and 0 north (since agent moved north once).

3. Turn right (now facing east).
   - Key is 1 step east (agent's right is now east).
   - Move forward (east) once. Now agent is at the key's position.
   - Then pick up the key (but wait, the key is in front, so toggle action).

But the key is in front after moving right. So after turning right and moving forward, the agent is facing the key and can toggle it to pick it up.

However, in the current observation, the agent is already carrying the yellow ball. The goal is to go to the green key after picking up the ball. So the next step is to reach the green key. 

But according to the latest observation, the agent is carrying the yellow ball, walls are two steps forward and two steps right, and the key is one step right and one step forward. 

So the agent needs to navigate to the key's position. The key is in a position that's one step in both right and forward directions from the agent's current position. The walls are two steps in those directions. 

The only way is to move in a direction that combines right and forward. Since the agent can't move diagonally, they have to turn and move in a straight line. 

For example, if the agent turns right, their forward direction is east. Moving forward once would get them to the wall's edge (two steps east, now one step). Then turn left (now facing north) and move forward to reach the key. 

Wait, let's visualize:

- Agent is facing north.
- Key is at (east 1, north 1).
- Wall at north 2, east 2.

1. Turn right (now facing east).
2. Move forward once → at east 1, north 0.
3. Now, facing east, wall is at east 2 (which is now one step ahead).
4. Turn left (now facing north).
5. Move forward once → at east 1, north 1 (key's position).
6. Toggle to pick up the key.

But in the current observation, the agent is already carrying the yellow ball, so step 6 would be to toggle the key. 

However, the agent's current observation shows the green key 1 step right and 1 step forward. So after turning right and moving forward, the agent would be at the key's position and can toggle it. 

But the problem is that in the current observation, the wall is two steps forward and two steps right. So moving forward once would reduce the wall distance to one step. Then turning right and moving forward again would hit the wall. 

This is getting too complicated. Given the possible actions and the current observation, the safest valid action that doesn't hit a wall immediately is to turn right or left and then move forward. 

Looking at the previous actions, the agent had been turning left and right to navigate. The latest observation after defaulting to go forward shows the green key at 1 step right and 1 step forward, walls at 2 steps forward and right. 

The correct action here should be to turn right, then move forward. Because after turning right, the agent's forward direction is east, and moving forward once would get them to the key's right position (since the key is 1 step right and 1 step forward from the original position). Wait, no. If the agent turns right (east), their forward is east. The key is 1 step east and 1 step north. So from the new direction, moving forward (east) once would get to the key's east position, but the key is also one step north. So the agent would need to move north after turning right. But how? 

Alternatively, after turning right, the agent's right is north. So moving right (north) once would bring them to the key's north position. Then moving forward (east) once would reach the key. But the agent can't move right while facing east; right is north in that case. 

This is really confusing. Maybe the best action here is to move forward, but that's two steps to the wall. Alternatively, turn right and move forward. 

Wait, the key is 1 step right and 1 step forward. If the agent turns right, their forward is east. Moving forward once would be east 1, which is the key's right position. Then they need to move north 1, which is their left direction. But the agent can't move north directly; they have to turn. 

This seems impossible with the given actions. The only possible valid action that doesn't lead to a wall immediately is to turn right or left. 

Looking at the current observation: walls are two steps forward and two steps right. The key is one step in both. So the agent must be facing a direction where forward and right are blocked by walls, but the key is diagonally in front. 

In such a scenario, the agent needs to turn 90 degrees to face a direction where they can move towards the key. For example, if the agent turns right (east), then moves forward, but the wall is two steps east. So that's not possible. 

Alternatively, turn left (north), move forward, but the wall is two steps north. 

This is a dead end. The only possible action that doesn't immediately hit a wall is to turn in a direction. Since the key is to the right and forward, perhaps turning right and then moving forward is the way. But as established, moving forward after turning right would hit the wall. 

Wait, no. The wall is two steps forward in the original direction. After turning right, the forward direction is east, and the wall is two steps east. So moving forward once would be one step east (towards the key's right position), then the agent can turn left (north) and move forward to reach the key. 

So the sequence would be:

1. Turn right.
2. Move forward (east 1).
3. Turn left (now facing north).
4. Move forward (north 1) to reach the key.

But the agent needs to","

Your previous output did not contain a valid action. Defaulted to action: go forward

Observation:

a green key 1 step right",0,False
20,turn right,"<reasoning>
Let's see. The current observation says I'm carrying a yellow ball, there's a wall 1 step forward, and the green key is 1 step to the right. The goal is to pick up the yellow ball and then go to the green key.

First, I need to get to the green key. Since the key is to the right, I should probably turn right. But wait, I need to check the current direction. In previous steps, the assistant had been turning left and right to adjust direction. But since this is the current state, assuming the last action was ""go forward"" which led to this observation.

The wall is directly forward, so going forward isn't an option. The green key is 1 step right. If I'm facing a direction where right is the correct path, then turning right would allow moving towards the key. After turning right, I can go forward to reach the key. Then, once in front of the key, I can toggle it to pick it up. Let me confirm the action steps.

So the plan is: turn right to face the key's direction, then go forward once to be in front of the key, then toggle to interact with it. Since the key is 1 step right, turning right would align me to face the direction where the key is. Then moving forward once gets me next to it, and toggling picks it up. That should work. Let me make sure there's no wall blocking that path. The observation mentions a wall 1 step forward, which would be in the original direction, not the new direction after turning. So turning right should clear the wall forward. Therefore, the correct actions are turn right, go forward, then toggle. But the user is asking for the next action based on the current observation. The current step is after the last default go forward, and the key is 1 step right. So the immediate next action should be to turn right to face the key's location, allowing movement towards it. Then go forward, then toggle. But since the question is for the next action, it's to turn right first.
