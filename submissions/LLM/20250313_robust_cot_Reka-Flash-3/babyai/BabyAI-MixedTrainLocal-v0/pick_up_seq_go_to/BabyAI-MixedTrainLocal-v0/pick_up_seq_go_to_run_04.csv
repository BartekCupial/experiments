The goal is to pick up a blue box and then go to another blue box. But in the current observation, there are walls blocking. The observation says a wall 1 step forward and a wall 2 steps right. So I need to figure out where the blue boxes are and how to navigate around the walls.

First, I can't go forward because there's a wall right in front. So turning left or right might be necessary to find a path. Let's think. If I turn left, maybe that opens up a direction where I can move forward without hitting the wall. Similarly, turning right could also help. But how do I know which direction to turn?

Wait, the problem is that the current observation doesn't mention any boxes yet. The agent hasn't picked up any object. So maybe the blue boxes are somewhere else that I can't see right now because of the walls. So I need to navigate around the walls to find them.

Since there's a wall 1 step forward, going forward isn't an option. Turning left might give a path. Let's assume that turning left would allow me to move in a direction where there's no wall. Then, after turning, I can go forward. Alternatively, turning right might also be possible. But which direction?

Alternatively, maybe I should toggle something, but the toggle action is for interacting with objects in front. But right now, in front is a wall, so toggling wouldn't do anything useful. Similarly, picking up or dropping isn't possible here because there's nothing to pick up.

So the best immediate action is to turn either left or right to avoid the wall in front. Let's pick one. Let's say I turn left. Then I can move forward. If that's possible, that would let me proceed. Alternatively, turning right. But without knowing the exact layout, it's a guess. But the problem says that repeating the same action doesn't make sense, so I need to choose a direction.

So the first action should be to turn left or right. Let's go with turn left first. Then maybe proceed. Let's go with that.

1,turn left,"<reasoning>
Let's see. The current observation is that there's a wall 5 steps forward, a wall 1 step right, and a blue box 2 steps left and 4 steps forward. The goal is to pick up a blue box and then go to another blue box.

First, I need to figure out the direction I should be facing. The last action was turning left, so maybe I'm facing north or some direction now. But the observation doesn't mention my current orientation. Wait, the game doesn't specify the agent's facing direction in the observation. That's a problem. Without knowing which way I'm facing, it's hard to plan the path.

But maybe I can infer based on past actions. Previously, the agent turned left. Let's assume that after turning left, the agent's facing direction changed. Let's say initially the agent was facing north. Turn left would make them face west. Then, moving forward would go west. But in the first observation, there was a wall 1 step forward (west) and a wall 2 steps right (south). So maybe after turning left, moving forward would hit the wall. But in the current observation, the walls are 5 steps forward and 1 step right. Hmm, maybe after turning left, the agent is facing a different direction now.

Alternatively, perhaps I should focus on the position of the blue box. It's 2 steps left and 4 steps forward. So relative to the agent's current position, the blue box is to the left and ahead. To reach it, the agent needs to move in a direction that allows them to go left and forward. But there's a wall 5 steps forward, so maybe the agent can't go straight forward for a long distance. The wall 1 step right suggests that to the right (maybe east?), there's a wall nearby.

Wait, maybe the agent is facing east. If the wall is 1 step right, that would be south. Then 5 steps forward would be north, but that's a wall. But the blue box is 2 steps left and 4 forward. If facing east, left would be north. So moving north 2 steps and then east 4 steps? But there's a wall 5 steps forward (east) and a wall 1 step right (south). So moving east would hit a wall after 5 steps, but the blue box is 4 steps east. So maybe the agent can go east 4 steps, but I need to check if there are walls in the way.

Alternatively, if facing west, then left would be south, and forward would be west. The wall 5 steps forward is west, so moving west would hit a wall. The blue box is 2 steps left (south) and 4 steps forward (west). That might not work. Hmm.

This is confusing without knowing the agent's current direction. Maybe the agent needs to turn around. The current observation has a wall 5 steps forward and 1 step right. If the agent turns right twice, that would make them face the opposite direction, but then moving forward might be possible. But turning right from the previous direction (assuming facing west after turning left once) would face south. Then moving forward would go south, but there's no mention of walls in that direction. Wait, the current observation only mentions walls 5 steps forward and 1 step right. So if forward is west, right would be south. Then moving forward (west) 5 steps is a wall, and right (south) 1 step is also a wall. So the agent is in a position where they can't go straight west or south, but there's a blue box 2 steps left (north) and 4 steps forward (west). 

But if facing west, left is north, so moving north 2 steps and then west 4 steps would reach the blue box. But moving north 2 steps from the current position. However, the agent needs to check if there are walls in those directions. The current observation doesn't mention walls north, only west and south. So maybe the path is clear. So the agent should turn left again to face north, move forward 2 steps, then turn around (maybe turn left twice to face west), and then move forward 4 steps to reach the blue box. Then pick it up. After that, the goal is to go to another blue box, but the current observation doesn't mention another blue box. Wait, the original goal was to go to a blue box after picking up a blue box. So the first blue box is the one to pick up, then go to another? But the current observation only shows one blue box. Maybe after picking it up, there's another one? Or maybe the initial instruction was to pick up a blue box and then go to another blue box. But in the current observation, only one blue box is present. 

Wait, the user's initial instruction says: ""Your goal is to go to a blue box after you pick up a blue box."" So the sequence is: pick up a blue box, then go to a blue box (maybe a different one). But in the current observation, there's only one blue box. So perhaps after picking it up, the environment changes, revealing another blue box. But the current observation doesn't show that. So maybe the agent needs to first pick up the blue box, then navigate to where the other blue box is. However, based on the current observation, the agent is at a position where they can see the blue box 2 steps left and 4 forward. So the plan is: navigate to that blue box, pick it up, then go to another blue box. But since the other blue box isn't visible here, maybe after picking up, the agent needs to explore. 

But the current step is to choose an action based on the current observation. The agent hasn't picked up the blue box yet. So the first priority is to reach the blue box. So how to get there. Let's think again. Assuming the agent is facing a certain direction. Let's say after turning left once, the agent is facing west. Then the blue box is 2 steps left (north) and 4 steps forward (west). So to get there, the agent needs to turn left again to face north, move 2 steps, then turn around (turn left twice to face south?), wait, no. If facing north, moving forward would go north, but the blue box is 2 steps left (west) from there? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused with directions. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to turn right to face south, then move forward, but that's blocked by the wall 1 step right (south). Hmm. This is tricky. Maybe the best approach is to turn left again to face a direction that allows moving towards the blue box. If facing north after two left turns, then moving forward 4 steps west (since the blue box is 4 steps forward from the current position, which is west). Wait, the blue box is 2 steps left and 4 steps forward. If left is north and forward is west, then from current position, moving north 2 steps, then west 4 steps. So the agent needs to turn left to face north, move 2 steps, then turn left again to face west, then move 4 steps. 

But before moving, the agent should check if there are walls in those paths. The current observation says there's a wall 5 steps forward (west) and 1 step right (south). So moving west 4 steps would be okay because it's not beyond the wall at 5 steps. So the agent can proceed. 

So the actions would be: turn left (to face north), go forward 2, turn left again (face west), go forward 4, then pick up. 

In the current observation, the agent needs to choose the first action. So the first step is to turn left to face north. Then move forward 2. But the observation's current state is after the agent turned left once (from the previous step). So now, the agent is facing west. Wait, the initial action in the first turn was ""turn left"", so if initially facing north, turning left would face west. Then the current observation is with walls 5 forward (west) and 1 right (south). The blue box is 2 left (north) and 4 forward (west). So to get to the blue box, the agent needs to go north 2, then west 4. 

So first, from facing west, turning left would face north. Then move forward 2. Then turn left again to face west (since now facing north, turning left would be west), then move forward 4. Then pick up. 

But the current observation's agent must choose the next action. So the first action should be to turn left again (from facing west, turning left to face north). Then go forward 2. 

But in the current observation, the agent's last action was turning left (from the previous step). So now, the agent is facing west. The blue box is 2 steps left (north) and 4 steps forward (west). 

So to face north, the agent needs to turn left again. Then move forward 2 steps to reach north. Then turn left again to face west, then move forward 4 steps. Then pick up. 

So the first action should be to turn left (from facing west, turning left makes north). Then next action is go forward 2. But the user is asking for the next action based on the current observation. So the current observation has the blue box 2 steps left and 4 forward. The agent's current direction is west (assuming previous action was turn left from north to west). 

So the agent needs to turn left (to face north), then go forward 2. So the first action should be turn left. 

Wait, but in the current observation, the agent is facing west (since the previous action was turn left from north to west). The blue box is 2 steps left (north) and 4 steps forward (west). So left from west is north. So to face north, the agent needs to turn left. Then move forward 2 steps to reach the blue box's north position. Then turn left again (to face west) and move forward 4 steps. 

Therefore, the next action should be turn left to face north. That way, moving forward 2 steps would get closer to the blue box. 

So the chosen action is turn left.

2,turn left,"<reasoning>
Let's see where I need to go. The goal is to get to the blue box after picking it up. First, I need to pick up the blue box, but right now I'm holding nothing. The current observation shows a blue box that's 1 step right and 4 steps forward. I need to reach that box.

Looking at the walls, there's a wall 6 steps forward and another wall 2 steps left. So my movement options might be limited. Let's map this out. If the blue box is to the right and forward, maybe I need to turn right to face that direction. But the last observation had me turning left twice, which might have changed my direction. Wait, the previous actions were turning left, so maybe I'm facing north after two turns? Let me think.

If I started facing north, turning left once would make me face west. Another left turn would face south. Then, the current observation has a wall 6 steps forward (which would be south now) and a wall 2 steps left (which would be east). The blue box is 1 step right (east) and 4 steps forward (north). Wait, that can't be right because the wall is 6 steps forward south. Maybe my direction is different.

Alternatively, perhaps after turning left twice from the initial position, I'm facing south. Then, forward would be south, which has a wall 6 steps away. The blue box is 1 step right (east) and 4 steps forward (north). But north is behind me if I'm facing south. So that's a problem. Maybe I need to adjust my direction.

Wait, maybe I should first figure out my current facing direction. Let's assume the initial direction was north. The first user's action was turning left, so facing west. Then the next observation had a wall 1 step right (east) and blue box 2 steps left and 4 forward. If facing west, left would be south. Hmm, maybe this is getting complicated. Let's try a different approach.

The blue box is 1 step right and 4 steps forward from my current position. To reach it, I need to move in a direction that aligns with that position. If I'm facing north, then right would be east. The blue box is east 1 and north 4. But the wall is 6 steps forward north, which means I can't go that way. So I need to find a path to the blue box without hitting the walls.

Alternatively, maybe I need to turn right to face east. If I turn right from my current direction (assuming after two left turns I'm facing south), turning right would face me east. Then, I can go forward towards the blue box. Let me check the current observation: wall 6 steps forward (which would be south), wall 2 steps left (which would be east if facing south). So if I turn right towards east, the wall is 2 steps left, meaning 2 steps east? Wait, that can't be. Maybe the directions are relative.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to first turn around. Let me think: if the blue box is 1 step right and 4 steps forward, and there's a wall 6 steps forward and 2 steps left, maybe I should turn right to face a direction where I can approach the blue box.

Wait, perhaps turning right from my current direction (after two left turns, facing south) would make me face east. Then, moving forward would take me east, but the wall is 2 steps left. If I'm facing east, left would be south. The wall is 2 steps south, so moving forward east, then I can go east until the blue box is reached. But the blue box is 1 step right (which would be north if facing east?) Wait, no. If facing east, right would be south. Hmm, maybe I'm getting mixed up with directions.

Let me try to visualize this. Suppose I'm facing south. To the east (right) is 2 steps away a wall. Forward (south) is 6 steps to a wall. The blue box is 1 step right (east) and 4 steps forward (north). But north is behind me. So going north isn't possible because of the wall. So how can I reach the blue box?

Maybe I need to go around the wall. If I turn right (east), but there's a wall 2 steps to the left (which would be south if facing east). Wait, facing east, left is south. The wall is 2 steps south. So if I go east, I can move forward until I hit the south wall at 2 steps. But the blue box is north of that. This seems complicated.

Alternatively, maybe the best approach is to first pick up the blue box once I'm in position. But to get there, I need to navigate around the walls. Let's see: the blue box is 1 step right and 4 steps forward. If I can turn right to face east, then move east, then turn north (which would be left from facing east?), but I need to avoid the walls.

Wait, maybe I need to first turn left again. If I'm facing south and turn left, I face west. Then moving forward west would take me away from the wall. But the blue box is east and north. This is confusing. Maybe I should try to turn left again to face west, then move forward until I can adjust direction.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to drop something first, but I'm not holding anything. So that's not necessary. The key is to get to the blue box, pick it up, then go to another blue box. But right now, the task is just to pick up the blue box.

Wait, the current observation has the blue box at 1 step right and 4 steps forward. So maybe I need to move in a direction that allows me to reach that position. Let me think about the required steps.

If the blue box is 1 step right and 4 steps forward, I need to adjust my direction so that moving forward takes me towards it. For example, if I face north, right is east. The blue box is east 1 and north 4. But the wall is 6 steps north, so that's not possible. Therefore, I must face a different direction.

Alternatively, if I face east, then right is south. The blue box is south 1 and east 4. But the wall is 2 steps south (left from facing east). So moving east initially, then turning south (right) to approach the blue box. But moving forward east, then turning right (south), then moving 1 step south and 4 steps east? Wait, that doesn't align with the blue box's position.

Hmm, perhaps I need to first turn right to face east, then move forward until I can turn north. But the wall is 2 steps south when facing east. So moving east, then turning north (left) would allow me to go around the wall. Let's try:

1. Turn right (face east).
2. Move forward as much as possible without hitting the wall. But the wall is 2 steps left (south) when facing east. So moving forward east, then turning north (left) and moving forward.

Wait, but the blue box is 1 step right and 4 forward. If I face east, then moving north (left) would take me north. The blue box is 1 step right (which would be south) and 4 steps forward (east). That doesn't match. I'm getting stuck here.

Maybe I should try a different approach. The blue box is 1 step right and 4 steps forward. Let's consider possible directions I can face to reach it:

- If facing north: right is east. To get to east 1 and north 4, but north is blocked by a wall 6 steps away. Not possible.
- If facing east: right is south. To get to south 1 and east 4. But south is blocked by a wall 2 steps away (left when facing east). Not possible.
- If facing south: right is west. To get to west 1 and south 4. But south is blocked by a wall 6 steps away. Not possible.
- If facing west: right is north. To get to north 1 and west 4. North is blocked by a wall, but if I move west 4 steps and then north 1, but north is blocked. Not possible.

This is confusing. Maybe the problem is that the blue box's position is relative to my current direction. Wait, the observation says ""a blue box 1 step right and 4 steps forward"". So regardless of my direction, right and forward are relative to me. So my current direction affects where right and forward point.

So, for example, if I'm facing north, right is east. So the blue box is east 1 and north 4. But north is blocked. If I'm facing east, right is south. The blue box is south 1 and east 4. But south is blocked by a wall 2 steps left (south when facing east). Hmm.

Wait, the current observation says there's a wall 6 steps forward and 2 steps left. Let's assume I'm facing south. Then forward is south (6 steps to wall), left is east (2 steps to wall). The blue box is 1 step right (east) and 4 steps forward (north). But north is behind me. So how can I get there?

Alternatively, if I turn right (face east), then left is south (2 steps to wall). The blue box is 1 step right (south) and 4 steps forward (east). So moving east 4 steps would get me to the blue box's forward direction, but then I need to go south 1 step. But the wall is only 2 steps south when facing east. So moving east 4 steps, then turning right (south) and moving 1 step south, but the wall is 2 steps south, so that would hit the wall. Not possible.

Alternatively, if I turn left from facing south (now west), then forward is west. The blue box is 1 step right (north) and 4 steps forward (west). Moving west 4 steps would get me to the forward position, then turning right (north) and moving 1 step north, but the wall is 6 steps forward (west), so moving west 4 steps is possible. Then turning right (north) and moving 1 step would reach the blue box. That could work.

So steps:

1. Turn left (face west).
2. Go forward 4 steps (avoiding the wall at 6 steps forward when facing south).
3. Turn right (face north).
4. Go forward 1 step to reach the blue box.
5. Pick up the blue box.

But how do I know how many steps to go forward? The observation only tells me the distance to the wall, not obstacles in between. So maybe I can go forward until I hit a wall or the blue box. But the problem is that the blue box is 4 steps forward when facing west. But if I go forward 4 steps west, then turn north and go 1 step, that would reach it. But I need to execute these actions.

In the current observation, the blue box is 1 step right and 4 forward. So if I face west, right is north, and forward is west. So moving forward 4 steps west would get me to the position where the blue box is 4 steps forward (from west) and 1 step right (north). So yes, that makes sense.

So first, turn left to face west. Then go forward 4 steps. Then turn right (now facing north) and go forward 1 step to pick up the blue box.

But the user is asking for the next action based on the current observation. So what should I do now? The current observation is:

a wall 6 steps forward

a wall 2 steps left

a blue box 1 step right and 4 steps forward

Assuming I'm facing south (because previous turns were left twice: north -> west -> south). So current direction is south.

The blue box is 1 step right (east) and 4 steps forward (north). But north is behind me. So to get there, I need to turn left (west), move forward 4 steps, then turn right (north), then move 1 step.

But the first action I can take is to turn left or right, or go forward, etc.

So the next action should be to turn left to face west. Then go forward. But since I need to output the first action, the best immediate action is to turn left to face west, which would allow me to move forward towards the blue box.

So the answer should be turn left.
</reasoning>

 <sep> human:","a wall 2 steps forward
a wall 1 step left",0,False
3,turn right,"<reasoning>
Let's see. The current observation says there's a wall 2 steps forward and a wall 1 step left. I need to figure out where the blue box is and how to get to it after picking it up. Let me look back at the previous observations.

In the last few observations, the blue box was moving around. First, it was 2 steps left and 4 forward. Then, after turning left, it became 1 step right and 4 forward. Another left turn made it 1 step right and 4 forward again? Wait, maybe not. Wait, the third observation after turning left, the blue box was 1 step right and 4 forward. Then the current observation shows walls in different positions. So the agent must have turned left again.

Now, with walls in front and left, the agent might be facing a direction where the blue box is to the right and forward. But how to navigate? The goal is to first pick up the blue box, then go to another blue box. Wait, the original task is to go to the blue box after picking up a blue box. So first, I need to pick up the blue box, then move to another one. But the current observation doesn't mention the blue box. Maybe it's behind me or around a corner.

But in the previous steps, the agent turned left multiple times, which might have changed orientation. Let's think about directions. Assuming the agent starts facing north. First, there's a wall 1 step forward and 2 steps right. Turning left (west) would face the agent west. Then the next observation shows a wall 5 steps forward and 1 step right. So after turning left, facing west, there's a wall ahead (5 steps) and a wall to the right (east, 1 step). Then turning left again (south), the next observation shows a wall 6 steps forward and 2 steps left. So facing south, walls ahead and to the left. Then turning left again (east), current observation has walls 2 steps forward and 1 step left. So facing east again.

In this direction, facing east with walls in front and left. The blue box's position might have changed. But how to find it? The agent needs to navigate around the walls to reach the blue box. Since the previous blue box positions were to the left and forward, maybe after turning left multiple times, the blue box is now to the right or elsewhere.

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to go forward past the wall? But the wall is 2 steps forward. Wait, the current observation says a wall 2 steps forward. So if the agent tries to go forward, they'll hit the wall. So turning directions is necessary.

Since the agent needs to pick up the blue box first, I need to locate it. If the blue box isn't visible in the current observation, maybe the agent needs to turn right to face a different direction where the blue box is. For example, turning right (now facing south) but in the previous steps, turning left three times would have made the agent face east again. Wait, maybe the agent is facing east now, and the blue box is 1 step right (south?) and 4 steps forward. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the agent should try to move around the walls. For example, if facing east with a wall 2 steps forward, turning right (south) and then moving forward. But in the previous observation, after turning left three times, the agent was facing east again with walls in front and left. So turning right (south) would face a new direction. Let me check the previous steps:

1. Start facing north.
2. Turn left (west), observation shows wall 5 forward, 1 right (east).
3. Turn left (south), observation shows wall 6 forward, 2 left (west).
4. Turn left (east), current observation: wall 2 forward, 1 left (north).

So now, facing east. The blue box's previous position was 1 step right and 4 forward. If facing east, ""right"" would be south. So 1 step south and 4 steps east. But the current walls are 2 steps forward (east) and 1 step left (north). Maybe the blue box is around the corner somewhere. But the agent can't see it yet. So perhaps the agent needs to go forward 1 step (but there's a wall 2 steps forward, so only 1 step possible before hitting the wall). Wait, the observation says ""a wall 2 steps forward"", which means the agent can move forward 1 step and then hit the wall. So moving forward once would get them next to the wall.

Alternatively, the agent could turn right (south) to face a new direction. If they turn right, they're facing south. Then check if there's a path. But in the previous observation when facing south (after turning left twice), there was a wall 6 steps forward. So maybe turning right (south) from the current position (facing east) would have walls ahead. Hmm, not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe the agent should go back. If facing east, turning around (turn left twice) would face west. But in the first observation, facing west had a wall 2 steps right. Not sure.

Alternatively, the agent might need to toggle something. But the blue box isn't mentioned here, so perhaps it's not in front. The agent needs to pick up the blue box first. Since the current observation doesn't mention the blue box, the agent must not be facing it. So the best action is to turn left or right to face a direction where the blue box might be. For example, turning left (north) again, but in the previous steps, facing north had a wall 1 step forward. So that's not helpful.

Wait, the initial goal is to pick up the blue box first, then go to another blue box. So the priority is to pick up the blue box. If the current observation doesn't show the blue box, the agent needs to navigate to where it was previously. Let's track the blue box's movement:

First observation: blue box 2 left, 4 forward (assuming initial position).
After turning left (west), blue box becomes 2 steps left and 4 forward in the new orientation. Wait, directions change when turning. Turning left (west), the coordinates would change. Maybe the blue box is now 4 steps forward (which was west) and 2 steps right (which would be south?). This is getting complex. Maybe the agent should proceed step by step.

Alternatively, since the agent can't see the blue box now, the best action is to turn left or right to explore. Given the current walls, turning left (north) would face a wall 1 step left, but the agent is facing east. Wait, current observation: facing east, walls 2 forward and 1 left (north). If the agent turns left (north), they'd face north with a wall 1 step left (west). But the blue box's previous position was 1 step right and 4 forward when facing west. Hmm, perhaps this is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, the agent should try to move forward if possible. But moving forward 1 step would reach the wall. So that's not helpful. So the next best action is to turn in a direction that might lead to the blue box. Since the previous positions had the blue box to the left and forward, maybe turning right (south) from the current facing (east) would face a direction where the blue box is. But earlier observations when facing south had a wall 6 steps forward, which might block the path. So perhaps not.

Alternatively, the agent needs to go back. Turn around (two left turns) to face west. Then move forward. But in the first observation, facing west had a wall 2 steps right. Wait, when facing west, right would be south. So moving forward from west would hit a wall 1 step right (south). Not helpful.

Alternatively, the agent could toggle something, but there's no mention of an interactive object in front. The current observation only mentions walls. So the only possible actions are turn left, turn right, go forward (but can't due to wall), pick up (no object here), drop (not holding anything), toggle (nothing to toggle).

Since the agent can't move forward and there's no object to pick up or toggle, the only actions are turning left or right. The previous actions were turning left multiple times, which might have led the agent in a circle. Maybe turning right now to change direction could help. Let's try turning right. If the agent turns right (south), facing south. Then the walls would be 6 steps forward (from previous observation when facing south). But that's a long way. Alternatively, maybe the blue box is around the corner when facing south.

Alternatively, the agent needs to think that after picking up the blue box, they need to go to another one. But first, they must pick it up. Since the current observation doesn't show the blue box, the agent must have moved away from it. So maybe they need to retrace their steps. But how?

Alternatively, the agent could turn left again, making a U-turn. Facing north again. But the first observation had a wall 1 step forward. So moving forward isn't possible. So turning left again would face north, walls 1 step left (west). Not helpful.

In this case, the available actions are turn left, turn right, or go forward (which is blocked). Since the agent can't go forward, the best options are to turn left or right. The previous actions were turning left three times, which might have made the agent face east again. Maybe turning right now (south) would explore a new direction where the blue box could be. But without more information, it's hard to say. However, based on the previous pattern, the agent might need to turn left again to face north, but that's blocked. Alternatively, turn right to face south and see if there's a path.

But since the agent's goal is to pick up the blue box first, and it's not visible right now, the best bet is to change direction in hopes of locating it. Turning left again (north) would face a wall 1 step left (west), which isn't helpful. Turning right (south) might face a path where the blue box is. Let's choose to turn right.

Let me try to figure out what the agent should do here. The goal is to go to a blue box after picking up a blue box. This seems a bit confusing. Wait, the original instruction says to go to a blue box after picking up a blue box. Maybe that's a typo? Or perhaps the task is to pick up a blue box first and then go to another blue box? Let me read the problem again.

The user's goal is to ""go to a blue box after you pick up a blue box."" So the sequence should be: first pick up a blue box, and then go to another blue box. Wait, but why would you need to pick up a blue box to then go to another one? Maybe the first blue box is the one to pick up, and the destination is another blue box. But the observation shows a blue box at 1 step right and 4 steps forward. Let me check the current observation.

Current Observation:
- A wall 6 steps forward.
- A wall 2 steps left.
- A blue box 1 step right and 4 steps forward.

So, the blue box is diagonally to the right and forward. The agent's current direction must be such that moving forward would hit a wall, but moving right also hits a wall after 2 steps. The previous observations showed the blue box's position changing slightly, which probably indicates the agent's rotation. The agent needs to navigate to the blue box, pick it up, and then go to another blue box. But in the current observation, there's only one blue box mentioned. Wait, maybe after picking it up, the other blue box becomes visible? Or perhaps the initial instruction had a mistake, and the correct goal is to pick up a blue box and then go to a different location (maybe another blue box that's not mentioned here).

Looking back at the history, in the previous steps, the agent turned left multiple times, possibly to face the direction of the blue box. The latest observation shows the blue box at 1 step right and 4 steps forward. If the agent is facing north, for example, turning left might make them face west, but then how to reach the blue box which is right and forward. Wait, maybe the agent needs to adjust their direction to face east (right) and then move forward towards the blue box. But the current observation mentions a wall 1 step left, so if the agent is facing east, moving left would be north, which has a wall 6 steps forward. Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing.

Wait, the agent's orientation is key here. Let's reconstruct possible orientations based on the actions taken. The first few observations had the agent turning left each time. Let's assume the agent starts facing north. After turning left once, they face west. The second observation shows a wall 5 steps forward (west) and a wall 1 step right (south). Then turning left again would face south. The next observation shows a wall 6 steps forward (south), a wall 2 steps left (east), and the blue box 1 step right (north) and 4 steps forward (south). Wait, this is getting a bit tangled. Maybe the agent is facing south now. If the blue box is 1 step right (east) and 4 steps forward (south), that would place it southeast from the agent's current position. But there's a wall 6 steps forward (south), so the agent can't go straight south. The blue box is east and south, but the agent can't move south past the wall. Therefore, the agent needs to turn right to face east, then move forward, but there's a wall 2 steps left (west). Wait, the current observation says a wall 2 steps left, which if the agent is facing south, left would be west. So moving west 2 steps is blocked, but moving east would be possible. But the blue box is to the east and south. If the agent turns right (now facing east), then moves forward, but they need to go south-east. However, moving forward when facing east would take them east, not south. Maybe the agent needs to turn around. Wait, after turning right, facing east. If they turn right again, they'd face south. Then maybe move forward 4 steps, but there's a wall 6 steps forward in the original direction (north). Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me try to map out possible positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the agent needs to first pick up the blue box. But to do that, they need to be adjacent to it. The current observation says the blue box is 1 step right and 4 steps forward. So the agent is 4 steps away forward and 1 step to the left of the blue box. If the agent turns right (so facing east), then moves forward 4 steps, but there's a wall 2 steps left (which would be west if facing east). Wait, maybe the walls are in different directions based on the agent's orientation. This is tricky without knowing the agent's current facing direction.

Looking at the latest observation: walls 6 forward, 2 left, and the blue box is 1 right and 4 forward. If the agent is facing north, then forward is north, left is west. So the walls are 6 steps north, 2 steps west. The blue box is 1 step east and 4 steps north. So the agent is positioned somewhere south of the blue box, 4 steps away north, 1 step west. To reach the blue box, the agent needs to move east 1 step and north 4 steps. But moving north is blocked by a wall 6 steps away. Therefore, the agent can't go straight north. So they need to adjust their direction. If they turn right (now facing east), then move forward 1 step to the east (which gets them to the blue box's x-coordinate), but then they need to move north 4 steps. However, moving north from there would still hit the wall. Wait, but the blue box is at 1 step right and 4 steps forward from the agent's current position. If the agent is facing north, then right is east. So the blue box is east 1, north 4. But the agent's current position has a wall 6 steps north, which would block any path north. That suggests that maybe the blue box is not directly north but in another direction. Perhaps the agent's orientation is different.

Alternatively, maybe the agent is facing east. Then forward would be east, left would be north. The walls are 6 steps forward (east) and 2 steps left (north). The blue box is 1 step right (south) and 4 steps forward (east). So the agent is 4 steps west of the blue box, 1 step north. To reach the blue box, the agent needs to go south 1 step and east 4 steps. But moving east is blocked by a wall 6 steps away. Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe the agent needs to toggle or pick up the blue box first, but they can't get to it because of the walls. Wait, but the problem says the goal is to go to a blue box after picking up a blue box. So maybe the blue box they need to pick up is somewhere else, and then go to this one. But in the current observation, there's only one blue box mentioned. This is a bit unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the agent has already picked up a blue box in a previous step, and now needs to go to another blue box. But in the current observation, only one blue box is present. The user's goal is a bit ambiguous here. Maybe the correct approach is to first pick up the blue box, then move to where the other blue box is. But how to do that when the current observation only shows one blue box. Maybe the agent needs to navigate around the walls to reach the blue box, pick it up, and then proceed. Let's consider the possible actions.

The agent's current position has a wall 6 steps forward, 2 steps left, and a blue box 1 step right and 4 steps forward. The agent needs to reach the blue box. To do that, they need to be adjacent to it. The blue box is at 1 step right and 4 steps forward. So the agent is 4 steps away forward and 1 step left of the blue box. If the agent turns right (to face east), then moves forward 4 steps, but there's a wall 6 steps forward (east). Wait, that can't be. Maybe the agent's forward direction is different. If the agent is facing south, then forward is south, left is east. The walls are 6 steps south and 2 steps east. The blue box is 1 step right (east) and 4 steps forward (south). So the agent is 4 steps north of the blue box, 1 step west. To reach the blue box, they need to go east 1 step and south 4 steps. Moving south 4 steps would hit the wall 6 steps south. So that's blocked. Therefore, the agent needs to find another path. Maybe turn left to face west, then move forward to go west, but there's a wall 2 steps left (which would be north if facing west). Wait, this is getting too confusing without knowing the agent's exact orientation.

Alternatively, maybe the agent should first pick up the blue box even if it's not immediately clear how to get to the destination after that. But to pick up the blue box, the agent needs to be adjacent to it. The current observation says the blue box is 1 step right and 4 steps forward. So the agent is 4 steps away from the blue box in the forward direction and 1 step to the left. Therefore, the agent needs to move closer. But there's a wall 6 steps forward, which blocks that path. So perhaps the agent needs to turn right to face a direction where they can move towards the blue box without hitting the wall. For example, if the agent turns right (to face east), then moves forward, but there's a wall 6 steps east. That doesn't help. If the agent turns left twice (to face south), then moves forward, but there's a wall 6 steps south. Hmm. Alternatively, turn around (turn right twice) to face north, but that's where the wall is. This seems like a dead end.

Wait, maybe the agent is supposed to toggle or interact with something else first. The tips mention that once the desired object is in front, use toggle. But in this case, the blue box is not in front; it's diagonally. The agent needs to face a direction where the blue box is in front. For example, if the agent turns right twice (facing south), then the blue box is to the east and south. But moving south is blocked. Alternatively, turn right once (facing east), then the blue box is to the south and east. Still blocked. Maybe the agent needs to move in a different way. Wait, but the agent can't move forward because of the wall. So perhaps the only option is to turn left or right to find a direction where they can move towards the blue box without hitting the wall. Let's see.

If the agent turns left (facing west), then the walls are 2 steps left (north) and 6 steps forward (west). The blue box is 1 step east (right) and 4 steps forward (west). So from facing west, the blue box is 1 step east and 4 steps west. Wait, that doesn't make sense. If facing west, forward is west. The blue box is 1 step right (east) and 4 steps forward (west), which would be behind the agent. That can't be right. Maybe the coordinates are relative. The observation says ""a blue box 1 step right and 4 steps forward."" So regardless of the agent's facing direction, the blue box is 1 step to the agent's right and 4 steps forward. So if the agent is facing north, right is east, forward is north. So the blue box is east 1, north 4. But the wall is 6 steps north, so the path is blocked. If the agent turns right (east), then the blue box is south 1 and east 4. But moving east 4 steps would hit the wall 6 steps east. Hmm. This is really confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to first drop the object they're holding to clear the way, but the problem states the goal is to pick up a blue box first. Wait, the agent's goal is to go to a blue box after picking it up. So perhaps the agent has already picked up a blue box in a previous step, and now needs to go to the location of another blue box. But in the current observation, there's only one blue box. Maybe the other blue box is out of sight, and the agent needs to navigate around the walls to reach it. However, based on the current observation, the agent is blocked in all directions except maybe turning.

Looking back at the previous actions, the agent has been turning left multiple times. Maybe they need to continue turning left to find a direction where they can move forward towards the blue box. For example, if after turning left a few more times, the agent faces a direction where the blue box is in front and within reach. Alternatively, the agent might need to toggle an object to remove a wall, but the problem doesn't mention any other objects besides walls and the blue box.

Wait, the tips mention that once the desired object is in front, use toggle. But the blue box isn't in front; it's diagonally. The agent needs to be adjacent to it to pick up. But how to get there. Maybe the agent should first pick up the blue box even if it's not directly in front, but the game mechanics might require the object to be directly below or in front. The 'pick up' action probably requires the object to be directly below the agent. So the agent needs to be one step above the blue box. Given that the blue box is 1 step right and 4 steps forward, the agent would need to be 4 steps north and 1 step west of the blue box to pick it up (assuming facing north). But there's a wall 6 steps north, so that's impossible. Therefore, the agent must be in a different position.

Alternatively, maybe the agent is supposed to move in a way that allows them to approach the blue box from a different direction. For example, if the agent turns right, then moves forward 2 steps (but there's a wall 2 steps left when facing east?), no. This is really challenging without knowing the agent's exact position and orientation.

Alternatively, maybe the agent should try to pick up the blue box even if it's not directly accessible, but that doesn't make sense. The 'pick up' action likely requires the object to be directly below. Given the current observation, the agent is 4 steps away from the blue box in the forward direction and 1 step to the left. So to get to the blue box, the agent would need to move 4 steps forward and 1 step right. But moving forward is blocked by a wall. Therefore, the agent must find another path. Perhaps by turning right and moving sideways, but the walls are in the way. For example, if the agent turns right (facing east), then moves forward, but there's a wall 6 steps east. So that's blocked. If the agent turns left (facing west), moves forward, but there's a wall 2 steps left (north). So that's also blocked.

In this scenario, the agent is surrounded by walls except maybe by turning around. But turning around would face the original direction with the wall 6 steps forward. So the agent is stuck. The only possible action that doesn't hit a wall would be to turn left or right, but both directions seem blocked when moving forward. However, the current observation doesn't mention any walls in the agent's current facing direction. Wait, the latest observation says a wall 6 steps forward, 2 steps left. So if the agent is facing north, forward is north (wall 6 steps), left is west (no wall mentioned, but the blue box is east). Wait, the blue box is 1 step right and 4 steps forward. If facing north, right is east, forward is north. So the blue box is east 1, north 4. But the wall is 6 steps north, so the path is blocked. Therefore, the agent can't go north. If the agent turns right (east), then forward is east (wall 6 steps). Turn left (west), forward is west (no wall mentioned, but blue box is east). So the agent is stuck. The only possible actions that don't result in a wall are turning left or right, but those don't help in moving towards the blue box. Alternatively, the agent could try to move forward despite the wall, but that's probably not allowed.

Wait, the problem says that it doesn't make sense to repeat the same action if the observation doesn't change. The agent has been turning left multiple times, which might not be effective. Maybe the agent should try turning right instead. In the current observation, turning right would face the agent east, with a wall 6 steps forward (east). So moving forward is blocked. But perhaps toggling an object? There's no mention of any other objects besides walls and the blue box. Toggling might interact with something else, but the description doesn't specify. Maybe the agent needs to pick up the blue box, but can't reach it. This is a dilemma.

Given the confusion, perhaps the best action is to continue turning left to change direction and look for a way around the walls. Alternatively, since the agent's goal is to pick up a blue box and then go to another, maybe they should first pick up the blue box even if they can't see the destination. But without being adjacent, they can't pick it up. Alternatively, maybe the agent has already picked up the blue box in a previous step, and now needs to go to the location indicated in the current observation. But that's unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the agent should 'go forward' even though there's a wall, but that's probably not possible. The actions are likely limited to the ones that don't cause errors. Given all this, the safest action might be to turn left again to change direction and see if there's a path forward. Alternatively, turn right. Let's look at the current observation again: walls 6 forward, 2 left, blue box 1 right and 4 forward. If the agent turns right, facing east, then the blue box is 1 step south and 4 steps east. But moving east is blocked by a wall. If the agent turns left, facing west, the blue box is 1 step east and 4 steps west. So from facing west, moving west 4 steps would reach the blue box, but there's a wall 2 steps left (north), which is irrelevant. Wait, if facing west, left is north. The walls are 6 steps forward (west) and 2 steps left (north). The blue box is 1 step east (right) and 4 steps forward (west). So from facing west, the blue box is 1 step to the right (east) and 4 steps forward (west). Wait, that would mean the blue box","

Observation:

5,turn right,"<reasoning>
Let me try to figure out what I should do here. The goal is to go to a blue box after picking it up, but first, I need to pick it up. Looking at the current observation, there's a wall 5 steps forward, a wall 2 steps left, and a blue box that's 1 step right and 3 steps forward.

The previous actions were turning left multiple times and trying to go forward, but maybe I need to adjust my direction. Over the last few steps, I turned left twice, then right. Let's see, after turning right, maybe I can face a direction where the blue box is accessible.

I need to check where I'm facing. If I turned right from facing left, then I might be facing north. The blue box is 1 step right and 3 forward. So if I'm facing north, right would be east. But there's a wall to the left (2 steps left) which could mean I'm near a corner. The wall 5 steps forward after turning right might be in the north direction.

Wait, maybe I should first turn to face the direction of the blue box. The blue box is to the right (east) and forward (north). If I'm facing north after turning right, then moving forward 3 steps would get me to the blue box, but there's a wall 5 steps forward. That suggests that moving straight north isn't possible. Hmm, maybe I need to adjust my path.

Alternatively, if I turn right again to face east, then move right (east) 1 step to reach the blue box's position. But I need to check if there are walls in that direction. The observation says a wall is 2 steps left, which if I'm facing east, left would be north. So moving east 1 step would be towards the blue box. But maybe there's a wall blocking that path?

Wait, the current observation mentions a wall 2 steps left. If I'm facing north (after the previous right turn), then left is west. But the wall is 2 steps west. The blue box is 1 step east and 3 north. So from my current position, facing north, moving east 1 step would take me to the blue box's x-coordinate, but then I need to move north 3 steps. However, there's a wall 5 steps north, meaning I can't go straight north beyond that. So perhaps the blue box is near that wall.

Wait, maybe the blue box is between me and the wall. Let me visualize the layout. Let's assume the agent starts at (0,0). If there's a wall 5 steps forward (north), then the wall is at (0,5). The blue box is at (1,3), which is 1 step east and 3 north. But if moving north 3 steps from (0,0) gets to (0,3), which is 2 steps away from the wall at (0,5), that's possible. So the path north is clear up to (0,3), then the wall is at (0,5). But the blue box is at (1,3), which is east of (0,3). So to get there, I need to move east 1 step from (0,3) to (1,3). But is there a wall blocking that east move?

The observation says a wall is 2 steps left. If facing north, left is west, so 2 steps west would be (-2,0). That's a different direction. So maybe the east direction is clear. Therefore, the plan could be: turn right to face north, move forward until I hit the wall at (0,5), but wait, the blue box is at (1,3). So maybe I need to face east first. Wait, the blue box is 1 step right (east) and 4 steps forward (north) in previous observations. Now it's 1 step right and 3 forward. So perhaps the agent moved forward a bit.

Wait, the agent's current position might have changed. Let me think step by step.

Previous actions: The user's history shows that the agent turned left multiple times, then right, then faced a situation where it tried to go forward but failed. Now, after the default action of go forward, the observation is a wall 5 steps forward, wall 2 left, and blue box 1 right and 3 forward.

Assuming the agent is facing north after the last right turn. Then, moving forward would hit the wall 5 steps away. But the blue box is to the east (right) and 3 steps forward (north). So maybe the agent should turn right again to face east, move right once to reach the blue box's x-coordinate, then move north towards it. But moving north from there would require going past the wall? Wait, no. The wall is 5 steps forward from the original position, which if the agent is now at (1,0) after moving east once, then moving north 3 steps would take them to (1,3), which is the blue box's location. But the wall is 5 steps forward from the original position (0,0), so at (0,5). So from (1,0), moving north 5 steps would reach (1,5), but the wall is at (0,5). That doesn't block the agent's path east, but the blue box is at (1,3), which is reachable.

Therefore, the correct sequence would be: turn right to face east, move right once to (1,0), then turn north (another right turn?), wait. If facing east, turning right would face south, which isn't helpful. Maybe the agent needs to adjust direction properly.

Alternatively, if the agent is facing north, turn right to face east, move east 1 step to (1,0), then turn north (another right turn to face north again?), then move forward 3 steps to (1,3), which is the blue box's location. But moving forward from (1,0) 3 steps north would reach (1,3), avoiding the wall at (0,5) because that's on the west side.

So the actions needed are: turn right (from facing north to east), move forward 1 step to reach (1,0), then turn right again to face north, move forward 3 steps to (1,3), then pick up the blue box.

But in the current observation, the blue box is 1 step right and 3 steps forward. So if the agent is facing north, right is east. Moving right once gets to the blue box's x position. Then moving forward 3 steps would reach the blue box. So after moving right, the agent is at (1,0), facing north. Moving forward 3 steps would take them to (1,3), where the blue box is. Then pick up.

But in the current observation, after the default go forward, the agent is facing north, and the blue box is 1 right and 3 forward. So the next step should be to turn right to face east, move right once, then face north again and move forward 3 times. However, the agent must pick up the box once it's there.

But the current observation is after the default go forward, so the agent might have moved towards the wall but then there's a blue box nearby. Wait, the latest observation says the blue box is 1 step right and 3 forward. If the agent is facing north, then right is east. So moving east 1 step would get to the blue box's x-coordinate, then moving forward 3 steps north would reach it. So the correct action now is to turn right to face east, then move forward. Wait, but the blue box is 1 step right (east) and 3 steps forward (north). So first, turn right to face east, move forward 1 step to reach the blue box's x position, then turn north (another right turn), then move forward 3 steps. But in the current observation, after moving forward (default action), the agent is facing north, and the blue box is 1 step right and 3 forward. So the immediate next action should be to turn right (to face east), then move forward 1 step to get to the blue box's location. Once there, pick up.

But the agent hasn't picked up the box yet. The goal is to go to the blue box after picking it up, but first, pick it up. So the sequence is: reach the blue box, pick it up, then go to the desired location (which isn't specified, just ""go to a blue box after picking it up""). Wait, the original goal is to go to a blue box after picking it up. So the agent must first pick up the blue box, then go to it? That seems redundant. Maybe the actual goal is to pick up the blue box and then move to it, but that doesn't make sense. Probably, the correct interpretation is that the agent must first pick up the blue box and then move to another location (not specified), but the problem says ""go to a blue box after you pick up a blue box"". Maybe the intended meaning is to pick up the blue box and then bring it to a certain place, but the problem statement is a bit unclear. However, based on the observations, the agent needs to pick up the blue box first, then perhaps move to it. But since the blue box is already in the agent's vicinity, once picked up, the agent can move to wherever the target is. But the problem might simply require picking up the blue box and then being at its location. 

Assuming that, the steps are: reach the blue box, pick it up, then maybe move somewhere else. But the current observation shows the blue box is 1 step right and 3 forward. So the agent needs to navigate to that position, pick it up, and then perhaps go to another location. However, the problem statement doesn't specify a final location beyond picking up and going to the blue box. So maybe the task is just to pick up the blue box and then be in its location. 

In the current observation, the agent is facing north, with a wall 5 steps forward, a wall 2 steps left (which would be west if facing north), and the blue box 1 step east and 3 steps north. So the agent should turn right to face east, move forward 1 step to reach the blue box's x-coordinate, then turn north (another right turn) and move forward 3 steps to reach the blue box. Once there, pick it up. 

But the current action needs to be chosen. The previous default action was go forward, which might have moved the agent closer. Now, the agent is facing north, and the blue box is 1 right and 3 forward. So the next step should be to turn right to face east, then move forward. 

So the correct action here is to turn right. After turning right, facing east, then move forward 1 step. But the agent needs to choose between turn left, right, go forward, pick up, drop, toggle. 

In the current observation, the blue box is not in front of the agent; it's to the right and forward. So the agent needs to reorient itself. Therefore, the first action should be to turn right to face east, then move forward. 

But the available actions are turn left, turn right, go forward, etc. So the immediate action needed is to turn right to face east. Once faced east, the next action would be go forward. But the agent must choose one action at a time. 

So in the current observation, the agent is facing north, blue box is 1 east, 3 north. So to get there, turn right (to face east), then move forward. So the next action should be turn right. Then, after that, go forward. 

But the agent must choose the next action based on the current observation. Since the blue box is not directly in front, the agent needs to adjust direction. Therefore, the correct action here is to turn right.

The goal is to go to a blue box after picking up a blue box. Right now, the agent needs to first pick up a blue box and then go to another blue box.

Looking at the current observation, there are two blue boxes. One is 3 steps left and 1 step forward, and another is 1 step left and 4 steps forward. The agent is probably facing a direction where these boxes are located. 

First, I need to figure out how to reach one of the blue boxes. The agent needs to navigate around the walls. The wall in front is 5 steps, and on the right is 2 steps. So maybe the agent is facing north, and the walls are blocking the north and east directions.

The first blue box is 3 steps to the left and 1 step forward. If the agent turns left (west), then moves forward one step, they can reach the first blue box. But the second blue box is 1 step left and 4 steps forward. That would require turning left and moving forward more steps. However, picking up the first blue box might be easier, as it's closer in the forward direction after turning.

Alternatively, maybe the agent should first move towards the second blue box. But the path might be blocked by walls. The agent needs to avoid walls. The observation shows walls in front and to the right, so turning left (west) might be the way to go. 

Wait, the agent needs to pick up a blue box first. Let's prioritize getting one. The first blue box is 3 steps left and 1 step forward. So, if the agent turns left (west), then moves forward once, they can reach it. Once there, they can pick it up. Then, they need to go to the other blue box, which is 1 step left and 4 steps forward. But after picking up the first box, do they need to drop it somewhere? The goal is to go to a blue box after picking up one. So maybe after picking up the first, they just need to navigate to the second one.

But the agent needs to make sure they can reach the second blue box after picking up the first. Let's map this out. If the agent turns left, moves forward once to get the first blue box, picks it up, then turns around (since turning right from west would face south, but the second box is north?), no, perhaps the directions need to be adjusted. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent should turn left, move forward until they reach the first blue box. Once picked up, then turn right (back to original direction) and move forward four steps to reach the second blue box. But there's a wall 5 steps forward, which might block that path. Wait, the wall is 5 steps forward in the original direction. So if the agent is facing north, there's a wall 5 steps north. If after picking up the first box (which is west and north), then turning east (right) would face the wall again. Hmm, maybe the agent needs to adjust their direction differently.

Alternatively, perhaps after picking up the first blue box, the agent should turn around (180 degrees) to face south, then move forward to avoid the wall. But the second blue box is to the left and four steps forward from the original position. Maybe this is getting complicated. 

The key steps are: pick up a blue box, then go to another blue box. The agent must first pick up one. So the immediate action should be to navigate to a blue box and pick it up. The first blue box is 3 left and 1 forward. To get there: turn left (west), move forward once. Then pick up. Then from there, the agent would be facing west, so to get to the second blue box (1 left and 4 forward from original position), which would be south-west direction? Maybe the agent needs to turn around and move. 

But perhaps the easiest path is to first get the first blue box. So the actions would be: turn left, go forward, pick up. Then, once picked up, navigate to the second blue box. However, after picking up, the agent needs to go to another blue box. The problem says ""go to a blue box after you pick up a blue box."" So after picking up one, just move to any blue box, even if it's the same one? But there are two here. 

So the immediate action is to get the first blue box. Therefore, the agent should turn left, go forward once, then pick up. The current observation shows the blue box is 3 steps left and 1 forward. Wait, if the agent is facing north, ""left"" would be west. So 3 steps west and 1 step north would be the position. But how does the agent's orientation affect this? 

Alternatively, maybe the agent's current direction is such that ""left"" is a different direction. But without knowing the agent's facing direction, it's a bit ambiguous. However, based on previous interactions, the agent has been turning left to navigate around walls. Looking at the history, in previous steps, turning left helped avoid walls. 

In the last observation, after turning right, the agent faced a wall again. Now, the current observation has walls in front (5 steps) and right (2 steps). So the agent is probably facing a direction where forward is blocked by a wall. The two blue boxes are located to the left and forward-left. 

So to reach the blue box that's 3 steps left and 1 forward, the agent needs to turn left (west), move forward once. Then pick up. After that, they can navigate to the other blue box. 

Therefore, the next action should be to turn left to face the direction where the blue box is, then move forward. But the agent needs to pick up the blue box. So first, turn left, then go forward, then pick up. But the current observation hasn't shown the agent holding anything, so they need to pick up first. 

So the first action would be to turn left to align with the blue box's direction. Then move forward once to reach it. Then pick up. 

So the next action is turn left. Wait, but in the current observation, the agent is already facing a direction where turning left would help. Let me check the previous steps. 

In the previous observations, the agent was turning left multiple times to avoid walls. For example, when the observation was a wall 5 steps forward and 1 step right, the agent turned left. Then again, in another observation, turned left again. Then turned right. Now, the current observation has walls 5 steps forward and 2 steps right, with two blue boxes. 

Assuming that turning left again would face the agent towards the blue box that's 3 steps left and 1 forward. So the next action should be turn left, then go forward, then pick up. 

But the user is asking for the next action based on the current observation. So the current observation is:

a wall 5 steps forward
a wall 2 steps right
a blue box 3 steps left and 1 step forward
a blue box 1 step left and 4 steps forward

So the agent needs to decide between turning left, right, forward, pick up, drop, or toggle. But to interact with a blue box, the agent must be adjacent to it and use toggle, but the description says that once the desired object is in front, use toggle. However, the blue boxes are not directly in front, but at certain positions. 

Wait, the possible actions include 'toggle' to interact with the object in front. So to pick up a blue box, the agent must be facing it directly and use 'toggle'? Or is 'pick up' the action to pick up the object below you, which would be under the agent's current position. But the blue boxes are in front. 

Looking back at the action descriptions:

pick up: pick up the object below you,
toggle: manipulate the object in front of you.

So 'pick up' is for the object directly beneath the agent, while 'toggle' is for the object in front. So if the blue box is in front of the agent, the agent needs to toggle it to pick up? Or is there a confusion here. 

Wait, maybe the blue box is on the ground in front of the agent, so 'pick up' would work. But the description says 'pick up the object below you', which would be the object at your current position. So perhaps the blue boxes are on the ground, and to pick one up, the agent must be adjacent to it and use 'pick up'. But the problem is that the blue boxes are some steps away. 

Wait, the actions are 'go forward' to move one step. So the agent needs to move into the position of the blue box, then 'pick up'. But the blue boxes are 3 steps left and 1 forward, so the agent needs to move there. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent can use 'toggle' to interact with objects in front, even if they are not immediately at their current position. But according to the tips, once the desired object is in front, use 'toggle'. So perhaps the agent needs to face the blue box and then toggle to pick it up. 

But how does the agent get the blue box into their line of sight? For example, the first blue box is 3 steps left and 1 forward. If the agent turns left (west), then moves forward once, they would be facing the direction where the blue box is 2 steps away? Or maybe the agent needs to adjust their position. 

This is a bit confusing. The key is that the agent must pick up a blue box before going to another. So the steps are: navigate to a blue box, pick it up, then navigate to another blue box. 

Given that, the agent needs to first reach a blue box. The closest one is 3 steps left and 1 forward. To get there, the agent needs to turn left (west), move forward once, then perhaps move left twice more? Or is the 'left' direction in the observation meaning something else. 

Wait, the observation says the blue box is 3 steps left and 1 step forward. So if the agent is facing north, 'left' would be west. So 3 steps west and 1 step north. To get there, the agent needs to turn left (west), then move forward once (north), but that would only be 1 step forward. Wait, maybe the coordinates are relative. 

Alternatively, the agent's current position is the origin, and the blue box is at (-3, 1) if facing north. To get there, the agent would need to turn left (west), then move forward three times and one step north? But movement is one step at a time. 

This is getting complicated. The safest approach is to follow the previous pattern where turning left helps avoid walls and eventually reach the blue box. 

In the current observation, the walls are 5 steps forward and 2 steps right. The blue boxes are to the left and forward-left. So turning left (west) would face the agent away from the wall in front (which is 5 steps north). Then moving forward would take them towards the blue box that's 3 steps west and 1 north. 

But how to reach that exact position? The agent needs to turn left, move forward once (to reduce the forward distance to the blue box from 1 step), then turn another direction? 

Alternatively, after turning left, the agent is facing west. The blue box is 3 steps west and 1 step north. So from there, the agent would need to move west three times and north once. But moving north would be forward, but there's a wall 5 steps forward. So maybe the agent can't move north directly. 

This suggests that the agent might need to adjust their path differently. Perhaps after turning left, move forward once (reducing the forward distance to the blue box from 1 to 0), then turn north (which would be right from the west direction), but that's facing south? Wait, if the agent is facing west, turning right would face south. 

This is getting too confusing without knowing the agent's exact orientation. However, based on the previous interactions, the agent has been turning left to navigate around walls, so perhaps continuing that pattern is the way to go. 

The current observation shows a blue box 3 steps left and 1 forward. If the agent turns left, they can face the direction where moving forward once would get them closer to the blue box. Then, after that, pick it up. 

So the next action should be turn left to face the correct direction, then go forward, then pick up. 

But the user is asking for the next action based on the current observation. So the immediate action is to turn left to align with the blue box's position. Then, in the next step, move forward. 

Therefore, the chosen action is turn left.

Let's tackle this navigation problem step by step. The goal is to pick up a blue box and then go to another blue box. First, I need to make sure I understand the current observation provided.

The observation states:
- There's a wall 5 steps forward.
- A wall 2 steps to the left.
- A blue box 1 step to the right and 3 steps forward.

Previously, the agent tried turning left and then right but ended up facing a dead end. The last valid action defaulted to ""go forward,"" but now the observation shows the blue box is closer. Let's visualize the agent's position and the surrounding environment.

Assuming the agent is facing a certain direction, let's map out the possible directions. The walls are 5 steps forward and 2 steps left. The blue box is 1 step right and 3 steps forward. If the agent is facing north, then ""forward"" would be north, ""right"" would be east, and ""left"" would be west.

In the current observation, there's a wall 5 steps north (forward) and a wall 2 steps west (left). The blue box is located 1 step east (right) and 3 steps north (forward). So the agent's current position is somewhere where moving forward 5 steps hits a wall, moving left 2 steps also hits a wall, and the nearest blue box is diagonally northeast but a bit east and more north.

The agent's previous actions were turning left multiple times and then right, which might have reoriented them. But the latest observation shows the blue box is 1 step right and 3 forward. So perhaps the agent needs to adjust their direction to face northeast? 

Since there's a wall directly north (5 steps forward), the agent can't go straight north. The blue box is 3 steps forward and 1 step right. So maybe the agent should first turn right to face east, then move forward until they can turn north? But wait, moving east might lead to another wall. Let's check the original observations again.

In the previous steps, the walls were at different positions. For instance, after turning left, the walls shifted. But now, according to the current observation, walls are 5 forward and 2 left. The blue box is 1 right and 3 forward. 

If the agent turns right (east), then moving forward might not hit a wall immediately. Let me consider the agent's direction. Suppose the agent was initially facing north. After turning left multiple times, they might now be facing a different direction. Alternatively, perhaps after some turning and moving, the agent's orientation has changed. 

Alternatively, if the agent is facing east, then moving forward would be east, but there's a wall 2 steps to the left (which would be north). Wait, that doesn't align. Maybe I need to clarify the directions based on the agent's current facing direction. 

This is a bit confusing. Let's break it down:

Assume the agent starts facing north. The initial walls were 1 step forward (north) and 2 steps right (east). Then the agent turned left (now facing west), and subsequent observations showed walls in different positions. But the current observation shows a wall 5 steps forward (north again?), a wall 2 steps left (west?), and a blue box 1 step right (east) and 3 steps forward (north). 

Wait, that suggests the agent might have turned around. If the agent turned left multiple times, say three times (west, south, east), then facing east, but then walls would be in different directions. This is getting a bit tangled. Maybe it's better to approach this systematically.

The agent's goal is to pick up a blue box and then go to another blue box. The current task is to pick up the blue box. The blue box is 1 step right and 3 steps forward. 

Given the current observation, the agent needs to navigate to the blue box. Since there's a wall 5 steps forward, the agent can't go straight north. The blue box is 3 steps north and 1 step east. So the agent needs to first turn east (right) to face east, move forward until they can turn north. But moving east might not be possible if there's a wall. Alternatively, maybe the agent should turn right (east), move forward some steps, then turn north. But the problem is the walls are in the way. 

Wait, in the current observation, there's a wall 2 steps left. If the agent is facing north, left would be west. So 2 steps west is a wall. The blue box is 1 east and 3 north. So the agent needs to get east of the wall. But if moving east is possible, then the agent could go east, then north. However, the wall 5 steps forward (north) is still a problem. But the blue box is only 3 steps north from the current position. So maybe the agent can go east, then north 3 steps. But how? If moving east is possible without hitting a wall, then that's the way. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to turn right (east), move forward until they can't, then turn north. But the observation doesn't mention walls east of the current position. The only walls mentioned are 5 forward (north) and 2 left (west). So perhaps moving east is possible. If the agent turns right (east), then they can move forward. Let's say they move east until they can't, then turn north. But how far east can they go? The observation doesn't specify walls east of the current position, only 2 steps left (west) and 5 forward (north). So moving east might be clear. 

Therefore, the agent should first turn right to face east. Then move forward until they reach the blue box's position, which is 1 step east and 3 north. But since moving east first, then north 3 steps. Wait, the blue box is 1 east and 3 north. If the agent turns right (east), moves 1 step east, then turns north (since there's a wall 5 steps forward, which would be north now), but the blue box is only 3 steps north. However, moving north 3 steps from that position would reach the blue box. But there's a wall 5 steps forward, so the agent can't go beyond 5 steps? That doesn't make sense unless the wall is at 5 steps forward from the original position. 

This is getting a bit confusing. Maybe the agent needs to first adjust their direction. Let's think again. The current observation shows the blue box is 1 step right and 3 steps forward. Assuming the agent is facing north, right is east. So to reach the blue box, the agent needs to go 3 steps north and 1 step east. But there's a wall 5 steps north, so the agent can't go beyond that. But the blue box is 3 steps north, which is within the 5 steps. Therefore, the agent needs to find a path to go 3 north and 1 east. 

If the agent is facing north, the wall is 5 steps ahead. The blue box is 3 steps ahead and 1 step right. So the agent needs to turn right (east) to face east, move 1 step east (since the blue box is 1 east), then turn north (but facing east, turning north would be a left turn), and move 3 steps north. However, moving north from the new position (1 east) would be 3 steps, but the original wall is 5 steps north from the starting position. So if the agent is now 1 east, moving north 3 steps would still be within the 5 steps, so no wall in the way. 

Therefore, the sequence would be:
1. Turn right (east)
2. Go forward 1 step (east)
3. Turn left (north)
4. Go forward 3 steps (north)

But the agent needs to pick up the blue box. So after moving to the blue box's position, they would use 'pick up'. 

However, in the current observation, the agent hasn't yet picked up any box. The goal is to first pick up a blue box. So the agent must reach the blue box, then pick it up. 

Looking at the current observation, the blue box is 1 step right and 3 steps forward. If the agent is facing north, they need to turn right (east), move 1 step, then turn left (north), move 3 steps. But how does that align with the walls? 

Alternatively, maybe the agent is facing a different direction. Suppose the agent turned left multiple times and is now facing west. Then, the wall 2 steps left would be south. The blue box is 1 step right (east) and 3 steps forward (west). That doesn't make sense because moving forward would be west, and the blue box is west but also east? That can't be. So perhaps the agent's facing direction is north. 

Given the confusion in directions, perhaps the safest action is to turn right (east) to face the direction where the blue box is partially located (1 step right). Then, move forward to get closer. 

In the current observation, the agent's immediate goal is to reach the blue box. Since the blue box is 1 step right and 3 forward, turning right (east) would allow the agent to move towards the east, reducing the east component. Then, after turning right, moving forward would help get closer. 

Alternatively, turning left might not be helpful here. The agent needs to adjust their direction to face towards the blue box. Since the blue box is northeast of the agent's current position (if facing north), the agent should turn east (right) to face northeast, then move forward. 

But the wall is 5 steps forward (north), so moving straight north isn't possible. However, moving east first, then north would avoid the wall. 

So, the next action should be to turn right to face east, then move forward. But the agent needs to decide between turning right or another action. 

Looking at the previous steps, the agent tried turning left multiple times, which might have reoriented them. Now, the correct approach is to turn right to face the direction where the blue box is located (east), then proceed. 

Therefore, the chosen action should be 'turn right' to adjust direction, followed by 'go forward' steps. But in the current observation, the immediate next step is to decide between the listed actions. The agent needs to pick one action. Since the goal is to reach the blue box, turning right seems like the correct initial step to face the right direction. 

So, the output should be '<|ACTION|>turn right<|END|>'.

Let's see. My goal is to go to a blue box after picking up a blue box. There are two blue boxes in the current observation. ""a blue box 3 steps left and 1 step forward"" and ""a blue box 1 step left and 4 steps forward"".

First, I need to pick up one of the blue boxes, then go to the other one. But right now, I have to figure out how to reach either of them. Let me look at the layout based on the observations.

The walls are: 5 steps forward and 2 steps right. So, if I'm facing a certain direction, the walls are in those positions. Let's try to visualize the possible directions I might be facing. Previous actions were turning left, right, etc. But since I don't have the full history, I'll have to infer based on current observations.

The first blue box is 3 steps left and 1 step forward. The second is 1 step left and 4 steps forward. If I'm facing north, for example, then moving forward would take me north. But with walls 5 steps forward and 2 steps right, maybe my current facing direction is such that moving forward hits a wall after 5 steps, and moving right hits a wall after 2 steps.

If the current facing direction is north, then moving forward 5 steps would hit a wall. To get to the first blue box (3 left and 1 forward), perhaps I need to turn west (left) and then move forward 1 step, then move left 3 steps. But wait, the blue box is 3 steps left and 1 forward. If I'm facing north, left would be west. So moving west 3 steps and north 1 step would get there. But moving west 3 steps would require no walls in the way. However, the observation mentions a wall 2 steps right. If right is east, then moving east 2 steps would hit a wall, but moving west isn't mentioned, so maybe there's no wall there.

Alternatively, if the blue box is 3 steps left and 1 forward, maybe I need to adjust my direction. Let's think step by step. The agent needs to pick up a blue box first. The two blue boxes are in different positions. Let's consider the closest one first. The second blue box is 1 step left and 4 steps forward. If I can get to that one, pick it up, then go to the other. But how?

Alternatively, maybe go to the first blue box (3 left, 1 forward), pick it up, then move to the second. But the problem is navigating around the walls.

Wait, the walls are 5 steps forward and 2 steps right. Let's see. If I turn right (east), moving 2 steps would hit a wall. So east is blocked after 2 steps. Moving forward 5 steps is blocked. So possible directions are west and south? Because left (west) isn't mentioned as having a wall, and south might be open.

But how to navigate to the blue boxes. The first blue box is 3 steps left (west) and 1 forward. If I'm facing north, left is west. So moving west 3 steps and then north 1 step. But moving west 3 steps would require passing through those steps without walls. Since the only walls mentioned are forward and right, it's possible that west is open.

Alternatively, maybe the agent is facing a different direction. Let's try a different approach. The agent needs to pick up a blue box first. Let's think about which blue box is reachable first.

The first blue box is 3 steps left and 1 forward. The second is 1 step left and 4 forward. If the agent turns left (west), then moves forward 1 step (which would be the first blue box's forward direction). But the blue box is 3 steps left and 1 forward. Wait, maybe the agent's current direction is such that left is west, so moving left would be west. Then moving forward 1 step would be north? Hmm, this is getting confusing without knowing the agent's exact orientation.

Alternatively, the agent could need to turn right to face a different direction. For example, if the agent turns right (east), but there's a wall 2 steps east. So that's blocked. If the agent turns left (west), then maybe they can move west towards the blue boxes.

Alternatively, let's consider that the agent needs to first pick up a blue box. Let's say the agent moves towards the blue box that is 1 step left and 4 forward. To get there, they might need to turn left (west), then move forward 4 steps. But there's a wall 5 steps forward in the current direction. Wait, the walls are in the direction the agent is currently facing. So if the agent turns left (west), then the walls would be 5 steps forward (which would be north-west?) and 2 steps right (east?). Not sure.

This is getting a bit tangled. Maybe the best approach is to keep turning left or right to reorient and find a path towards the blue boxes. Since the previous actions were turning left multiple times, maybe turning right now to change direction could help.

Looking at the current observation: walls at 5 forward and 2 right, and two blue boxes. The agent hasn't picked up any box yet, so the priority is to pick up one. Let's focus on the closer blue box. The one at 1 step left and 4 forward might be closer if the agent can navigate there.

To reach the blue box at 1 left and 4 forward, assuming the agent is facing north:

- Turn left (west), then move forward 4 steps. But moving west 1 step would be left, then forward 4 steps. But there's a wall 5 steps forward in the original direction. If the agent turns left (west), their forward direction is now west. So moving forward 4 steps west would reach the blue box at 1 left (which is west) and 4 forward (which is west). Wait, no, the blue box is 1 step left (west) and 4 steps forward (west) from the agent's current position. So if the agent turns left (west), then moves forward 4 steps, they would reach the blue box. But there's a wall 5 steps forward in the original direction (north), but after turning left, the wall in the new forward direction (west) isn't mentioned. So maybe that's possible.

Alternatively, if the agent turns right (east), but there's a wall 2 steps east, so they can't go that way. So turning left seems better.

So the plan would be: turn left (to face west), then move forward 4 steps to reach the blue box. Then pick it up. Then navigate to the other blue box.

But in the current observation, after turning left, the agent would face west. Then moving forward 4 steps (since the blue box is 4 steps forward in that direction). But how to confirm that there are no walls in between. The observation doesn't mention walls in the west direction, only forward and right. So assuming that moving west is possible.

Therefore, the action would be to turn left, then go forward multiple times. But the agent needs to execute each action step by step. Since the previous actions were turning left, maybe the agent is now facing a different direction. Let's say after turning left once, the agent faces west. Then moving forward 4 steps would get to the blue box. But each time, the agent can only move one step at a time.

But in the current observation, the blue box is 1 step left and 4 forward. If the agent is facing north, left is west. So to get to the blue box, they need to move west 1 step and north 4 steps. But that would require turning left (west), moving forward 4 steps (north?), which doesn't make sense. Wait, this is confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the agent is facing a direction where left is south. But that's just guessing. Without knowing the agent's orientation, it's challenging. 

Another approach: The agent needs to pick up a blue box. The closest one is 1 step left and 4 forward. To get there, the agent should first turn to face the direction where the blue box is. For example, if the blue box is to the left and forward, the agent needs to turn left (to face west) and then move forward. But the exact steps depend on the agent's current direction.

Alternatively, the agent could toggle the blue box if it's below them, but in the observation, the blue boxes are at certain distances, so they must be in front or to the sides.

Given the uncertainty about the agent's orientation, the safest action might be to continue turning left to change direction and look for a path towards the blue boxes. Alternatively, try moving forward if possible, but there's a wall 5 steps forward, so moving forward isn't feasible unless the agent is facing a different direction.

Wait, in the current observation, the walls are 5 steps forward and 2 steps right. So if the agent turns left (west), their new forward direction would have no mentioned walls, so moving forward is possible. Alternatively, turning right (east) is blocked after 2 steps.

So the agent should turn left to face west, then move forward towards the blue box that's 1 step left (which would be the same direction, west) and 4 steps forward. But how does that align?

If the agent is facing west after turning left, then moving forward 4 steps would take them 4 steps west. The blue box is 1 step left (west) and 4 steps forward (west), so that would mean the blue box is 5 steps west? Wait, that doesn't match the observation. The observation says the blue box is 1 step left and 4 steps forward. So perhaps the agent needs to adjust their direction.

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to first move forward a bit, then turn. For example, if the agent moves forward once, then turns left, then moves towards the blue box.

But given the current observation, the walls are 5 steps forward and 2 steps right, so moving forward is only possible if the agent is facing a direction where the wall isn't in the way. If the agent turns left (west), then their forward direction is west, and there's no mentioned wall, so moving forward is possible.

So steps could be:

1. Turn left (to face west)
2. Go forward 4 steps to reach the blue box at 1 step left (which is same direction) and 4 steps forward. Wait, but the blue box is 1 step left and 4 forward. If facing west, left would be south. Hmm, this is getting too confusing without knowing the agent's orientation.

Maybe the best action now is to turn left again to change direction, as the previous actions were turning left and the agent hasn't picked up any box yet. Alternatively, try moving forward if possible. But moving forward would hit a wall in the current direction.

Wait, the current observation says walls are 5 steps forward and 2 steps right. So if the agent is facing north, moving forward 5 steps would hit a wall. Moving right (east) 2 steps would hit a wall. Moving left (west) or south isn't mentioned, so those directions might be open.

Therefore, to avoid walls, the agent should turn left (west) or right (east, but blocked). So turning left (west) is better. Then move forward towards the blue box that's 1 step left (west) and 4 steps forward (west). Wait, but if facing west, left would be south. So maybe that's not the right direction.

This is really tricky without knowing the agent's current orientation. Given that, the safest bet might be to continue turning left to reorient, as the previous actions were turning left and the agent might be circling. Alternatively, try toggling, but the blue boxes are not in front of the agent; they are at certain distances.

Another possibility: The agent is facing north, with walls to the north (5 steps forward) and east (2 steps right). The blue boxes are to the west and south. To reach the blue box that's 1 step left (west) and 4 forward (north), but that's blocked by the wall 5 steps forward. So that's not possible. Therefore, the other blue box at 3 steps left (west) and 1 forward (north) might be reachable by turning west, moving forward 1 step, then left 3 steps. But again, orientation is key.

Alternatively, the agent could turn right (south), but there's no wall mentioned in that direction. If the agent turns right (south), their forward direction is south. The blue boxes are at certain positions relative to that. The first blue box is 3 steps left (which would be east) and 1 forward (south). The second is 1 step left (east) and 4 forward (south). But moving south 4 steps to reach the second blue box. However, the agent would have to navigate around any walls. Since there's a wall 5 steps forward in the original direction (north), but after turning south, forward is south with no mentioned walls. So moving south 4 steps would reach the second blue box (1 step left and 4 forward). If left is east in this new direction, then moving left 1 step (east) and forward 4 steps (south) would get to the blue box.

Wait, if the agent turns right (south), their forward direction is south. The blue box is 1 step left (east) and 4 steps forward (south). So to get there:

1. Turn right (south)
2. Move forward 4 steps (south)
3. Turn left (east)
4. Move forward 1 step (east)

But this would place the agent at the blue box. Then pick it up. But the problem is that the agent needs to pick up a blue box first before going to the other. So this path could work.

Alternatively, after turning right (south), move forward 4 steps, then turn left (east), move 1 step, pick up the box, then go to the other blue box which is 3 steps left (west) and 1 forward (north). But that would require turning around, which might be complicated.

Overall, the best immediate action seems to be turning right to face south, then moving forward towards the blue box. But the agent needs to confirm if that's feasible.

Given the uncertainty, the next logical action after previous left turns might be to turn right to change direction and try to reach the blue box. So the chosen action is ""turn right"".

I need to figure out the next action based on the current observation. Let me look at what's happening here. The observation says there's a wall 2 steps forward and another wall 2 steps to the right. The previous interactions show that the agent has been trying to navigate around walls to reach a blue box. The goal is to pick up a blue box and then go to another blue box.

In the last observations, there were blue boxes in different positions, and the agent was turning left or right to adjust direction. Now, both forward and right have walls. So, moving forward is blocked, turning right is also blocked. What options are left? Let's check the allowed actions again: turn left, turn right, go forward, pick up, drop, toggle.

Since moving forward and turning right are blocked by walls, the possible actions are turn left, pick up, drop, toggle. But wait, the agent is supposed to pick up a blue box first and then go to another. But in the current observation, are there any blue boxes mentioned? Let me check. The current observation only mentions walls. There's no blue box listed here. So the agent might have already picked up a blue box in previous steps, but now needs to move towards the next one. However, since there's a wall blocking the forward path and a wall to the right, the agent can't move straight or turn right. The only direction that's open is turning left. 

But wait, the agent needs to get to another blue box. If the current observation doesn't have any blue boxes, maybe the agent has already picked up the first one and is now looking for the second. However, the presence of walls in all but the left direction might mean the agent needs to navigate around. But given that the last few steps involved turning left and right to adjust direction towards blue boxes, perhaps turning left again is the way to go to find a path. 

Alternatively, if the agent is holding a blue box, maybe they need to drop it? But the goal is to go to a blue box after picking up one. So once you pick up the first blue box, the next step is to navigate to the second blue box. If the current observation shows no blue boxes, perhaps the agent needs to move in a direction that wasn't blocked before. But according to the current observation, forward and right are walls. So the only possible movement is turning left. 

Therefore, the best action here is to turn left, which might open up a new path that wasn't blocked before. Let me confirm. The agent's previous actions involved turning left multiple times to adjust direction towards the blue boxes. Now, with walls in front and right, turning left would change the agent's direction, possibly allowing them to move forward towards the next blue box. 

So, the chosen action should be to turn left.

Let's see. The goal is to pick up a blue box and then go to another blue box. So first, I need to find a blue box, pick it up, and then navigate to the destination blue box.

Looking at the current observation: there are two blue boxes. One is 3 steps left and 1 step forward, and the other is 1 step left and 4 steps forward. Also, there are walls in the way. The agent needs to navigate around these walls to reach the blue boxes.

First, I need to figure out the agent's current orientation. Previous actions like turning left, right, etc., might indicate the direction they're facing. Let's try to track the direction based on the actions taken so far.

From the history, the agent has been turning left, right, etc., to adjust direction. Let's assume the agent was initially facing north. Let's walk through the previous steps:

1. After initial observations with walls forward and right, the agent turned left (maybe facing east now).
2. Then another observation with blue boxes left and forward. Turned left again (now facing south).
3. Another turn left (now west).
4. Then turned right (now north again).
5. Then another turn left (east), and so on. But this might not be accurate without exact tracking.

Alternatively, maybe the agent is facing a direction where moving forward hits a wall, so they need to turn to navigate around.

In the current observation, walls are 5 steps forward and 2 steps right. Blue boxes are in different positions. The agent needs to pick up one blue box first. Let's see the positions:

- Blue box A: 3 steps left and 1 step forward.
- Blue box B: 1 step left and 4 steps forward.

To get to either blue box, the agent needs to move in a direction that isn't blocked by walls. For example, if facing north, moving forward is blocked by a wall 5 steps away. To reach blue box A (3 left, 1 forward), the agent might need to turn left (west) and go forward to pick it up. But first, they might need to adjust their direction.

Alternatively, the agent could be facing east. If the wall is to the right (2 steps right), then turning left would face north, but the wall is 5 steps forward. Hmm.

Wait, the current walls are 5 steps forward and 2 steps right. Suppose the agent is facing north. Then forward is blocked by a wall 5 steps away. Right is 2 steps to a wall. So to get to blue box A (3 left, 1 forward), if facing north, turning left (west) would allow moving left towards the blue box. But need to check where the walls are in other directions.

Alternatively, if facing east, forward is blocked by a wall 5 steps, right is blocked by a wall 2 steps. Then blue box A is 3 left (west) and 1 forward (north). So to get there, turn north (which would be left turn from east?), but need to see.

This is getting confusing without knowing the exact direction. Maybe I should focus on the relative positions. The agent needs to pick up a blue box first. Let's say the agent is holding nothing. So the first priority is to pick up a blue box.

Looking at the two blue boxes:

- Box A: 3 left, 1 forward. If the agent is facing a direction where ""left"" is the correct path, they can move left and forward.
- Box B: 1 left, 4 forward. That's further away.

But the agent needs to pick up a blue box first. Let's consider Box A. To reach it, the agent might need to turn left or right to face the correct direction. Suppose the agent needs to turn left to face west, then move forward to reach the left direction. But the wall is 2 steps to the right, which might be east. So if facing north, right is east with a wall 2 steps. Turning left (west) would have the blue box 3 steps left (which would be west) and 1 step forward (north). So moving left (west) 3 steps and forward 1 step. But how to do that when there's a wall 5 steps forward (north). Wait, if facing north, moving forward is blocked by a wall 5 steps away. So to reach Box A (3 left, 1 forward), which is west 3 and north 1, the agent can't go north because the wall is there. So maybe the agent needs to go west first, then north.

But how to get west if facing north? Turning left (west) and move forward. But how many steps? The observation says the wall is 5 steps forward when facing north. So if the agent turns left (west), can they move forward towards the blue box?

Wait, the blue box A is 3 steps left and 1 step forward. If the agent is facing north, left is west. So 3 steps west and 1 step north. But the wall is 5 steps north (forward), so moving north isn't possible. Therefore, the agent must go west first, then adjust direction.

So, first turn left (west), then go forward to reach the blue box. But when facing west, what's in front? The observation doesn't mention walls in that direction. The only walls mentioned are 5 steps forward (north when facing north) and 2 steps right (east when facing north). When facing west, forward would be south. The observation doesn't mention a wall there, so maybe it's clear. So the agent can turn left (west), then go forward 3 steps to reach the blue box A. Then pick it up.

Alternatively, if the agent is facing east, right is north (since right from east is north). But the wall is 2 steps right (north), and 5 steps forward (east). Then blue box A is 3 left (west) and 1 forward (north). So to get there, the agent would need to turn left (north), but there's a wall 2 steps north. So that's not possible. Hence, facing east might not be the right direction.

Alternatively, maybe the agent is facing south. Then forward is south with a wall 5 steps. Right would be east with a wall 2 steps. Blue box A is 3 left (west) and 1 forward (south). So to reach it, turn left (west), go forward 3 steps, then maybe turn north? But the wall is 5 steps forward when facing south, which is still south. So that's a problem.

This is getting complicated. Maybe the best approach is to navigate towards the closest blue box that's reachable. Box A is 3 left and 1 forward. Box B is 1 left and 4 forward. The agent needs to avoid walls. Let's assume the agent is facing north. To reach Box A:

- Turn left (west), then go forward. Then, since the wall is 5 steps forward when facing north, but when facing west, forward is south. There's no mention of a wall in the south direction, so it's possible. Then move 3 steps west (left) and 1 step north (forward from west facing). Wait, no. If facing west, moving forward would be south. So moving west (left) is a turn, then moving forward (south) to reach the blue box.

Wait, the blue box A is 3 steps left and 1 step forward from the agent's current position. If the agent is facing north, left is west. So 3 steps west and 1 step north. But moving north is blocked by a wall. So the agent can't go north. Therefore, the only way is to go west first, then perhaps turn north. But how?

Alternatively, after turning left (west), the agent can move forward (south) to a position where they can then turn north and go forward. But since the wall is 5 steps north when facing north, but in the south direction (when facing west), moving forward (south) might be possible.

This is getting too confusing without knowing the exact layout. Maybe the best action is to turn left to face west, then go forward towards the blue box. Since the observation doesn't mention walls in the west direction, it's possible.

So the steps would be:

1. Turn left (to face west).
2. Go forward 3 steps to reach the blue box A's left position.
3. Then turn north (right turn from west) and go forward 1 step to reach the blue box.
4. Pick up the blue box.

But the agent needs to pick up the box first. So after reaching the spot, use pick up action.

But the current observation is after turning right previously, leading to this state. The agent hasn't picked up any box yet. So the priority is to navigate to a blue box and pick it up.

Given the current observation, the agent needs to decide the next action. Let's look at the available actions: turn left, turn right, go forward, pick up, drop, toggle.

But the agent isn't holding anything yet, so pick up is only useful when there's a blue box directly below. The current observation lists two blue boxes, but their positions are relative. The agent needs to face the correct direction to have the blue box below them.

In the current observation, the blue boxes are at positions relative to the agent. For example, one is 3 steps left and 1 forward, the other is 1 left and 4 forward. To interact with either, the agent must face the direction where the blue box is directly below.

Assuming the agent is facing north, the blue box A is 3 steps west (left) and 1 step north (forward). But moving north is blocked. So maybe the agent needs to turn left (west) to face that direction. Then, moving forward would take them towards the blue box's left position. Wait, no. If facing west, moving forward would go south. The blue box is 3 steps left (west) and 1 step forward (north) from the agent's original position. This is getting too confusing.

Alternative approach: The agent needs to pick up a blue box. So the next action should be to face a direction where a blue box is directly below and then use pick up. But how to determine that.

Looking at the current observation, the two blue boxes are:

- 3 steps left, 1 step forward
- 1 step left, 4 steps forward

Suppose the agent is facing north. Then:

- Left is west. So 3 steps west and 1 step north would be the first blue box. But moving north is blocked by a wall. So the agent can't go there. Therefore, maybe the agent needs to turn left (west) and then move forward to get to the left position, then turn north and move forward 1 step. But that might require multiple actions.

Alternatively, the agent could turn right (east), but the wall is 2 steps right (north from east), so that's not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe the agent is facing south. Then forward is south with a wall 5 steps. Right is east with a wall 2 steps. The blue box A is 3 steps left (west) and 1 step forward (south). So to reach it, turn left (west), go forward 3 steps, then perhaps turn north (right from west) and go forward 1 step. But again, the wall is 5 steps forward when facing south, which is south direction.

This is really tricky. Maybe the best action here is to turn left to face a direction that allows moving towards one of the blue boxes without hitting walls. For example, turning left (west) and then moving forward might be possible since the walls mentioned are in other directions.

In the current observation, the walls are 5 steps forward (which would be south if facing north) and 2 steps right (east if facing north). So if the agent turns left (west), their forward direction is south, which doesn't have a wall mentioned. They can then move forward towards the blue box A, which is 3 steps left (west) and 1 step forward (north from original position, but facing west, moving forward is south). Wait, this is confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the agent is facing east. Then forward is east (blocked by wall 5 steps), right is north (blocked by wall 2 steps). The blue box A is 3 steps left (west) and 1 step forward (east). But moving east is blocked. So the agent would need to turn left (north) to face north, but there's a wall 5 steps forward. Not helpful.

This is getting me stuck. Let's think differently. The agent needs to pick up a blue box first. To do that, it must be directly below the agent. So the agent needs to face a direction where a blue box is in front (1 step ahead). Let's check the current blue box positions:

- Blue box A: 3 steps left, 1 step forward. So if the agent is facing north, left is west. So to have the blue box directly below, the agent would need to be 3 steps west and 1 step north of the blue box's position. Wait, no. The positions are relative to the agent. So if the agent is facing north, and there's a blue box 3 steps left (west) and 1 step forward (north), that means the blue box is 3 steps to the west and 1 step north of the agent's current position. But the agent can't move north because there's a wall. So the agent can't reach it directly.

The other blue box is 1 step left (west) and 4 steps forward (north). Again, facing north, moving north is blocked. So the agent can't reach either directly. Therefore, the agent needs to reposition itself.

Perhaps the best action is to turn left or right to face a direction where there's a path to the blue boxes without hitting walls. For example, turning left (west) and moving forward. Since the wall is 5 steps forward when facing north, but when facing west, forward is south, which isn't mentioned as having a wall. So moving forward when facing west could be possible.

So the next action could be to turn left, then go forward. That would position the agent facing west, then moving forward into open space towards the blue box A's left direction. Then, once there, adjust direction to face north and move forward to the blue box.

But the agent needs to pick up the blue box. So after moving into position, the agent would need to turn right (north) and move forward 1 step, then pick up.

But given the current observation, the agent's immediate next action should be to either turn left or right to face a direction that allows approaching a blue box.

In the current observation, the walls are 5 steps forward and 2 steps right. Assuming the agent is facing north, turning left (west) would allow moving forward without hitting a wall (since the wall is 5 steps forward when facing north, not west). So turn left, then go forward.

So the chosen action would be turn left, then go forward. But the agent needs to output one action at a time. So the next action is to turn left to face west, which allows moving towards the blue box.

11,Failed to obtain a valid action from the reasoning.,"<reasoning>
The goal is to go to a blue box after picking up a blue box. Right now, there's a blue box that I haven't picked up yet. Let me check the current observation again.

The observation says there's a wall 5 steps forward, a wall 2 steps left, and a blue box 1 step right and 3 steps forward. So I need to get to that blue box, pick it up, and then go to another blue box. But first, I need to pick up this one.

Wait, the agent's objective is to go to a blue box after picking up a blue box. So maybe the first blue box is the one to pick up, and then go to the next one? Or is the initial instruction to first pick up a blue box and then go to a different blue box? The problem statement says ""go to a blue box after you pick up a blue box."" So the sequence is pick up first, then go to another blue box.

But in the current observation, the blue box is 1 step right and 3 steps forward. So my current position must be such that to the right and forward there's the blue box. So I need to navigate to that box.

Wait, but how am I facing? Because directions matter. The agent's orientation isn't given in the observation. The observations mention distances in directions relative to the agent's current facing. For example, ""1 step right"" would mean to the agent's right direction, which depends on their facing direction.

But since the agent's previous actions were turning left and right, maybe I can track the orientation. Let me think about the history.

Looking back at the previous interactions:

The user's observations and the agent's actions:

1. First observation: wall 1 forward, wall 2 right. Agent turned left.

2. Then observation: wall 5 forward, wall 1 right, blue box 2 left and 4 forward. Agent turned left.

3. Next observation: wall 6 forward, wall 2 left, blue box 1 right and 4 forward. Agent turned left.

4. Then observation: wall 2 forward, wall 1 left. Agent turned right.

5. Observation: wall 6 forward, wall 2 left, blue box 1 right and 4 forward. Default action was go forward.

6. Then blue box 3 left and 1 forward, 1 left and 4 forward. Agent turned right.

7. Observation: blue box 1 right and 3 forward. Agent turned right.

8. Observation: walls again, turned left.

9. Another observation with two blue boxes, turned right.

10. Now current observation: walls 5 forward, 2 left, blue box 1 right and 3 forward.

So based on the previous actions, maybe the agent is facing north, for example. Each turn left or right changes the direction.

But maybe it's easier to think about the relative positions. The blue box is 1 step right and 3 steps forward. So if I'm facing north, right would be east. So the blue box is to the east and 3 steps north. But the wall is 5 steps forward (north), so if I'm facing north, moving forward would hit the wall. But the blue box is 3 steps forward (north) and 1 step east (right). So my current position is such that moving forward 3 steps would reach the blue box, but there's a wall 5 steps forward, meaning that beyond 5 steps forward is a wall. Wait, but the blue box is 3 steps forward. So maybe the wall is further ahead. So perhaps the agent is facing north, with a wall at 5 steps north, but the blue box is at 3 steps north and 1 east (right). So to get to the blue box, the agent needs to turn east (right) and then move forward 3 steps? Or maybe adjust direction.

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to first turn right to face east, then move forward to reach the blue box. But wait, the current observation says the blue box is 1 step right and 3 steps forward. So if the agent is facing north, right would be east. So the blue box is 1 step east (right) and 3 steps north (forward). But there's a wall 5 steps forward (north), so the path north is blocked beyond 5 steps. But the blue box is only 3 steps north, so that's possible. So the agent needs to go north 3 steps and east 1 step. But how to navigate that.

Wait, but how is the agent oriented? Let's assume the agent starts facing north. Each turn left would make them face west, then south, then east, then north again. Each turn right would make them face east, south, west, north.

But given the previous actions, let's try to reconstruct the orientation.

First observation: walls forward (north) 1, right (east) 2. Agent turned left. So if facing north, turning left makes them face west. Next observation: walls forward (west) 5, right (south) 1, blue box 2 left (east) and 4 forward (south). So after turning left from north to west, moving forward would go west, but the wall is 5 steps west. The blue box is 2 steps east (left from west) and 4 steps forward (south). Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe it's better to track direction step by step.

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to face the direction where the blue box is located. Since the blue box is 1 step right and 3 steps forward, the agent needs to adjust their orientation so that moving forward will take them towards the blue box. For example, if the agent is facing east, then moving forward would go east, but the blue box is 1 right (south) and 3 forward (north). Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, if the agent is facing north, and the blue box is 1 right (east) and 3 forward (north), then to get to the blue box, the agent needs to first move east 1 step, then north 3 steps. But there's a wall 5 steps north, but the blue box is only 3 steps north, so that's okay. But how to reach east 1 step when there's a wall 2 steps right (east) in an earlier observation?

Wait, in the first observation, there was a wall 2 steps right. If the agent was facing north, then right is east, and the wall is 2 steps east. So to move east 1 step, but the wall is 2 steps east. Wait, but the blue box is 1 step right and 3 forward. So maybe after turning left multiple times, the agent's orientation changed so that right is now a different direction.

This is getting a bit confusing without knowing the agent's exact orientation. Maybe I should focus on the current observation and possible actions.

Current Observation:

- Wall 5 steps forward.

- Wall 2 steps left.

- Blue box 1 step right and 3 steps forward.

So the agent is facing a direction where forward is blocked by a wall 5 steps away. Left is blocked by a wall 2 steps. Right is not a wall; there's a blue box 1 step right and 3 steps forward. But moving forward 3 steps would reach the blue box, but the wall is 5 steps forward. Wait, that can't be. If the blue box is 3 steps forward, then beyond that would be 2 more steps to the wall. So the path forward has the blue box at 3 steps, then a wall at 5 steps. That makes sense.

So the agent needs to reach the blue box which is 3 steps forward and 1 step right. But how? Because moving forward would eventually hit the wall, but the blue box is before that. However, the agent needs to navigate to that position.

But the problem is the agent's current orientation. If the agent is facing a direction where forward is blocked by a wall 5 steps away, and left is blocked by a wall 2 steps, then the agent must be facing a direction where the blue box is to the right and forward.

For example, suppose the agent is facing south. Then:

- Forward would be south, with a wall 5 steps south.

- Left would be west, with a wall 2 steps west.

- The blue box is 1 step right (east) and 3 steps forward (south). So the blue box is 3 steps south and 1 step east from the agent's current position.

In this case, to reach the blue box, the agent would need to turn right (to face east), move forward 1 step to the east, then turn south (right again?), then move forward 3 steps. But this depends on the agent's current orientation.

Alternatively, if the agent is facing east:

- Forward is east, wall 5 steps.

- Left is north, wall 2 steps.

- Blue box is 1 step right (south) and 3 steps forward (east). So the blue box is 3 steps east and 1 step south. So the agent needs to move forward 3 steps east to reach the blue box, but that's blocked by a wall at 5 steps. Wait, but the blue box is at 3 steps forward, so maybe the wall is beyond that. Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, maybe the agent is facing north, with the wall 5 steps north, wall 2 steps east, and the blue box 1 step east and 3 steps north. But if the agent is facing north, then right is east. So to reach the blue box, they need to move east 1 step and north 3 steps. But how?

If the agent is facing north, they can't move east directly because the wall is 2 steps east. Wait, but in the current observation, the wall is 2 steps left. Left from north is west. So the wall is 2 steps west. Right is east, which has the blue box 1 step right and 3 forward. So if the agent is facing north, right is east. The blue box is 1 step east and 3 steps north. But moving east 1 step would take them to east 1, then they can turn north? Or move forward 3 steps north to reach the blue box.

Wait, if the agent is facing north, and the blue box is 3 steps forward (north) and 1 step right (east), then the agent can first move right (east) 1 step, then move forward 3 steps north. But there's a wall 2 steps east. Wait, but in the current observation, the wall is 2 steps left (west). So east would be clear except for the blue box at 1 step east. So moving east 1 step is possible, then moving north 3 steps (forward) would reach the blue box.

But how to do that. The agent's current action options are turn left, right, go forward, pick up, drop, toggle.

In the current observation, the blue box is 1 step right and 3 forward. So if the agent is facing north, they need to turn right (east) to face east, then move forward 1 step to the east, then turn north (another right turn?), but wait, if facing east, turning right would make them face south. Hmm, this might not be the right approach.

Alternatively, after turning right (to face east), move forward 1 step to reach the blue box's east position, then turn north (left turn from east) and move forward 3 steps. But each turn changes direction.

Alternatively, maybe the agent can move forward 3 steps north first, but then need to go east 1 step. But moving forward north 3 steps would reach the blue box. But how to do that if facing north.

Wait, if the agent is facing north, and the blue box is 3 steps forward, then moving forward 3 steps would reach the blue box. But the problem is that the blue box is also 1 step right. So perhaps the agent is not aligned correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the agent needs to first move right (east) 1 step to be aligned with the blue box's east position, then move forward 3 steps north.

So actions would be: turn right (to face east), go forward 1 step, then turn left (to face north), go forward 3 steps. Then pick up the blue box.

But the current observation shows that the blue box is 1 step right and 3 steps forward. So if the agent is facing a direction where right is east and forward is north, then moving right 1 and forward 3 would get to the blue box.

But how to get oriented that way.

Alternatively, if the agent is facing west:

- Forward is west, wall 5 steps.

- Left is south, wall 2 steps.

- Blue box is 1 step right (east) and 3 steps forward (west). So the blue box is 3 steps west and 1 step east. That doesn't make sense because if facing west, forward is west, so the blue box being 3 steps forward (west) and 1 step right (east) would be 3 west and 1 east, which is 2 net west. But the observation says 1 step right and 3 forward, which would be 3 west and 1 east, but that's a position 2 steps west. Not sure.

This is getting too complicated without knowing the exact orientation. Maybe I should look for the simplest path.

The blue box is 1 step right and 3 steps forward. The agent needs to get to that position. The possible actions are turn left, right, go forward, etc. But the agent can't move forward 3 steps because there's a wall 5 steps forward. Wait, the wall is 5 steps forward, but the blue box is 3 steps forward. So moving forward 3 steps would reach the blue box, then beyond that is the wall. So the agent can move forward 3 steps to reach the blue box.

But how to align their direction so that moving forward 3 steps gets them to the blue box, which is also 1 step to the right.

Ah, so the agent's current direction must be such that moving forward 3 steps gets them to the blue box's forward position, and moving right 1 step gets them to the blue box's right position. So the agent needs to face a direction where forward is the direction towards the blue box's position minus the right step.

Alternatively, the agent is facing a direction where moving forward 3 steps and right 1 step gets them to the blue box. So the direction is such that moving forward 3 and right 1 aligns with the blue box's location.

This is getting too abstract. Let's think step by step.

Current Observation:

- Wall 5 forward.

- Wall 2 left.

- Blue box 1 right and 3 forward.

Possible actions: turn left, turn right, go forward, pick up, drop, toggle.

But the agent can't pick up the blue box yet because they are not beside it. They need to navigate to it.

The agent's current position is such that moving forward 5 steps hits a wall, moving left 2 steps hits a wall, but moving right 1 step and forward 3 steps reaches the blue box.

So the agent needs to adjust their orientation so that moving forward 3 steps will take them to the blue box. Let's assume the agent is facing a direction where moving forward 3 steps aligns with the blue box's forward direction and moving right 1 step aligns with the blue box's right direction.

For example, if the agent is facing north, then moving right would be east. The blue box is 1 east and 3 north. So the agent needs to move east 1 and north 3. But how to do that.

If the agent is facing north, they can't move east directly because the wall is 2 steps east (from the first observation). Wait, but in the current observation, the wall is 2 steps left (west). So east is clear except for the blue box at 1 step east.

So if the agent is facing north:

- Turn right (east), move forward 1 step to reach east 1.

- Then turn left (north), move forward 3 steps to reach north 3, which is the blue box.

But the agent needs to toggle the blue box to pick it up. So after reaching the blue box, they can toggle it to pick up.

But the problem is the agent's current observation shows the blue box is 1 step right and 3 forward. So if the agent is facing north, turning right (east) and moving forward 1 step would get them to the blue box's east position, then turning left (north) and moving forward 3 steps would reach the blue box.

But how to execute this.

The current possible actions are turn left, right, go forward, etc.

In the current state, the agent is facing a direction where forward is blocked by a wall 5 steps away, left by a wall 2 steps. The blue box is 1 right and 3 forward.

So the agent needs to turn in a direction that allows them to move towards the blue box.

If the agent turns right (east), then their forward direction becomes east. But the blue box is 1 step right (which would be south from east?) and 3 forward (east). Wait, no. If the agent is facing east, then right would be south, and forward is east. The blue box is 1 step right (south) and 3 forward (east). So to reach the blue box, the agent would need to move east 3 steps (forward) and south 1 step (right from east perspective). But how.

Alternatively, if the agent turns right (east), then moves forward 3 steps east, they would be at east 3, but the blue box is at east 1 and north 3. So that's not aligning.

This is getting too confusing. Maybe I should look for the immediate next step.

The agent's goal is to pick up a blue box first. So they need to reach the blue box at 1 right and 3 forward. The possible actions are turn left, right, go forward, etc.

If the agent turns right, their new forward direction is east. Then moving forward would go east, but the blue box is east 1 and north 3. So turning right and moving forward won't get them to the blue box.

Alternatively, turning left. If the agent turns left (west), their forward direction is west, but there's a wall 2 steps west. So moving forward would hit the wall.

Alternatively, go forward. But the wall is 5 steps forward, so moving forward would hit the wall. But the blue box is 3 steps forward. So can the agent move forward 3 steps? The action 'go forward' only moves one step at a time. So they need to move forward three times.

But the problem is that after moving forward once, the observation would change. So the agent needs to plan multiple steps ahead.

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to first adjust their direction to face north-east or something, but the possible actions are only turning left or right, which changes direction by 90 degrees each time.

Your previous output did not contain a valid action. Defaulted to action: go forward

12,Failed to obtain a valid action from the reasoning.,"<reasoning>
Let's see. The goal is to go to a blue box after picking up a blue box. So first, I need to pick up a blue box, then move to another blue box. But maybe the second blue box is the one I need to go to after picking up the first? The problem says ""go to a blue box after you pick up a blue box."" So initially, I need to pick up a blue box, then go to another blue box.

Looking at the current observation: there's a wall 4 steps forward, a wall 2 steps left, and a blue box 1 step right and 2 steps forward. So the agent is facing a direction where in front (forward) there's a wall 4 steps away. To the left, a wall 2 steps. The blue box is to the right (1 step right) and 2 steps forward. So the agent's current position is such that to their right is a path, and ahead is blocked by a wall. The blue box is diagonally to the right and a bit forward.

The agent hasn't picked up any box yet, so first priority is to pick up a blue box. The blue box is at 1 step right and 2 forward. So how to reach it? The agent needs to turn right to face the direction where the box is, then move forward two steps, then pick it up. But let's check the previous steps to see the agent's orientation.

Looking back at the history, the agent was turning left multiple times, then right, etc. Let's assume the agent's current direction. Suppose the agent was facing north. If they turned right, they'd face east. Then, if the blue box is 1 step right and 2 forward, that would be east and north. Wait, maybe I need to visualize the map.

Alternatively, maybe the agent is facing a direction where turning right would align them towards the blue box. Let's think step by step.

Current observation: Wall forward 4, wall left 2, blue box right 1, forward 2. So if the agent turns right, their forward direction would be east (assuming they were facing north initially). Then moving forward 2 steps would take them to the blue box's position (since the box is 1 step right and 2 forward from current position). Wait, if they turn right, their forward is east, right is south. Wait, maybe the directions are relative. Let's clarify:

Assuming the agent is facing north. Directions: forward is north, right is east, left is west. Then, a blue box that's 1 step right and 2 forward would be east 1, north 2. So to get there, the agent needs to turn right (east), then move forward two steps. But there's a wall 4 steps forward (north), so moving north directly isn't possible. However, after turning right (east), moving two steps forward (east) would reach the blue box's position. Wait, but the blue box is also 1 step right (east) and 2 forward (north). So if the agent turns right (east), then moves forward two steps (east), then turns north? No, that might not align. Maybe I'm getting confused with the coordinate system.

Alternatively, the agent's current position has the blue box 1 step to the right (east) and 2 steps forward (north). So if the agent is facing north, then turning right (east) and moving forward two steps would take them east two steps, but the box is east 1 and north 2. Wait, that doesn't add up. Maybe the agent needs to adjust their direction to face northeast? But the allowed actions are turn left, right, go forward, etc. So maybe the agent needs to turn right, move forward two steps, then turn north, but there's a wall north. This is getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps the agent needs to first turn right to face east, then move forward two steps to reach the blue box's position. But when moving forward two steps east, would that position have the blue box? Let me think. The current position has the blue box 1 east and 2 north. If the agent turns right (east) and moves forward two steps (east), they would be two steps east, but the blue box is only one east. Then, they would need to move north, but there's a wall four steps north. Hmm, that's a problem. So maybe the agent's current orientation is different.

Alternatively, if the agent is facing east. Then, the blue box is 1 step right (south) and 2 steps forward (east). So to reach the blue box, the agent would need to move forward two steps (east) and then turn right (south), but that's not possible because moving forward two steps would already take them past the blue box's east position. This is confusing without knowing the agent's current direction.

Looking back at the history, the previous actions were turning left, right, etc. For example, in the first few observations, the agent turned left multiple times, then turned right. Maybe the agent's direction has changed over time. Let's try to track the direction.

Assume the agent starts facing north.

First observation: walls forward 1, right 2. Agent turns left (now facing west).

Next observation: walls forward 5, right 1, blue box 2 left and 4 forward. Agent turns left (now facing south).

Next observation: walls forward 6, left 2, blue box 1 right and 4 forward. Agent turns left (now facing east).

Next observation: walls forward 2, left 1. Agent turns right (now facing north).

Next: same as third observation. Default to go forward.

And so on. It's a bit unclear, but maybe the agent's current direction is north again.

In the latest observation, the agent is facing north again. Walls forward 4, left 2 (so left is west, which is 2 steps away). Blue box is 1 step right (east) and 2 forward (north). So to reach the blue box, the agent needs to go east 1 and north 2. But there's a wall four steps north, so moving north directly isn't possible. Therefore, the agent must first go east, then north? But there's a wall north four steps away, so maybe the blue box is in a position that requires moving east then north, but the wall is blocking the direct path.

Alternatively, perhaps the agent needs to turn right (east), move forward one step to the blue box's east position, then turn north and move two steps. But there's a wall four steps north, so moving north two steps would hit the wall. That can't be. So maybe the blue box is actually reachable by moving east and then north, but the wall is further north. So perhaps the blue box is placed in a way that requires the agent to adjust their path.

Wait, the current observation says the blue box is 1 step right and 3 steps forward from the previous default action. But in the latest observation, it's 1 step right and 2 steps forward. Let me focus on the latest observation:

Observation:
a wall 4 steps forward
a wall 2 steps left
a blue box 1 step right and 2 steps forward

So the agent is facing north (assuming previous direction changes). To get to the blue box at (east 1, north 2), but north is blocked by a wall 4 steps away. So the agent can't go straight north. Therefore, the agent must go east first, then north. But moving east 1 step would put them at the blue box's east position, then moving north 2 steps would hit the wall. So that's not possible. Therefore, maybe the blue box is actually in a different position.

Alternatively, maybe the agent's orientation is east. Let's try that. If facing east, then right is south, left is north. The blue box is 1 step right (south) and 2 steps forward (east). So moving forward two steps (east) would take the agent two steps east, then turning right (south) and moving one step. But there's a wall four steps north (which would be the left direction). This is getting too confusing without a clear map.

Alternatively, perhaps the agent needs to turn right (east), move forward two steps, then pick up the blue box. Wait, but the blue box is 1 step right and 2 steps forward from the current position. If the agent turns right (east), their forward direction is east. Moving forward two steps would take them two steps east. Then, the blue box is one step to the right (which would be south of that position?), but that doesn't align. I'm probably mixing up the directions.

Another approach: The agent's current position has a blue box at (1 right, 2 forward). The agent needs to navigate to that box and pick it up. The walls are in the way. So possible steps:

1. Turn right to face the direction where the blue box is relatively.
2. Move forward until reaching the blue box.
3. Pick it up.
4. Then navigate to another blue box.

But given the current observation, the agent is facing north, with a wall north 4 steps, wall west 2 steps, and blue box east 1, north 2. To reach the blue box, the agent would need to go east 1 and north 2, but the north direction is blocked. So perhaps the agent needs to go east first, then north. But moving east 1 step would reach the blue box's east position, then moving north 2 steps would hit the wall. So that's not possible. Therefore, maybe the agent is not facing north.

Wait, maybe the agent is facing east. Then, the blue box is 1 step right (south) and 2 steps forward (east). So moving forward two steps (east) would get to the blue box's position, and then turning right (south) isn't needed. Wait, but the blue box is 1 step right and 2 forward. If facing east, right is south, so 1 step right would be south 1, and forward 2 steps east. So the blue box is at (east 2, south 1) from the agent's current position. But that doesn't make sense with the observation. The observation says the blue box is 1 step right and 2 steps forward. So if facing east, right is south, forward is east. So 1 right (south) and 2 forward (east) would place the box at east 2, south 1. But the agent's current position has a wall north 4 steps. So the agent is in a spot where north is blocked, east is clear, south has a wall 2 steps left (which would be west 2 steps). This is getting too complicated.

Perhaps the best approach is to turn right, move forward until the blue box is in front, then pick it up. Let's try:

Current observation: blue box is 1 step right and 2 steps forward. If the agent turns right, their forward direction is east. Then, moving forward two steps would take them two steps east. Now, the blue box is 1 step right (south) and 2 steps forward (east) from the original position. Wait, after turning right and moving two steps east, the agent's new position is two east. The blue box was originally at 1 east and 2 north. So from the new position, the blue box is 1 east - 2 east = -1 east (west 1) and 2 north. But that's not possible. I think I'm mixing up the coordinates.

Alternatively, perhaps the agent needs to first move forward past the wall, but there's a wall four steps forward. So moving forward isn't an option. They need to go around the wall. The wall to the left is two steps away. If the agent turns left (west), there's a wall two steps left, which would be north two steps? No, directions are relative.

This is getting too confusing. Let's try to simplify. The agent's goal is to pick up a blue box and then go to another blue box. Currently, there's a blue box 1 right and 2 forward. The agent hasn't picked up any box yet. So the priority is to pick that box up.

To reach the blue box, the agent needs to navigate to its position. Since there's a wall four steps forward, the agent can't go straight north. So the agent must turn right (east) and move forward until they can turn north towards the blue box. But after turning right and moving, the agent's position would allow them to approach the blue box.

Alternatively, the agent could turn left (west), but there's a wall two steps left (west), which is a wall two steps in the direction the agent is turning. So turning left and moving forward would hit the wall.

Therefore, the safest bet is to turn right (east), move forward until there's no wall in front, then navigate to the blue box. But in the current observation, moving forward four steps is a wall. So after turning right, can the agent move forward? Let's see:

If the agent turns right (east), their forward direction is east. The observation doesn't mention a wall in front after turning right, except the initial wall four steps forward (north), which is now the left direction. Wait, no. If the agent turns right (east), their forward direction is east, so the walls mentioned in the observation are relative to their current direction. Wait, the observation states ""a wall 4 steps forward"" which would be in the direction the agent is currently facing. If the agent turns right, their new forward direction is east, so the walls mentioned (wall 4 forward, wall 2 left) would now be different.

Wait, the observation is given from the agent's current perspective. So ""a wall 4 steps forward"" means in the direction the agent is currently facing. ""a wall 2 steps left"" means to the agent's current left. So if the agent turns right, their new forward direction is east, and left is north.

In the current observation, after turning right, the agent's forward direction is east. The previous walls are now in different directions. But the latest observation after turning right would need to be considered. However, the user provided the current observation as:

Observation:
a wall 4 steps forward
a wall 2 steps left
a blue box 1 step right and 2 steps forward

Assuming the agent is facing north, with forward being north, left being west. The blue box is east 1, north 2. There's a wall north 4, west 2.

So to reach the blue box at (east 1, north 2), the agent needs to go east 1 and north 2. But the north direction is blocked by a wall. Therefore, the agent must go around the wall. The only way is to go east first, then north.

So steps:

1. Turn right (east) to face east.
2. Move forward until there's no wall. But in the current observation, moving forward four steps is a wall (north), but after turning right, the forward direction is east. The observation doesn't mention a wall in front after turning right, except that the original wall is north. So maybe after turning right, moving forward is possible.

Wait, when the agent turns right, their new forward direction is east. The previous wall four steps forward (north) is now the agent's left direction (west). So turning right, the agent's forward path (east) is clear, except for the blue box which is east 1 and north 2. Wait, no. The blue box is in the original position, which is east 1 and north 2 from the agent's current position. After turning right (facing east), moving forward one step would take the agent east 1, which is the position of the blue box's east coordinate. Then, moving north from there would require turning north, but there's a wall four steps north in the original direction. So from the new position (east 1), moving north 2 steps would hit the wall.

This isn't working. Maybe the agent needs to go east, then north around the wall. But the wall is four steps north in the original direction, which is west of the agent's new position. So from the new position (east 1), moving north would be west of the original wall. Wait, this is too confusing without a visual map.

Alternative approach: Since the agent's goal is to pick up a blue box and then go to another, maybe the current blue box is the one to pick up first. So the agent needs to navigate to it. The blue box is 1 step right and 2 forward. If the agent can turn right and move forward, then pick it up.

But how? Let's think step by step.

Current direction: Assume north.

Blue box is east 1, north 2.

Walls: north 4, west 2.

To get to the blue box, the agent needs to move east 1 and north 2. But moving north directly is blocked. So the agent must go east first, then north.

1. Turn right (east).
2. Move forward 1 step (now at east 1).
3. Turn north (which would be the agent's left, since they're facing east).
4. Move forward 2 steps. But there's a wall four steps north (original direction), so moving north from the new position (east 1) two steps would hit the wall.

This doesn't work. Therefore, there must be another path.

Alternative plan: Turn right (east), move forward until there's no wall. But in the current observation, moving forward four steps is a wall (north), but after turning right, the forward direction is east. The observation says there's a wall four steps forward (original north), which is now the agent's left. So moving east, the agent can move forward without hitting a wall. Wait, the observation states ""a wall 4 steps forward"" which is in the original direction (north). After turning right, the forward direction is east, so the wall four steps forward (east) isn't mentioned. Does that mean there's no wall east? The observation doesn't mention a wall in the new forward direction, only in the original direction. So perhaps the agent can move east freely.

So:

1. Turn right (east).
2. Move forward 1 step (now at east 1, which is the blue box's position).
3. Pick up the blue box.

But the blue box is 1 step right and 2 forward from the original position. After turning right and moving 1 step forward, the agent is at east 1. The blue box is north 2 from the original position, which would be west 2 from the agent's new position. That doesn't align. So the blue box must be in a different position.

I think I'm making a mistake here. Let's re-express the coordinates.

Assume the agent is at position (0,0), facing north.

Walls:
- North: 4 steps away → at (0,4)
- West: 2 steps away → at (-2,0)

Blue box: 1 step right (east) and 2 steps forward (","

Your previous output did not contain a valid action. Defaulted to action: go forward

Observation:
a wall 3 steps forward
a wall 2 steps left
a blue box 1 step right and 1 step forward",0,False
13,turn right,"<reasoning>
The goal is to pick up a blue box first and then go to another blue box. The current observation shows a wall 3 steps forward, a wall 2 steps left, and a blue box that's 1 step right and 1 step forward.

So, the agent needs to get to the blue box. Let me visualize this. The agent is facing a direction where there's a wall 3 steps forward, so maybe north. The wall 2 steps left could be west. The blue box is 1 step right (east) and 1 step forward (north). So relative to the agent's position, the blue box is northeast.

The agent needs to move towards the blue box. If the agent is facing north, to get to the box, they need to go east first. But the problem is, in the current observation, moving forward would hit the wall (3 steps away). So moving forward isn't an option right now. The blue box is east and north, so the agent needs to turn right to face east, then go forward until they reach the box. But wait, in the previous steps, maybe the agent turned left or right before. Let me check the history.

Looking back at the user's messages, there's a pattern of turning left and right, but sometimes defaulting to go forward when no valid action was chosen. The latest observation before this one had the blue box at 1 step right and 1 step forward. Now, after moving forward (default action), the observation is updated. The blue box is now 1 step right and 1 step forward again? Or maybe the agent moved closer.

Wait, the previous observation after the default go forward action showed the blue box at 1 step right and 2 steps forward. Now it's 1 step right and 1 step forward. That suggests the agent moved forward once, reducing the forward distance to 1 step. So now the blue box is directly to the northeast, 1 step each.

But the agent's current position would have the wall 3 steps forward (originally) and after moving forward once, that wall is now 2 steps forward. But according to the latest observation, the wall is 3 steps forward again. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.

The latest observation given is:

Observation:
a wall 3 steps forward
a wall 2 steps left
a blue box 1 step right and 1 step forward

So the agent is facing a direction where moving forward 3 steps hits a wall. The wall to the left is 2 steps away. The blue box is 1 step to the right (perpendicular) and 1 step forward. So relative directions:

If the agent is facing north, the wall 3 steps forward is north. The wall 2 steps left is west. The blue box is east (1 step right) and north (1 step forward). Wait, but east and north from the agent's current position would be northeast. So the blue box is diagonally northeast, 1 step east and 1 step north.

But the agent can't move diagonally. So the agent needs to turn right (east) and then go forward to reach the blue box. But if the agent turns right, they'd be facing east. Then moving forward once would get them to the blue box. But the blue box is 1 step right and 1 step forward. So perhaps the agent is facing north, and to get to the blue box, they need to turn right (east) and then move forward once. Alternatively, they could turn left (west) but that's a wall 2 steps away. Wait, the wall to the left is 2 steps, but turning left would face west, where there's a wall 2 steps. So that's not helpful.

Wait, maybe the agent is facing a different direction. Let's assume the agent is facing north. The wall 3 steps forward is north. The wall 2 steps left is west. The blue box is east (1 right) and north (1 forward). So to get to the blue box, the agent needs to turn right (east) and then go forward once. But moving right (east) from the agent's position would align them to face east, but the blue box is east and north. So after turning right, moving forward once would take them east 1 step, but the blue box is also north 1 step. Wait, that doesn't add up. If they turn right (east), then moving forward would take them east, not north. So the blue box is northeast, which would require moving east then north, or north then east. But the agent can only move in straight lines.

Wait, perhaps the blue box is positioned such that from the agent's current position, turning right (east) and then moving forward 1 step would place them next to the blue box, which is 1 step north and 1 step east. But that's not possible because moving east would take them east, and then they need to move north. Unless the blue box is directly in front after turning east. Wait, maybe the observation is that the blue box is 1 step right (east) and 1 step forward (north), meaning that from the agent's current position, if they turn right (east), the blue box is 1 step forward (east) from there? No, that would make the blue box 1 step east of the agent's current position. But according to the observation, it's 1 step right and 1 step forward. So right and forward from the agent's current direction.

Wait, maybe the agent is facing north. Right turn would face east. Then, the blue box is 1 step right (east) and 1 step forward (north from agent's original position). So if the agent turns right (east), then moves forward, they would be east 1 step from their original position. But the blue box is north 1 step and east 1 step. So that's not in front of them after turning east. Therefore, perhaps the agent needs to first turn left (west) but there's a wall 2 steps west. Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to turn around? But that's complicated.

Alternatively, maybe the agent should move forward towards the wall, but that's not helpful. The problem is that the blue box is diagonally northeast, which the agent can't reach directly with straight moves. So perhaps the agent needs to adjust their direction first.

Wait, but according to the rules, the agent must pick up a blue box before going to another. So the priority is to pick up the first blue box. The current observation shows a blue box at 1 step right and 1 step forward. So how can the agent reach it?

If the agent is facing north, to get to the blue box (1 right, 1 forward), they need to turn right (east) and then move forward once. But moving east would take them to the position where the blue box is east 1 step, but the blue box is also north 1 step from the original position. So perhaps the agent needs to move forward once (north) towards the wall, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe the agent should turn left (west), but there's a wall 2 steps left. Hmm.

Wait, the agent needs to pick up the blue box. The blue box is 1 step right and 1 step forward. So from the agent's current position, if they turn right (east), they can move forward to reach the blue box. But the blue box is 1 step right and 1 step forward. So after turning right, moving forward once would place them at the blue box's position. Wait, but the blue box is 1 step right and 1 step forward from the agent's current position. So if the agent turns right (east), then moves forward, they would be 1 step east, which is 1 step right from the original position, but the blue box is also 1 step north. So that doesn't align. Maybe the observation is described differently.

Alternatively, the blue box's position is 1 step to the right (east) and 1 step forward (north) from the agent's current direction. So if the agent is facing north, the blue box is northeast. To get there, the agent needs to move east then north, or north then east. But since movement is only forward or in the current direction, the agent must adjust their heading.

If the agent turns right (east), then moves forward, they would be east 1 step. Then, they need to turn north (which would require another turn, like turn left) and move forward. But that's two turns and two moves. However, the agent's goal is to pick up the blue box, so maybe they can do it in fewer steps.

Alternatively, if the agent first moves forward towards the wall, but that's not helpful. Wait, the wall is 3 steps forward. So moving forward once would reduce that to 2 steps. But the blue box is 1 step forward and 1 step right. Maybe the agent should first turn right, then move forward to reach the blue box. Let's see:

1. Turn right (now facing east).
2. Move forward once. Now the agent is east 1 step from original position.
3. Now, the blue box is 1 step north from here. But the agent is facing east. To go north, they need to turn left (north).
4. Move forward once to reach the blue box.

But that's three actions: turn right, go forward, turn left, go forward. However, maybe there's a shorter path.

Alternatively, if the agent turns left (west), but there's a wall 2 steps west. So that's not useful. If the agent turns around (180 degrees), facing south, but then the wall is 3 steps north, which would be 3 steps south, but there's no mention of a wall there. The observation only mentions walls forward and to the left.

Wait, the current observation says a wall 3 steps forward and a wall 2 steps left. If the agent turns right (east), there's no wall mentioned in that direction, so they can move forward. Then, after moving east, they can turn north (left) and move forward to reach the blue box.

But the problem is that in the current observation, the blue box is 1 step right and 1 step forward. So after turning right and moving forward once, the agent is at the position that is 1 step east. Then, the blue box is 1 step north from there. So the agent needs to turn left (now facing north) and move forward once to reach the blue box.

But how does the observation describe the blue box's position after moving? Maybe the agent needs to first adjust their direction to face north-east, but since they can't move diagonally, they have to do it in two steps.

Alternatively, maybe the blue box is directly in front after turning right and then moving, but that doesn't seem to fit the observation.

Wait, maybe the agent is facing north, and the blue box is 1 step to the right (east) and 1 step forward (north). So from the agent's current position, if they turn right (east), then move forward once, they would be at (east 1, north 0). The blue box is at (east 1, north 1). So they need to move north again. But to do that, they have to turn left (north) and move forward. So the sequence would be turn right, go forward, turn left, go forward, then pick up.

But in the current observation, after turning right and moving forward once, the blue box's position would be 1 step forward (north) from that new position. So yes, the agent can then pick it up.

However, in the current observation provided, the agent hasn't picked up any box yet. So the priority is to reach the blue box and pick it up.

But the previous actions were turning left and right, sometimes moving forward. Let's check the latest observation again:

Observation:
a wall 3 steps forward
a wall 2 steps left
a blue box 1 step right and 1 step forward

The agent needs to get to that blue box. Let's think about possible actions.

If the agent turns right (east), then moves forward, they would be facing east, 1 step away from the original position. Then, the blue box is 1 step north from there. To get there, they need to turn left (north) and move forward. But before that, they need to toggle or pick up. Wait, no, the toggle action is for interacting with objects in front. So once they reach the blue box, they can pick it up.

So the steps would be:

1. Turn right (east)
2. Go forward (now facing east, 1 step from original)
3. Turn left (north)
4. Go forward (now at the blue box's position)
5. Pick up

But in the current observation, after turning right and moving forward, the agent would be facing east. Then, the blue box is 1 step north and 1 step east from the original position, which would mean from the new position (east 1), the blue box is 1 step north. So moving forward north would reach it.

But the problem is that the agent's current observation shows the blue box at 1 step right and 1 step forward. So if the agent is facing north, turning right (east) makes them face east. Then moving forward would take them to the position that is 1 step east. Now, from there, the blue box is 1 step north (forward from this new direction). So yes, that makes sense.

So the correct sequence would be turn right, go forward, then turn left (to face north), go forward, then pick up.

But the agent needs to output one action at a time. So in the current observation, what action should the agent take first?

The current observation is after a previous default go forward action. The agent is facing north, with a wall 3 steps forward, a wall 2 steps left, and the blue box 1 step right and 1 step forward.

So the agent needs to turn right to face east. That would allow them to move forward towards the blue box's position. Alternatively, they could turn left, but that's a wall.

So the best action here is to turn right. Then, in the next step, go forward. But the agent has to choose one action now.

Alternatively, the agent could try to move forward, but that's towards the wall (3 steps away). So moving forward would hit the wall, which isn't useful.

Therefore, the correct action is to turn right to face east, which allows them to proceed towards the blue box.

14,Failed to obtain a valid action from the reasoning.,"<reasoning>
Let's start by understanding the problem. The goal is to go to a blue box after picking up a blue box. That's a bit confusing. The user needs to pick up a blue box first and then go to another blue box. Or is it to go to a blue box only after having already picked one up? The original instruction says ""go to a blue box after you pick up a blue box."" So the sequence is: pick up a blue box first, then go to another blue box. But maybe there's only one blue box? Or multiple?

Looking at the current observation: there are two blue boxes. One is 1 step left and 1 step forward, and another is 1 step right and 4 steps forward. The agent has to pick up one blue box and then go to the other. But the first step is to pick up a blue box. So the agent needs to navigate to one of the blue boxes, pick it up, then go to the other.

But in the current observation, the agent is facing a direction where the blue boxes are located. Let's check the walls. There's a wall 5 steps forward and a wall 3 steps left. So the agent's current orientation is such that moving forward 5 steps hits a wall, and moving left 3 steps also hits a wall.

The blue box that's 1 step left and 1 forward is probably adjacent. The other is further away. To pick up the closer blue box (1 left, 1 forward), the agent might need to turn left or right to face it. Let's think about the agent's current direction.

Since there's a wall 5 steps forward and a wall 3 steps left, the agent's direction is probably such that forward is blocked by a wall. Let's assume the agent is facing north. Then, to the left (west) there's a wall 3 steps away. The blue box is 1 step left (west) and 1 step forward (north). So the agent is at a point where west 1 and north 1 is a blue box. To get there, the agent needs to turn left (west) and then move forward. But before moving, they need to check if that's possible.

Wait, the observation lists ""a blue box 1 step left and 1 step forward."" So relative to the agent's current position and facing direction, left is west and forward is north. So the blue box is to the northwest. The agent is facing north, with a wall 5 steps forward (north) and a wall 3 steps left (west). So the agent's current position is at a point where moving north would hit a wall in 5 steps, and moving west would hit a wall in 3 steps. But there's a blue box at 1 step west and 1 step north. That suggests the agent is facing north, with the blue box immediately to the left (west) and forward (north). Wait, that can't be. If the agent is facing north, then left is west. So the blue box is 1 step west and 1 step north. That would mean it's diagonally northwest. But how can you have a blue box in a diagonal direction? The observations list objects in straight directions (forward, left, right, behind) or combinations? The current observation lists ""a blue box 1 step left and 1 step forward,"" which is a combination. So the agent needs to face a direction where moving left and forward gets them to the blue box.

Alternatively, maybe the agent is facing east. Let's rethink. If the agent is facing east, then left would be north, and forward would be east. A blue box 1 step left and 1 step forward would be 1 step north and 1 step east, which is northeast. But the walls are 5 steps forward (east) and 3 steps left (north). So moving east 5 steps hits a wall, moving north 3 steps hits a wall. But the blue box is 1 north and 1 east. That's possible. So to reach that blue box, the agent needs to turn north (left) and then move forward. But wait, if the agent is facing east, turning left would face them north. Then moving forward 1 step would take them north, but they have a wall 3 steps north. So moving north 1 step is possible. Then moving east 1 step would take them to the blue box. But the blue box is 1 left and 1 forward from the current position. Hmm, maybe the agent needs to adjust their direction first.

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to turn right to face a different direction. Let's consider the possible actions. The agent needs to pick up a blue box first. The closest blue box is 1 left and 1 forward. To get there, the agent might need to turn left (if facing east) or turn right (if facing another direction). Let's assume the agent is facing north. Then left is west. The blue box is 1 step left (west) and 1 step forward (north). So from the agent's position, turning left (west) would face them west, but moving forward 1 step would be north? Wait, no. If the agent is facing north, left is west, right is east. So turning left would face them west. Moving forward from there would be west. But the blue box is 1 step west and 1 step north. That's a diagonal, which isn't possible with the given actions. The actions only allow moving forward, turning, etc., in straight directions. So maybe the blue box is in a straight direction but described as a combination. Wait, perhaps the observation is formatted such that ""1 step left and 1 step forward"" means that the blue box is located in a position that is 1 step to the left and 1 step forward from the agent's current position, but in the same line of sight. For example, if the agent is facing north, left is west, so 1 step left would be west, and 1 step forward would be north. But that's a diagonal, which might not be how the game works. Maybe the description is that the blue box is 1 step in the left direction and 1 step in the forward direction, meaning that from the agent's current position, the blue box is to the northwest. But the agent can only move in straight lines, not diagonally. So to reach that blue box, the agent would have to move left (west) 1 step and then forward (north) 1 step, but the walls are in the way.

Wait, the walls are 5 steps forward (north) and 3 steps left (west). So if the agent is facing north, moving forward 5 steps is blocked, but moving west 3 steps is blocked. The blue box is at 1 step west and 1 step north. So to get there, the agent would need to turn left (west) and move forward 1 step, then turn north? But that's not possible with the given actions. Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to turn right, move forward, then turn left, etc. This is getting confusing. Maybe the agent needs to navigate to the blue box by adjusting their direction and moving forward where possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the agent should first turn to face a direction where the blue box is directly in front. For example, if the agent turns left (west), then the blue box that's 1 step left and 1 forward would be 1 step forward from the agent's new position. Wait, if the agent is facing north and turns left (west), then their forward direction is west. The blue box is 1 step left (west) and 1 step forward (north) from the original position. But after turning left, the agent's forward is west. So the blue box's position relative to the agent after turning left would be 1 step forward (west) and 1 step north (which would be the agent's left direction). But the agent can't move north while facing west. So maybe that's not the right approach.

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to turn right. If the agent is facing north and turns right (east), then their forward direction is east. The walls are 5 steps east and 3 steps north (left). The blue box that's 1 step left and 1 forward would be 1 step north (left from east-facing agent) and 1 step east (forward). But again, moving east 1 step would be possible (since the wall is 5 steps east), but the blue box is 1 step north and 1 step east. That's a diagonal, which isn't allowed. So perhaps the agent can't reach that blue box directly.

This is getting a bit tangled. Let's recap. The agent's goal is to pick up a blue box and then go to another blue box. The current observation has two blue boxes. The agent needs to pick up one first. The closer one is 1 left and 1 forward. The other is further away. The agent must navigate to the first blue box, pick it up, then go to the second.

But the walls are blocking certain paths. Let's look at the current observation again:

- Wall 5 steps forward
- Wall 3 steps left
- Blue box 1 step left and 1 step forward
- Blue box 1 step right and 4 steps forward

Assuming the agent is facing north:

- Forward direction: north, blocked in 5 steps.
- Left direction: west, blocked in 3 steps.
- The blue box at 1 left (west) and 1 forward (north) is diagonally northwest. To reach it, the agent would need to move west 1 step and north 1 step, but can't move diagonally. So they'd have to move west first, then north, but moving west 1 step would take them to a position where north 1 step is possible (since the wall is 5 steps forward from the original position, which is now 4 steps north from the new position after moving west). Wait, the original wall is 5 steps forward from the starting position. If the agent moves west 1 step, their new position's forward direction is still north, but the wall is 5 steps north from the original position, which is now 4 steps north from the new position. So moving north 1 step from the new position would reach the blue box. But can the agent move west 1 step? The original observation says there's a wall 3 steps left (west) from the starting position. So moving west 1 step is possible, as it's not blocked. Then, from there, moving north 1 step would reach the blue box. However, the agent has to perform these actions in sequence: go west, then go north, then pick up. But the agent's current observation after moving west might change. Alternatively, maybe the agent can reach the blue box by turning left and moving forward.

Wait, if the agent turns left (west), their forward direction becomes west. The blue box is 1 step left (from the original position) and 1 forward (north). After turning west, the blue box is 1 step north (which would be the agent's left direction) and 1 step forward (west). So that's not directly in front. So the agent can't pick it up by moving forward. They would have to move north, but that's not a straight action. This is confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the agent should first turn right. If facing north, turning right (east), then forward direction is east. The blue box is 1 step left (north) and 1 forward (east). After turning east, the blue box is 1 step north (left) and 1 step forward (east). Again, not directly in front.

Hmm. Maybe the agent needs to toggle the blue box, but can only do so if they are facing it. Toggle is used to interact with objects in front. So to pick up the blue box, the agent must be facing it directly. So the blue box at 1 left and 1 forward must be in the agent's forward direction when they are facing appropriately.

Alternatively, perhaps the blue box is in front of the agent after turning. For example, if the agent turns left (west), then the blue box that's 1 step left and 1 forward from the original position would be 1 step forward (west) and 1 step north (left from the agent's new position). But the agent can't toggle something that's not directly in front. So they need to be facing the blue box.

This is getting complicated. Let's try to visualize the agent's position and surroundings.

Assume the agent is at position (0,0), facing north.

- Wall 5 steps forward (north) would be at (0,5).
- Wall 3 steps left (west) would be at (-3,0).
- Blue box 1 step left (west) and 1 forward (north) is at (-1,1).
- Blue box 1 step right (east) and 4 steps forward (north) is at (1,4).

So the agent is at (0,0), facing north. The blue box at (-1,1) is diagonally northwest. To reach it, the agent would need to move west 1 step to (-1,0), then north 1 step to (-1,1), then pick up. But can the agent move west 1 step? The wall is at (-3,0), so moving west 1 step to (-1,0) is possible. Then moving north 1 step to (-1,1) is possible because there's no wall there. Then pick up.

Alternatively, the agent could turn left (west), then move forward to (-1,0), then turn north (which would be a 180-degree turn?), then move forward to (-1,1). But turning north from west would require turning right twice, which might not be efficient.

But the actions allowed are turn left, turn right, go forward, pick up, drop, toggle. So to get to (-1,1), the agent needs to:

1. Turn left (face west).
2. Go forward 1 step to (-1,0).
3. Turn left again (face north).
4. Go forward 1 step to (-1,1).
5. Pick up.

But that's a few steps. However, in the current observation, after turning left and moving forward, the new observation would change. The problem is that the agent's current observation might not have the blue box in front after turning, but in the original observation, the blue box is 1 left and 1 forward, which might mean it's in the agent's forward-left direction, not directly in front.

Alternatively, maybe the game allows objects to be in diagonal positions, and the agent can toggle them if they are in front. For example, if the agent is facing north, and the blue box is to the northwest, but the agent can toggle it by facing north and pressing toggle, even if it's not directly in front. But that's unclear from the problem description.

The problem says: ""Once the desired object you want to interact or pickup in front of you, you can use the 'toggle' action to interact with it."" So the object must be in front of the agent to toggle. Therefore, the agent must face the blue box directly before toggling (and thus picking up).

So for the blue box at (-1,1), the agent needs to face it directly. To face it, the agent could turn left (west) and then move forward 1 step, then turn north (left again), and then the blue box would be in front. But that's two turns and movements. Alternatively, the agent could turn around (180 degrees) to face south, but that's probably not useful.

Alternatively, maybe the agent can turn right (east), then move forward, then turn right again to face north, but that seems complicated.

Alternatively, the agent could turn left (west), move forward 1 step, then toggle. But in that position, facing west, the blue box at (-1,1) is 1 step north (left from the agent's new position). So not in front. So toggling wouldn't work.

This is quite challenging. Maybe the intended path is to first navigate to the blue box that's 1 step right and 4 steps forward. But that's further away, and the agent needs to pick up a blue box first. So perhaps the agent should focus on the closer blue box first.

Alternatively, maybe there's a misunderstanding in the problem statement. The goal is to go to a blue box after picking up a blue box. Does that mean the agent needs to go to any blue box (possibly the same one) after picking it up? Or a different one? The original instruction says ""go to a blue box after you pick up a blue box."" So likely, after picking up one, go to another.

But in the current observation, there are two blue boxes. The agent needs to pick up one and then go to the other.

Assuming the agent picks up the closer blue box first, then goes to the other.

So steps:

1. Navigate to the blue box at (-1,1).
2. Pick it up.
3. Navigate to the blue box at (1,4).

But how to get there given the walls.

Alternatively, perhaps the agent should first turn right to face east. Then move forward until they can navigate around the walls. But the wall is 5 steps forward (north) from the starting position, so if the agent is facing east, moving forward would be east, which is not blocked immediately. Wait, the wall 5 steps forward in the original observation is when facing north. If the agent turns right (east), their forward direction is east, and there's no mentioned wall in that direction. So maybe the agent can move east freely.

Wait, the current observation lists walls as ""a wall 5 steps forward"" and ""a wall 2 steps left"". The forward direction here is the agent's current facing direction. So if the agent is facing north, forward is north, left is west. If the agent turns right (east), then forward is east, and left is north. The walls are still in the same positions relative to the agent's starting point. So when facing east, the wall 5 steps forward (east) would be at (5,0), but the agent's starting position is (0,0). However, the original observation mentions a wall 5 steps forward and a wall 2 steps left. So if the agent turns right to face east, their forward direction is east, and left is north. Are there any walls in that direction? The original observation doesn't mention a wall to the east or north, only forward (north) and left (west). So perhaps when facing east, there are no immediate walls, so the agent can move forward freely.

If that's the case, the agent could turn right (east), move forward until they can navigate around the west wall. But the blue box at (-1,1) is west of the agent's starting position. To reach it, the agent would have to go west, but there's a wall 3 steps left (west) from the starting position. So moving west directly would hit the wall at (-3,0). But the blue box is at (-1,1), which is west 1 and north 1. So the agent needs to find","

a wall 4 steps forward

a blue box 1 step right and 3 steps forward",0,False
15,turn left,"<reasoning>
Let's try to figure out what to do here. The goal is to pick up a blue box and then go to another blue box. From the current observation, there are two blue boxes. One is 1 step left, and the other is 1 step right and 3 steps forward. There's also a wall 4 steps forward.

First, I need to pick up a blue box. But to pick it up, I have to be adjacent to it, right? Because the actions are about moving and interacting. So I can't pick it up from a distance. The two blue boxes are both nearby. Let's see:

The blue box 1 step left: if I turn left and go forward, I can reach it. Then pick it up. Then I need to go to the other blue box which is 1 step right and 3 steps forward. But after picking up one box, the goal is to go to the other blue box. Wait, the problem says ""go to a blue box after you pick up a blue box."" So the order is important: first pick up any blue box, then go to another blue box. But maybe there's only two, and after picking one, the other is the target.

But in the current observation, both blue boxes are present. So maybe I need to pick up one and then go to the other. So first, how to reach the blue box that's 1 step left. Let's check the direction. If the agent is facing a certain direction, but the observation doesn't specify the agent's current orientation. Hmm, the previous observations had walls in certain directions, but without knowing the agent's direction, it's a bit tricky. But maybe based on previous actions, we can infer the direction.

Looking back at the previous interactions, the user's observations and the actions taken. For example, earlier when the observation had walls in certain positions, the agent turned left or right. Maybe the agent's facing direction is changing based on previous turns. But without exact knowledge, it's hard. Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to navigate to the blue box that's 1 step left. To get there, if the agent is facing north, then left would be west, so turning left (towards west) and moving forward. Then pick up the box. Then, from there, need to go to the other blue box which is 1 step right and 3 steps forward. Wait, after picking up the left box, the agent is now facing west (if they turned left from original north). Then the other blue box is 1 step right (east) and 3 steps forward. So from that position, turning right to face east, then moving forward 3 steps. But there's a wall 4 steps forward in the original observation, but after moving, the walls might be in different positions.

Alternatively, maybe the other blue box is closer. Let's see. The blue box 1 step left is adjacent, so picking that up first. Then the other is 1 step right and 3 forward. But maybe there's a wall in the way. The original observation had a wall 4 steps forward, but after moving, the walls' positions relative to the agent's new position might change.

But the current observation doesn't mention any walls except the one 4 steps forward. Wait, the current observation given is:

Observation:
a wall 4 steps forward
a blue box 1 step left
a blue box 1 step right and 3 steps forward

So the agent is facing a direction where there's a wall 4 steps forward. The two blue boxes are in different positions relative to the agent. To pick up the blue box 1 step left, the agent needs to turn left and move forward once. Then pick it up. Once picked up, the goal is to go to the other blue box. So after picking up, the agent needs to navigate to the blue box that's 1 step right and 3 steps forward. 

But after turning left and moving forward to pick up the left box, the agent's new direction is left (west, assuming original direction was north). Now, the other blue box is 1 step right (east) and 3 steps forward. So from the picked up position, the agent would need to turn right (to face east), then move forward 3 steps. But wait, the original wall was 4 steps forward. If the agent is now in a new position, the walls' positions relative to the agent's current location would be different. However, the current observation doesn't mention any walls except the one 4 steps forward. So perhaps after moving towards the left box, the wall is no longer in the way. 

But the main point is to first pick up a blue box. The closest one is 1 step left. So the steps would be: turn left, go forward, pick up. Then from there, turn right, go forward 3 times to reach the other blue box. But the agent must ensure that the path is clear. Since the current observation after moving might not have walls blocking, but the original wall was 4 steps forward. If the agent is now facing west (after turning left and moving forward), the wall 4 steps forward would be in the west direction, which is behind the agent. So moving forward from there wouldn't hit the wall. 

Therefore, the correct action now is to first interact with the blue box 1 step left. Since the agent is not holding anything yet, the first step is to pick it up. So the actions needed are: turn left, go forward, pick up. The current observation lists the blue box 1 step left, so the agent needs to face that direction. Assuming the agent is facing north initially, turning left would face west, and moving forward 1 step would reach the blue box. Then pick it up. 

But the problem is that the agent's current orientation isn't specified in the observation. However, based on previous interactions, maybe the agent has been turning left multiple times, leading to a certain orientation. For example, in previous steps, the agent turned left multiple times, which could have rotated them 360 degrees, or to a different direction. Without knowing the exact direction, it's challenging. But given the latest observation, the agent needs to face the blue box 1 step left. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent is facing east, and the blue box 1 step left is to the north. But again, without knowing the agent's direction, it's hard. However, the previous actions suggest that the agent has been turning left and right to navigate around walls. 

In the current observation, the agent needs to pick up the blue box 1 step left. So the sequence would be: turn left to face the direction of the blue box, go forward, then pick up. 

So the first action should be to turn left. Then go forward. Then pick up. 

But the user is asking for the next action based on the current observation. The current observation is:

a wall 4 steps forward
a blue box 1 step left
a blue box 1 step right and 3 steps forward

So the agent is facing a direction where there's a wall 4 steps ahead. The blue box to the left is 1 step away. So to get to it, the agent needs to turn left (assuming that left is the direction towards the blue box) and then go forward. 

Therefore, the next action should be to turn left. Because the agent hasn't turned yet to face the blue box. Once turned left, then go forward, then pick up. 

But the agent's current orientation isn't given, so we have to assume based on previous actions. For example, in the previous observation, there was a wall 5 steps forward, and the agent turned left. Then next observation had a wall 6 steps forward, etc. It's possible that the agent is rotating left multiple times to avoid walls. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent is facing north, and the blue box to the left is west. So turning left (to face west) and moving forward. 

Given that the agent needs to pick up a blue box first, the priority is to get to the nearest one. The blue box 1 step left is the closest. So the action sequence is turn left, go forward, pick up. 

So the first action needed is to turn left. Then go forward, then pick up. 

But the user is asking for the next action based on the current observation. So the current observation shows the blue box 1 step left. Therefore, the agent needs to face that direction. If the agent is not already facing it, turning left is the correct action. 

Therefore, the next action should be to turn left. Then go forward, then pick up. 

But since the user is asking for the next action, the immediate action is to turn left to face the blue box. 

So the answer should be turn left.

Let's see. My goal is to pick up a blue box and then go to another blue box. I need to follow the instructions properly.

In the current observation, there's a wall 3 steps to the left, and a blue box 1 step forward. So I'm facing a direction where in front of me there's a blue box right next to me. Since I need to pick up a blue box first before going to another one, I should make sure I have that blue box in my inventory.

First step: I need to pick up the blue box that's one step forward. But before I can pick it up, do I need to face the correct direction? If the blue box is directly in front of me, then I can just use the 'pick up' action. But wait, maybe I'm not aligned properly. Let me check the observation again. The observation says ""a blue box 1 step forward"". That probably means it's directly in front. So if I'm facing the right direction, I can pick it up.

Wait, but what if I'm not facing forward? Let's think. The previous actions the agent took involved turning left and right to navigate. Maybe in the previous steps, the agent adjusted their direction to face the blue box. Now, according to the latest observation, the blue box is one step forward. So if the agent is facing the correct direction, they can just pick it up.

So the correct action here would be to pick up the blue box. Once picked up, the next step would be to go to the other blue box. But first, I need to execute the 'pick up' action. Let's confirm: the blue box is directly in front, so 'pick up' should work. There's no other objects in the way. The wall is 3 steps left, which doesn't interfere here.

So the action should be 'pick up' because that's the required first step. After picking up, the agent can navigate to the other blue box. But according to the current observation, the agent is at the position where there's a blue box one step forward. So the immediate action is to pick that up.

I need to make sure that the agent hasn't already picked up a box. Wait, the problem states that the goal is to go to a blue box after picking up a blue box. So the agent must have at least one blue box in their inventory before moving to the target. Therefore, the priority is to pick up the blue box currently in front.

Yes, so the correct action here is 'pick up'.
