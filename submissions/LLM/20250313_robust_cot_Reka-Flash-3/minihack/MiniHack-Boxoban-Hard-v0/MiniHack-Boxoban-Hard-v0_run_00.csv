The user is playing Boxoban, which is a Sokoban-like game. The goal is to push boulders onto fountains. The current observation includes inventory items, messages, language observations, cursor position, and the map.

First, I need to understand the map layout. The agent is at position (x=35, y=16). The map is a grid, but the given map seems a bit sparse. There are a lot of empty spaces, some bars mentioned in the language observations, and a boulder and fountains in various directions. The message says ""Salutations Agent, welcome to NetHack!"" which might be a bit confusing since it's Boxoban, but maybe it's a different version or a similar game.

The inventory has a lot of items, but I don't think they're relevant for pushing boulders. The key elements are the boulders and fountains. The goal is to push the boulder(s) onto the fountain(s). Let me check the language observations again. There's a boulder adjacent northeast and east, and a fountain very near northnortheast. So the boulder is close to the agent's current position. The agent needs to move towards the boulder and then push it towards the fountain.

Looking at the cursor position (35,16), the agent is in a room with some bars and possibly walls. The boulder is adjacent northeast and east. Let me parse the directions. The language observations mention ""boulder adjacent northeast and east."" So from the agent's position, northeast and east directions have a boulder. The fountain is very near northnortheast. So the fountain is in the northnortheast direction, which is a bit further away.

The agent should first move towards the boulder. Since the boulder is adjacent northeast, moving east would get closer. Let's check: east direction from (35,16) would be (36,16). If there's a boulder there, the agent can push it. But first, the agent needs to approach.

Wait, but the boulder is adjacent northeast and east. Maybe the agent is facing a different direction. The current observation doesn't mention the agent's facing direction. Without knowing the direction the agent is facing, it's a bit tricky. But in NetHack-like games, the agent's starting direction can vary. However, the message says ""You are a lawful male human Knight"" which might indicate the starting position and possible initial direction.

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to move east first to get next to the boulder. Let's assume that moving east will bring the agent next to the boulder. Once adjacent, the agent can push it. The direction to push would be towards the fountain. The fountain is northnortheast, which is a combination of north and east. So if the boulder is east of the agent, pushing it north or northeast might get it towards the fountain.

Wait, the fountain is very near northnortheast. If the boulder is east of the agent, pushing it north would move it towards the northeast direction. That might align it with the fountain. Let's plan the steps:

1. Move east to get next to the boulder.
2. Push the boulder north or northeast towards the fountain.

But first, confirm the exact position. The agent's current position is (35,16). If moving east to (36,16), and there's a boulder there, then pushing it north to (36,15) would head towards the fountain. Alternatively, pushing northeast to (37,15) might be better. However, the fountain is northnortheast, so moving the boulder in that direction would be ideal.

Wait, the fountain is very near northnortheast. So if the agent pushes the boulder northeast (east and north), that would take it closer. But the agent's current position is (35,16). Moving east once gets to (36,16), which is east. If the boulder is there, pushing it northeast would go to (37,15). Then maybe another push north to (37,14) and so on towards the fountain.

Alternatively, after pushing the boulder northeast, the agent might need to adjust direction. But first, the agent needs to move to the boulder's position. Let's check the possible actions. The available actions are north, east, south, west.

The agent is at (35,16). The boulder is adjacent northeast and east. So moving east once would reach (36,16), which is adjacent to the boulder. Then, pushing it. The direction to push the boulder would depend on where the agent wants it to go. Since the fountain is northnortheast, pushing the boulder northeast (if possible) would be better. But pushing requires that the space behind the boulder is unobstructed.

Assuming that after moving east to (36,16), the agent can push the boulder. The direction to push would be northeast (combining north and east). However, in Boxoban, you push by moving into the boulder, which then moves the boulder one space in the direction you're moving. So if the agent is at (36,16) and the boulder is there, moving northeast (which is to (37,15)) would push the boulder from (36,16) to (37,15). That direction is northeast, which is towards the fountain located northnortheast. So pushing the boulder northeast once would bring it closer.

Alternatively, if the agent first moves east to get next to the boulder, then pushes it north, moving the boulder to (36,15). Then, from there, moving northeast again. But perhaps pushing it northeast first is better.

However, the agent's current map shows some bars in various directions. The language observations mention bars near north, northnortheast, etc., so there might be walls or barriers. The agent needs to avoid moving into bars or dark areas unless they're passable.

Looking back at the language observations: ""bars near north, northnortheast, northeast, eastnortheast, eastsoutheast, and northnorthwest"". So moving north or northeast might hit bars (walls). The dark areas are in the far north, northeast, and east. The boulder is adjacent northeast and east, and the fountain is very near northnortheast.

So perhaps the best approach is:

1. Move east to get next to the boulder.
2. Push the boulder northeast towards the fountain.

But the agent needs to check if the path behind the boulder is clear. Since the fountain is in the northnortheast, pushing the boulder in that direction would align it with the fountain. However, there might be bars or other obstacles. The language observation says ""fountain very near northnortheast"", which suggests that the path to the fountain is somewhat clear.

Alternatively, after pushing the boulder northeast once, the agent might need to adjust. But first, the immediate action is to move towards the boulder.

So the first action should be to move east. Let's check if moving east is possible. The agent's current position (35,16) moving east to (36,16). The map's lines show some structures. For example, in the map section provided, row 8 (since y=16 might correspond to row 8 in the given map, but the map is a bit unclear). The map's 8th line (assuming rows start from top) has ""#.`..{.`.#"", which might indicate a path. However, the exact map is hard to parse due to the formatting.

But given the language observations, moving east is towards the boulder. So the agent should move east to get next to the boulder, then push it northeast towards the fountain.

Therefore, the chosen action is to move east.

The agent just moved east, and now the map shows that the stairs up are adjacent to the west. The agent is at (36,16), and there's a boulder adjacent to the north and east.

The goal is to push boulders onto fountains. The observation mentions fountains in east, eastnortheast, near eastnortheast, very near northnortheast. There's a boulder far eastnortheast and another near east. Also, a boulder adjacent north and east of the agent now.

Since the agent just moved east, they're closer to the east fountains. The stairs are to the west, but maybe getting to the fountains first is priority. The agent needs to push the boulder east into the fountain. But the boulder is adjacent to the east. Wait, current position is (36,16). If there's a boulder adjacent east, that would be (37,16). To push it, the agent needs to move into it from the west. So moving east towards the boulder, then pushing it east into the fountain.

But the agent's current position is (36,16). The adjacent east is (37,16). The boulder is there. So the agent should move east again to get next to the boulder, then push it east. But the agent just moved east, so maybe they are now at (36,16), and the boulder is at (37,16). Then the agent can move east again to be adjacent, then push (east again). But need to check if the tile behind the boulder is a fountain and not blocked.

Looking at the map, there's a fountain far east. The boulder near east might be adjacent to a fountain. So pushing it east would place it on the fountain. But the map shows that at (39,16), maybe? The exact positions aren't clear from the ASCII map provided, but the descriptions mention fountains near east and eastnortheast.

So the plan is: move east until next to the boulder, then push it east. Since the agent just moved east to (36,16), the next step is to move east again to (37,16), which is where the boulder is adjacent. Then push east to move the boulder onto the fountain.

But wait, the agent's inventory has a boulder adjacent north and east. Wait, the current observation says ""boulder adjacent north and east"". So in the map, the agent is at (36,16). North would be (36,15), and east is (37,16). So there's a boulder at (37,16) east of the agent. So to push it, the agent needs to move east into it, then push east again.

So first action: move east to (37,16). Then push east (action: east again, but that's a push). Wait, in NetHack/MiniHack, pushing a boulder is done by moving into it when there's space behind. So the correct action is to move east (which would push the boulder east if the space behind is free).

Wait, in the action list, the available actions are north, east, south, west. So to push the boulder east, the agent needs to move east, which would cause the boulder to move east into the next tile, provided that tile is a floor or a fountain and not blocked.

So the next step is to move east again. The agent is at (36,16), the boulder is at (37,16). Moving east to (37,16) would push the boulder east to (38,16), assuming that (38,16) is a valid space (like a floor or fountain). Since the fountain is near east, pushing the boulder there would solve the puzzle.

Therefore, the next action should be east to push the boulder towards the fountain.

Let's see what's going on here. The agent is in a Boxoban-like environment, pushing boulders onto fountains. The goal is to move the boulder (labeled as a boulder on the map) onto the fountain.

Looking at the current observation, the agent is at position (37, 16). The map shows that there's a boulder adjacent to the east and northwest. The fountains are very near eastnortheast and northnorthwest. The stairs up are very near the west, which might be the exit once the level is completed.

In the previous steps, the agent moved east three times, moving from (35,16) to (36,16) to (37,16). Now, the boulder is adjacent east and northwest. The current position is next to the boulder to the east. The fountain is eastnortheast, which is a bit further away. So, the agent is probably next to the boulder but needs to push it towards the fountain.

The agent's current position is (37,16). The boulder is adjacent east, so if the agent moves east again, they would be next to the boulder. To push the boulder, the agent needs to move into it while having a clear space behind it. The boulder is east of the agent, so the agent needs to move east, then east again to push the boulder. But first, check if there's space beyond the boulder. The map shows a fountain very near eastnortheast. So, after pushing the boulder east once, it would be at (38,16), and then pushing it again east to (39,16) would put it next to the fountain. However, the observations mention a dark area very near southeast, south, southwest, west, and northwest, which might block certain paths. But the immediate east direction after the boulder seems clear since the fountain is in eastnortheast.

So the plan is: move east twice to push the boulder towards the fountain. But wait, the agent is already adjacent to the boulder. Let's check the map again. The current map shows at (37,16) the agent is at position <@. The boulder is adjacent east. So the agent is at (37,16), the boulder is at (38,16). The fountain is at eastnortheast, which would be around (39,15) or similar, but exact coordinates are unclear from the map. The key is to push the boulder east until it's on the fountain.

First action: move east to get next to the boulder. Then, again move east to push it. However, the agent's previous actions were east, east, east. The last observation showed the boulder adjacent east and northwest. So after moving east to (38,16), then moving east again would push the boulder to (39,16). Then, perhaps move further east to align it with the fountain.

But the problem is that the agent needs to avoid repeating the same action. The tip says not to output the same action over and over if nothing changes. So maybe after moving east once, check if the next move is possible. However, the agent's current position is adjacent to the boulder, so moving east would push it. Let's confirm:

Current agent position: (37,16). Boulder is at (38,16). If the agent moves east to (38,16), then they are pushing the boulder east to (39,16). Then, moving east again from (38,16) would push the boulder to (39,16), which is towards the fountain. That seems like the right approach. So the next action should be east to push the boulder. But since the agent was already moving east previously, perhaps they need to confirm if the path is clear. The observations mention a fountain very near eastnortheast, which would be in the direction the boulder is being pushed. So, pushing the boulder east once should get it closer to the fountain. Then, maybe another push. But let's see.

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to navigate around obstacles. The dark areas might block certain paths, but in this case, the immediate east seems clear. The stairs up are to the west, which isn't needed yet. The priority is to get the boulder onto the fountain. So the next logical move is to push the boulder east. Therefore, the action should be east again, but that's repeating. Wait, the last action was east, moving the agent to (37,16). Now, the boulder is adjacent east. So moving east again would push the boulder. So the correct action is east. However, the user mentioned not to repeat the same action if nothing changes. But in this case, the agent needs to keep pushing the boulder. So maybe it's necessary to repeat east until the boulder is on the fountain.

Let me try to figure out what to do next. The agent has been moving east three times so far, and each time they ended up next to a boulder. The last attempt to move the boulder failed because they can't push it yet. Let me look at the map and the observations again.

From the map, the agent is at position (37, 16). The map shows a boulder adjacent to east and northwest. The previous messages mention that the boulder is very near east and northwest. So, if I'm standing at (37,16) and there's a boulder to the east (which would be at (38,16)), but trying to push it there failed. That probably means there's something blocking the other side. So maybe the boulder is stuck because there's a wall or another obstacle behind it.

The goal in Boxoban is to push boulders onto fountains. The current observations mention fountains near east and very near eastnortheast and northnorthwest. So the agent needs to get the boulder onto one of those fountains.

Looking at the boulder's position: adjacent east and northwest. If the boulder is at (38,16), then northwest would be (37,15). But the agent is at (37,16), so moving west would take them to (36,16), which is the stairs up. Maybe the boulder is at (38,16) with something behind it, preventing it from being pushed east.

Since the agent tried pushing east and failed, perhaps they need to move the boulder in another direction. The boulder is adjacent to east and northwest. If they can move it northwest (northwest from the boulder's position would be (37,15)), but the agent is currently at (37,16). So to get to the boulder's northwest, the agent would need to move north and west. Wait, but the agent's current position is (37,16). Moving north would take them to (37,15), which is adjacent to the boulder's northwest. Then maybe they can push the boulder north from there.

Alternatively, maybe the agent should move north to get into position to push the boulder. Let me check the map again. The map shows that at (37,16), the agent is in a room with some symbols like { and {. Maybe there are obstacles in certain directions. The language observations mention dark areas and bars, which might indicate walls or other blocking elements.

The agent tried moving east three times and each time got closer to the boulder. The last attempt to push it east failed, so they need to try a different direction. Since the boulder is adjacent to east and northwest, perhaps pushing it north or west would be better. If the boulder is blocked east, maybe pushing it north into a direction where there's space toward a fountain.

The fountains are very near eastnortheast and northnorthwest. If the boulder can be pushed to the northnorthwest fountain, that would solve the problem. To do that, the agent might need to move the boulder towards that direction. Let's think about the agent's current position and the boulder's location.

If the boulder is at (38,16) (east of the agent), pushing it north would take it to (38,15). Then the agent could push it further north into the fountain area. But first, the agent needs to get next to the boulder in the direction they want to push it. Since the agent is at (37,16), moving north to (37,15) would place them north of the boulder (assuming the boulder is at (38,16)). Wait, no: if the boulder is adjacent east, then it's at (38,16). So the agent is at (37,16), and the boulder is to the east. So moving north from the agent's current position would take them to (37,15), which is adjacent to the boulder's northwest (since the boulder is at (38,16), northwest from there is (38,15), but the agent is moving to (37,15), which is west of the boulder). Hmm, maybe this is confusing.

Alternatively, the agent could move west to (36,16), which is adjacent to the stairs up. But moving west might not help. The previous observations mention stairs up adjacent west, so that's at (36,16). The agent is already there. Wait, no: the agent moved east three times, so from (35,16) to (36,16) to (37,16). So stairs up are at (36,16), which is west of the agent's current position. But the agent can't go west past the stairs because they are adjacent. Maybe the stairs are up there, but the agent hasn't used them yet.

The key is to get the boulder onto a fountain. The fountain to the east is near, but the agent can't push the boulder there. So perhaps the agent needs to move the boulder in another direction. Let's see the boulder's adjacent directions: east and northwest. If the boulder is at (38,16), then northwest would be (38,15). The agent is at (37,16). So moving north to (37,15) would position the agent north of the boulder's current position. Then, if the agent pushes the boulder north (from the agent's perspective, pushing west?), but maybe the direction needs to be considered.

Wait, in MiniHack, the agent's movement is based on their orientation. The game typically uses the default direction where north is up on the screen. So if the agent is facing north, moving north would be up the screen. But the map's coordinate system might have y increasing upwards, so moving north increases y. Looking at the map, the agent's position is (37,16), and the map shows that moving north would take them up the screen. But the boulder is to the east (higher x-coordinate), so moving east increases x.

Assuming the standard coordinate system where y increases upwards and x increases to the right, the agent at (37,16) moving east would go to (38,16), north to (37,15), etc.

The boulder is adjacent east and northwest. So if the boulder is at (38,16), then northwest would be (38,15). The agent is at (37,16). To get to the boulder's northwest, the agent would need to move north to (37,15) and then east to (38,15). But moving east from (37,15) would take the agent to (38,15), which is the boulder's northwest. Then, from there, the agent could push the boulder west into (38,14), perhaps leading to a fountain.

But the agent's current position is (37,16). Let's outline the steps:

1. Move north to (37,15) to get north of the agent's current position.
2. Move east to (38,15), which is the boulder's northwest.
3. Push the boulder west (direction depends on the agent's orientation). Since the agent is facing east at (38,15), pushing west would move the boulder to (38,14).

But before that, the agent needs to navigate to (38,15). However, the previous messages indicate that there's a boulder adjacent east and northwest. Wait, the current observation says the boulder is adjacent east and northwest. So if the agent is at (37,16), the boulder is at (38,16) (east), and northwest of the boulder is (38,15). So to get to (38,15), the agent would need to move north to (37,15) and then east to (38,15).

But moving north from (37,16) to (37,15): is that possible? The map shows that at (37,16), moving north would lead to (37,15), which is part of the same room. The cursor shows the agent is at (37,16), and the map has a `.` at (37,15), which is probably a floor. So moving north is feasible.

Once the agent is at (37,15), then moving east to (38,15) would place them adjacent to the boulder's northwest. Then, pushing the boulder west (from the agent's perspective, pushing west would be the direction towards (38,14)), which might be clear if there's no obstacle there.

Alternatively, maybe there's a fountain to the northnorthwest. The agent could push the boulder in that direction. To do that, they might need to move the boulder north first.

But first, let's check if moving north is possible. The agent tried moving east three times and each time succeeded, except the last attempt to push the boulder. Now, the agent is at (37,16). Moving north to (37,15) is visible on the map as a floor (`.`), so that's safe.

So the next actions should be:

1. Move north to (37,15).
2. Move east to (38,15) (boulder's northwest).
3. Push the boulder west (action: west) to move it to (38,14).

This would free up the path for the agent and move the boulder towards a fountain. The fountains are very near eastnortheast and northnorthwest. If the boulder is moved to (38,14), which is north of its current position, there might be a fountain in that area. Alternatively, the agent could then move the boulder further north.

But before pushing, the agent needs to be adjacent to the boulder in the desired direction. So moving north and then east gets the agent next to the boulder's northwest. Then pushing west would move the boulder towards (38,14), which may lead to a fountain.

Given that the agent's last action was pushing east and failing, the next logical step is to try pushing the boulder in another direction. Moving north and then east and then pushing west seems like a plan.

So, the first action after the last observation is to move north. Let me check the current observation again. The agent is at (37,16). Moving north would take them to (37,15), which is a floor. Then moving east to (38,15), which is adjacent to the boulder's northwest. Then pushing west.

But the user is asking for the next action based on the current observation, which includes the message about failing to push the boulder east. So the agent needs to try a different direction. The next best action is to move north to position themselves to push the boulder west or north.

Therefore, the immediate next action should be to move north. Let's confirm the map again. The map at (37,16) shows a `@` symbol, and moving north would be to a `.` (floor), so that's safe. So the correct action is north.

Let's see where I am. The agent is at position (37, 16) moving east a few times. Then tried to push a boulder but couldn't. The latest observation shows the agent is now at (37, 15) after moving north.

Looking at the map, the agent is near some boulders and fountains. The goal is to push the boulders onto fountains. The current map shows a boulder adjacent southeast and west. There's a fountain adjacent northwest. So maybe moving towards the boulder to push it north or east into the fountain?

Wait, the language observation mentions a boulder adjacent southeast and west. But the agent is at (37,15), so the boulder's position might be (38,15) southeast or (37,14) west? Let me check. Moving north brought the agent to y=15 from y=16. The cursor is at (37,15). The adjacent boulders are southeast and west. Southeast would be (38,15), west is (37,14). 

The fountain is adjacent northwest, which would be (36,14). But pushing the boulder towards the fountain might require moving in a direction. Let's see. If the boulder is at (38,15) (southeast), maybe pushing it west into the fountain at (36,14) via some path. Or if the boulder is at (37,14) (west), pushing it north into the fountain.

But the agent is at (37,15). If the boulder is west (37,14), pushing it north would take it to (37,13). Is there a fountain there? The observations mention a fountain very near east, but maybe not directly north. Alternatively, pushing the southeast boulder towards the fountain in the northwest.

Wait, the fountain adjacent northwest is (36,14). So the agent is at (37,15). To get the boulder at (38,15) (southeast) to move west towards (36,15), but that's not directly towards the fountain. Maybe moving south to (37,16) where there's a boulder adjacent east and northwest. Hmm, maybe the agent needs to reposition.

Alternatively, the boulder to the west (37,14) can be pushed north to (37,13). If there's a path clear, that might lead it closer to a fountain. But the language observation says bars adjacent north and northeast. So moving north from (37,15) would hit a bar (obstacle). So maybe can't go north directly.

Wait, the bars adjacent north and northeast at (37,15). So moving north would be blocked by bars. So the agent can't go north from here. The boulder to the west (37,14) can be pushed north, but that direction is blocked. So perhaps move west to be next to the boulder and then push it east? Let's see:

If the agent moves west to (37,14), which has the boulder adjacent. Then, pushing the boulder east to (38,14). Then maybe from there push further east into a fountain. But where are the fountains? The fountain adjacent northwest is (36,14), so that's north of the agent's current position. If the boulder is moved east to (38,14), then pushing it north to (38,13) might get it closer to the fountain at (36,14)? Not sure. Maybe a different approach.

Alternatively, look for the stairs up at westsouthwest. The stairs are very near westsouthwest, so maybe at (36,14) or similar. The agent's goal in Boxoban is to push all boxes to goal positions (fountains here). The closest boulder is at (38,15) (southeast). Maybe the agent should move southeast to get next to it and push it north or west. But the agent is at (37,15). Moving southeast would take to (38,16), but the map at (38,16) has a boulder adjacent east and northwest. Not sure.

Alternatively, the agent could move west to (37,14) where the boulder is adjacent west, then push it east into (38,14). Then from there, push it north or east. But need to check if there are obstacles. The bars are near various directions, but perhaps there's a path.

Wait, after moving west to (37,14), the boulder is there. Pushing it east to (38,14). Then from (38,14), maybe push it north to (38,13) if that's clear. Then see if there's a fountain nearby. The fountain at (36,14) is northwest of (38,14), so pushing the boulder northeast might not help. Alternatively, pushing it east towards the fountain in the east.

But the fountain is far east, as per earlier observations. Maybe the agent needs to navigate to that area. However, there are dark areas and bars blocking the path. The best approach is to focus on the nearest boulder and fountain.

Another thought: The agent is at (37,15). The fountain is adjacent northwest at (36,14). The boulder to the west is at (37,14). If the agent moves west to (37,14), then pushes the boulder east to (38,14), then pushes it north to (38,13), then east to (39,13), and so on until it reaches the fountain. But need to check if the path is clear.

Alternatively, maybe the boulder at (38,15) (southeast) can be pushed north into (38,14), then east to (39,14), etc. But again, path obstacles are a concern.

The latest message said that moving the boulder failed, but that was when trying to push it while adjacent. Maybe the agent isn't next to the boulder anymore. Wait, in the previous steps, after moving east three times, the agent was at (37,16), tried to push a boulder but failed. Then moved north to (37,15). Now, the boulder adjacent southeast and west. So at (37,15), the boulder to the southeast is (38,15), and to the west is (37,14).

Since the agent is at (37,15), to push the boulder at (38,15) (southeast), the agent needs to move southeast to be adjacent. But moving southeast would take to (38,16), which might have a boulder there. Alternatively, move east to (38,15) and then push north or west.

Wait, the agent is at (37,15). Moving east once gets to (38,15), which has a boulder adjacent east and northwest. So if the agent moves east to (38,15), then checks the boulders there. The boulder adjacent east would be (39,15), and northwest is (38,14). Pushing the boulder east from (38,15) to (39,15) might be possible if the path is clear. Then continue pushing towards the fountain.

Alternatively, push the boulder at (38,15) north to (38,14). If that's possible, then from there move towards the fountain.

But first, the agent needs to get next to the boulder. So from (37,15), moving east to (38,15) is a good first step. Then check the boulders there. The observation says boulder adjacent east and northwest at (38,15). So pushing east would take the boulder to (39,15), which might be clear. Then from (39,15), push further east towards the fountain.

Alternatively, pushing the boulder at (38,15) north to (38,14). If that's possible, then maybe that's a better path towards the fountain at (36,14). But the path from (38,14) to (36,14) is west, which might be blocked by bars.

Hmm. This is a bit complex. The priority is to get the boulder onto the fountain. The nearest fountain is adjacent northwest at (36,14). So the boulder needs to be moved to (36,14). But how?

If there's a boulder at (37,14) (west of agent), pushing it east to (38,14), then north to (38,13), then west to (37,13), etc., but that might not lead to the fountain. Alternatively, the boulder at (38,15) can be moved west to (37,15), but the agent is already there. Wait, no—(38,15) is east of the agent. So if the agent moves east to (38,15), then pushes the boulder west to (37,15), but the agent is there. That would not work.

Alternatively, push the boulder at (38,15) north to (38,14). Then from (38,14), push it north again to (38,13), and then west to (37,13), and so on until reaching (36,14). But each move requires checking for obstacles.

Alternatively, maybe the best immediate action is to move east to (38,15) and try to push the boulder there. Let's proceed with that.

Let's see what's going on here. The agent is in Boxoban, trying to push boulders onto fountains. The goal is to navigate correctly to push the boulders where they need to go.

Looking at the current observation, the agent is at position (38,15). The map shows a few key elements. To the east, there's a boulder, and to the southeast is a fountain. The stairs up are to the westsouthwest, so maybe that's the exit once the level is completed. 

In the previous steps, the agent moved east multiple times but hit a boulder when trying to push it. The message said, ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" So the last attempt to push the boulder east failed because there's something blocking the way. The boulder is adjacent to the agent's current position (east) and northwest. Wait, the latest map shows the boulder adjacent southeast and south. Hmm, maybe I need to check the latest map details again.

The map shows the agent's position as (38,15) with the symbol '<' indicating the direction they're facing. The line below has ""#<..``{.{#"". The '<' is at position (38,15), and the boulder is probably to the east, but when the agent tried to move east, the boulder wasn't moved because there's an obstacle. Wait, the message after the east move was about failing to move the boulder. So the boulder must be adjacent but not directly in front? Maybe there's a wall or another obstacle behind the boulder.

Looking at the language observations, there's a boulder very near west. Wait, the latest observation says ""boulder very near west"" but the agent is at (38,15). If the boulder is very near west, that would be to the west of the agent's current position. But earlier moves were eastward. Wait, maybe the map's orientation is different. Let me parse the map again.

The map lines from north to south. Each line represents a row. The agent's position is (38, y=15), so the fifth line from the bottom (since y=15 is the fifth line in the given map). The fifth line in the map is ""#<..``{.{#"". The '<' is at the start of this line, indicating the agent is facing north? Wait, in NetHack, the direction the agent is facing affects the map display. The '<' usually means the agent is facing north. So the agent is facing north, with the map lines going from north (top) to south (bottom). So moving east would increase the x-coordinate, and moving south would increase the y-coordinate.

In the current map, the agent's position is (38,15), and the line at that y-coordinate (5th line from the bottom) shows ""#<..``{.{#"". The '<' is at position 38 (assuming x starts at 0 or 1?), but the details might be a bit confusing. The boulder is mentioned as adjacent southeast and south. So east and south of the agent's current position.

Wait, the latest language observation says ""boulder adjacent southeast and south"". So the boulder is to the southeast and south of the agent. That would mean, relative to the agent's position (38,15), the boulder is at (39,15) (south) and (38,16) (southeast)? Or maybe (39,16) for southeast? Depending on how the coordinates work.

But the agent's last move was east, which took them to (37,16) initially, then further east to (38,16), but then when they tried to move east again, they hit a boulder. Wait, looking back at the previous steps:

First, the agent moved east to (36,16), then to (37,16), then tried to move east again but hit a boulder (message says they tried to push the boulder but failed). So the boulder was at (38,16), and the agent was at (37,16) when they tried to push east. But now the agent is at (38,15) after moving north.

So the current position is (38,15). The boulder is adjacent southeast and south. So the boulder is at (38,16) (south) and (39,16) (southeast). But the agent is facing north, so moving south would take them to (38,16), which is where the boulder is. But the boulder can't be moved if there's something behind it. Wait, the message when they tried to move east before was because the boulder was blocked. Maybe the boulder is at (38,16), and to the east of that is a wall or another obstacle, preventing movement.

The goal is to push the boulder onto the fountain. The fountain is near eastsoutheast, so maybe at (39,17) or similar. The agent needs to position the boulder over the fountain. Since the boulder is at (38,16), the fountain is east of that. So the agent needs to move the boulder east from (38,16) to (39,16), then onto the fountain at (40,16), for example.

But the agent is currently at (38,15), facing north. To reach the boulder at (38,16), they need to move south. Let's see:

Current position: (38,15), facing north.

If the agent moves south to (38,16), they would be at the position of the boulder. But the boulder is there, so they can try to push it east. However, the previous attempt to push east failed because there was an obstacle. Maybe after moving south to the boulder's position, the agent can push it east if the path is clear.

Looking at the map, the line at y=16 (sixth line from the bottom) is ""#<..``{.{#"". Wait, no, the agent is now at y=15. The map lines are:

Line 9 (y=16): #<..``{.{# (but the agent moved north to y=15)

Wait, the map's lines might be in reverse order. Let me recheck:

The map section provided is:

Each line represents a row from north to south. The agent's current position is (38,15), which is the fifth line from the bottom (since y=15 is the fifth index if starting from 0). The fifth line is:

##.#######                                    
Which is the sixth line in the displayed map (since the first five lines are all ##########). Wait, perhaps the coordinate system is different. This part is a bit confusing, but the key is that the agent is facing north at (38,15), and the boulder is adjacent south and southeast.

So, to get to the boulder, the agent needs to move south once. Then, from there, try to push the boulder east. But when they tried to push east before, they hit an obstacle. Maybe after moving south to the boulder's position, they can check the path east.

Additionally, the fountain is near eastsoutheast, which would be to the east and south of the boulder. So after pushing the boulder east, the next step would be to move it further east onto the fountain.

So the plan is:

1. Move south to (38,16) to reach the boulder.
2. Push the boulder east to (39,16).
3. Continue pushing east until it's on the fountain.

But before that, the agent needs to navigate to the boulder's current position. Since the agent is at (38,15) facing north, moving south once would get them to (38,16), where the boulder is. Then, attempt to push east.

But in the previous attempt, when the agent was at (37,16) and tried to move east, they couldn't because the boulder was blocked. So maybe after moving south to (38,16), the path east is clear.

Looking at the language observation, there's a boulder adjacent southeast and south. So at (38,16), the boulder is there. To the east of that (39,16) would be the direction to push. The map at y=16 (sixth line from the bottom) is ##.#######, which is a row of walls. Wait, that can't be right. Maybe the map's display is different. Alternatively, perhaps the agent needs to check the surroundings when they get to the boulder's position.

Alternatively, maybe the agent should first move east to get closer to the boulder. Wait, the current position is (38,15). If the boulder is adjacent south and southeast, moving south would take the agent to (38,16), which is the boulder's position. Then, pushing east from there.

But the problem is that when the agent tried to push east before, there was an obstacle. So perhaps after moving south to the boulder, they can check the tile east of the boulder to see if it's a floor and not blocked.

In the current language observation, there's a fountain very near eastsoutheast. So the fountain is in that direction. The agent needs to get the boulder there.

Another possibility is that the stairs up are near westsouthwest, so maybe after placing the boulder on the fountain, the agent can go up the stairs. But the immediate goal is to push the boulder.

So the next logical step is to move south to the boulder's location and then try to push it east. Let's check if moving south is possible.

The agent's current position is (38,15). Moving south would take them to (38,16). The map line for y=16 is ##.#######, which seems like walls. Wait, that might be a wall preventing movement. But the agent is a knight, so perhaps they can break through walls, but in Boxoban, you can't destroy walls; you can only push boulders around.

If moving south is blocked by a wall, then the agent can't proceed that way. But according to the language observation, there's a boulder adjacent south, so the south direction from (38,15) should be the boulder, not a wall. Maybe the map's display is confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the '##.#######' line represents walls, so the agent can't move south into them.

Wait, the map line for y=15 (the agent's current position) is the fifth line from the bottom, which is ##.#######. The agent is at (38,15), which is near the end of that line. If the line is ##########, then perhaps the agent is in a corridor. But the presence of a boulder adjacent south suggests that moving south is possible.

This is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should focus on the language observations. The latest language observation says:

- boulder adjacent southeast and south
- fountain very near eastsoutheast and westnorthwest
- stairs up very near westsouthwest

So the boulder is to the south and southeast of the agent. The agent is facing north at (38,15). To reach the boulder south, move south once. Then, from there, push east towards the fountain.

Assuming that moving south is possible (not into a wall), the next action should be 'south' to get to the boulder. Then, attempt to push it east.

But before committing to 'south', let's check if there's any other immediate action. The agent has a sword and a lance, but inventory items probably aren't needed right now since the task is pushing boulders.

Another possibility: the agent might need to reposition themselves to get a better angle to push the boulder. For example, moving east a bit more to get to a position where they can push the boulder south or east.

Wait, the agent is at (38,15). If they move east to (39,15), then they could face the boulder which is at (38,16). From there, moving south into (39,16) and then pushing west into the boulder? No, that's not efficient.

Alternatively, moving south to (38,16) (the boulder's position) and then pushing east. But earlier attempts to push east failed, indicating an obstacle. So maybe after moving south, the agent should check the tile east of the boulder (39,16) to see if it's a floor (.) or a wall (#).

If it's a floor, then pushing east is possible. If it's a wall, then the boulder can't be moved that way. According to the map, the line for y=16 is ##.#######, which would be a row starting with ##, then .#######. So at x=38, y=16, the tile might be a wall ('#'), but that's conflicting with the boulder being adjacent south.

This is a bit confusing. Maybe the map's display is not to scale, and the actual tiles are different. Given the uncertainty, the safest next step is to move south to the boulder's location and then try to push it east. If moving south is blocked, then the agent needs to adjust.

Alternatively, the agent could move east again, but they were at (38,15) after moving north. Moving east from there would take them to (39,15). Then, from there, perhaps they can move south to (39,16) and attempt to push the boulder west into that position. But that might not be the most efficient path.

Another angle: the fountain is near eastsoutheast. So the boulder needs to be pushed east-southeast. The agent's current position is west of the boulder. So pushing the boulder east first, then south, or south then east, depending on the layout.

Given the previous failed attempt to push east, the obstacle might be south of the boulder. So after moving south to the boulder, pushing east would require that the path is clear. If the fountain is east of that, then pushing the boulder east should work.

In conclusion, the next logical steps are:

1. Move south to reach the boulder.
2. Push the boulder east towards the fountain.

Since the agent is at (38,15) facing north, moving south once would get them to (38,16), where the boulder is. Then, pushing east would be the next action.

Let me try to figure out what to do next here. The agent is in a Boxoban-like environment, trying to push boulders onto fountains. Let's see the current state.

The agent is at position (38, 15). The last action was moving south, and now there's a message saying trying to move a boulder failed. The boulder is near the east, and fountains are eastsoutheast and westnorthwest. The agent just tried pushing something but couldn't, probably because the boulder is blocked or not in front of them.

Looking at the map, the agent's current position is marked with <. The boulders are adjacent to southeast and south. The fountains are very near eastsoutheast and westnorthwest. The stairs up are near westsouthwest, but maybe that's not relevant right now.

The inventory has a lance and sword, but pushing boulders doesn't require attacking. The agent needs to navigate to the boulder, push it toward a fountain. The last attempt to push failed, so maybe the boulder is not adjacent in the direction the agent tried. Let's check the map again.

The agent is at (38,15). The boulder adjacent to southeast and south. So if the agent is facing south, moving south again might hit the boulder. Alternatively, moving east could reach the boulder, but earlier attempts to move east resulted in hitting something. Wait, in previous steps, moving east when there was a boulder adjacent caused the message about failing to move it. 

Wait, the message here says ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" That probably happened when the agent tried to push the boulder south, but it's blocked. Maybe the boulder is against a wall or another obstacle. The agent needs to position themselves so they can push the boulder in the right direction.

Looking at the map symbols: `{` might represent a boulder, `.` is floor, `<` is the agent. So in the current map, the agent is at (38,15) with the boulder adjacent to southeast and south. So perhaps the boulder is at (38,16) or (39,15). The agent tried moving south to (38,16), but there's a boulder there. So to push it, the agent needs to be beside it and move towards the direction where there's space. 

If the boulder is at (38,16), pushing north would be possible if the space north of the boulder (38,15) is free. But the agent is already at (38,15), so pushing the boulder north would require moving the agent north, but they can't push from inside. Wait, in Sokoban-like games, you push by moving into the boulder, which then moves into the next tile. So if the agent is at (38,15) and the boulder is at (38,16), then moving south onto the boulder would push it to (38,17), but only if (38,17) is a free space. However, if the boulder is adjacent southeast and south, maybe it's at (39,15) and (38,16). Hmm, the map isn't super clear, but the language observations mention boulders near east and very near west.

In the current observation, after moving south to (38,15), the boulder is adjacent southeast and south. The agent is trying to push it, but failing. So maybe the boulder is in a corner or blocked. The agent needs to find a way to position themselves so they can push the boulder towards the eastsoutheast fountain.

Looking at the fountains, the very near eastsoutheast fountain would be at a position like (40,17) or similar. The boulder needs to be moved there. Since the agent is at (38,15), perhaps moving east to (39,15) and then pushing the boulder south or east. But earlier attempts to move east resulted in the boulder being there. Wait, in the previous steps, moving east when the boulder was adjacent caused the agent to be next to it, then trying to push resulted in failure. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent should move west to get around the boulder. The stairs are up near westsouthwest, but that might not help. The other boulder is very near west, so maybe at (37,15). If the agent moves west to (37,15), they can then try to push that boulder. But the agent's current position is (38,15), and moving west would take them to (37,15), which has a boulder adjacent southeast and south. Wait, no—the language observation says ""boulder very near west,"" so perhaps at (37,15). If the agent moves west, they might be next to that boulder and can try to push it east.

Wait, the current observations after moving south show that the boulder is adjacent southeast and south. So, the agent is at (38,15), and the boulder is either to the southeast (39,16) or south (38,16). Let's assume the boulder is at (38,16) (south direction). To push it north, the agent would need to move south into it, pushing it to (38,17). But if (38,17) is a wall or another obstacle, that won't work. Alternatively, if the boulder is to the southeast (39,16), then moving east into it would push it to (40,16), which might be towards the fountain at eastsoutheast.

But the agent's last action was moving south, leading to this position where they tried to push and failed. So perhaps the boulder is in the way. The agent should try to move in a direction that allows them to push the boulder away from obstacles.

Another approach: check the adjacent tiles. The agent is at (38,15). Adjacent tiles:

- North: (38,14) – possibly a wall or bar?
- East: (39,15) – boulder is adjacent southeast and south, so maybe the boulder is at (39,16)?
- South: (38,16) – boulder is there.
- West: (37,15) – there's a boulder very near west, so maybe at (37,15).

Wait, the language observation mentions ""boulder very near west,"" so perhaps at (37,15). If the agent moves west to (37,15), they can then try to push that boulder east towards the fountain. Alternatively, move east to (39,15) and see if there's a path.

But earlier, moving east when the boulder was adjacent caused the message about failing. So maybe the agent needs to approach the boulder from the correct side. For example, if the boulder is at (38,16) (south), the agent is at (38,15). To push it north, they need to move south into it. But that would require being at (38,15) and moving south to (38,16), which is the boulder's position. Then, pushing it north to (38,14), but if (38,14) is a wall or bar, that's not possible.

Looking at the map, the bars are in various directions. The bars very near north, etc., might indicate walls or obstacles. The agent's current map shows a lot of ########## which are probably walls. The agent's position is near the right side of the map, so maybe moving west is safer.

Alternatively, the agent could try to move northeast or southeast to find an opening. But the language observations mention dark areas in various directions, which could mean unseen obstacles.

Given the previous actions and the current state, perhaps the best move is to move west to (37,15) where there's a boulder very near west. Then, try to push that boulder east towards the fountain. That would involve moving west, then east into the boulder, pushing it towards the eastsoutheast fountain.

So the next action should be west to approach the other boulder.

7,Failed to obtain a valid action from the reasoning.,"<reasoning>
Let's try to figure out what the agent should do next. From the current observation, the agent is at position (37,15). The map shows that there's a boulder adjacent northeast and east. The previous actions were moving east multiple times, then north, south, and west. The last attempt to move east resulted in a message saying the boulder couldn't be moved, which makes sense because it's probably blocked by something.

Looking at the map, the agent is facing a situation where pushing the boulder east is blocked. The goal is to get the boulder onto a fountain. The fountain is very near east, so maybe the boulder needs to be positioned one step west of the fountain so that pushing it east would place it on the fountain.

In the current state, the boulder is adjacent northeast and east. The agent is at (37,15). If the boulder is east of the agent, then pushing it north, south, or west might position it better. But the message when trying to move east suggests that there's an obstacle blocking the boulder's path east, possibly another part of the environment or another boulder.

Looking at the language observations, there's a fountain very near east and eastnortheast. The boulder is very near eastsoutheast. Maybe the boulder is between the agent and the fountain. To get it to the fountain, the agent might need to move the boulder eastsoutheast first. However, the agent tried moving east earlier and failed, which could be because the boulder is stuck due to another obstacle.

Alternatively, the agent could try moving north or south to create a path. The cursor's position is (37,15), and there's a fountain adjacent to the northwest. Maybe moving northwest towards the fountain would be better. However, the stairs are up near westsouthwest, so perhaps that's a distraction.

Another approach: Since the boulder is adjacent northeast and east, the agent could try pushing it north or south. For example, if the boulder is to the east, pushing it north would move it to (37,14), which might free up the path. Alternatively, pushing it south to (37,16), but that might not lead to the fountain.

Wait, the fountain is very near east, so perhaps the boulder needs to be one tile away from the fountain to the west. If the boulder is at (38,15), then pushing it east to (39,15) would place it on the fountain. But the agent's last position was (38,15) after moving east, and trying to move east again resulted in the boulder being blocked. That suggests that at (38,15), the boulder is at (39,15), and there's something blocking it further east, like a wall or another boulder.

Therefore, to get the boulder to the fountain at (39,15), the agent needs to move it there step by step. Since pushing east from (38,15) failed, maybe the agent should move south or north to adjust the boulder's position. Alternatively, check if there's a way to push the boulder west first, but that's away from the fountain.

Alternatively, the agent could try moving north from (37,15) to (37,14) and then see if pushing the boulder east is possible. Let's see: moving north would place the agent at (37,14). Then, if the boulder is at (38,15), moving north-east (but the actions are only north, east, south, west) so maybe the agent needs to position themselves to push the boulder east from a different angle.

Alternatively, the agent could move west to (36,15) and then try to push the boulder east again. But the agent just came from west, and moving west again might not be helpful.

Hmm, the key here is to figure out the positions. The agent is at (37,15). The boulder is adjacent northeast and east. Assuming the boulder is to the northeast, that would be (38,16). Or if it's to the east, that's (38,15). But when the agent tried moving east from (38,15), it failed, suggesting the boulder is at (39,15) and blocked further east. So the boulder is at (39,15), and the agent is at (38,15). To push it east, the agent needs to be adjacent. So from (38,15), moving east to (39,15) and then pushing, but the message says it's blocked. So perhaps there's a wall or another boulder at (40,15).

Therefore, the agent needs to find a way to move the boulder around that obstacle. Maybe pushing it north or south first. If the boulder is at (39,15), pushing it north to (39,14) might create a path. The agent is at (38,15), so moving north to (38,14), then moving northeast (but there's no diagonal movement), so maybe moving east to (39,14) and then pushing north from there.

Alternatively, the agent could move south to (37,16) and then try to push the boulder from there. But this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, check if there's a way to interact with the fountain. The fountain is very near east, so at (39,15). The boulder is at (39,15), but it's blocked. So the agent needs to move the boulder to (39,14) or (38,15) so that pushing it east lands on the fountain.

Wait, if the boulder is at (39,15), and the agent is at (38,15), then the agent can try to push the boulder north to (39,14). To do that, the agent needs to be north of the boulder. So the agent moves north to (38,14), then moves east to (39,14), and then pushes north. But the boulder is at (39,15), so moving to (39,14) would allow the agent to push it north to (39,14) → (39,13)? Not sure.

This is getting a bit confusing. Let's recap:

- Agent is at (37,15).
- Boulder is at (39,15) (east of agent's previous position).
- Fountain is at (39,15), but the boulder is there, so it's not on the fountain.
- The message says ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" when the agent tried to move east from (38,15), indicating the boulder is at (39,15) and blocked further east.

So the goal is to push the boulder from (39,15) to (39,15) on the fountain. But it's already there. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe the fountain is at a different position. Let me check the language observations again.

The language observation says: ""fountain very near east"" and ""fountain very near eastnortheast"". Also, ""boulder very near eastsoutheast"". So the boulder is near eastsoutheast, which is (maybe) (39,16) or similar. The fountain is near east, which could be (39,15). So the boulder is at (39,16), and the fountain is at (39,15). To get the boulder onto the fountain, the agent needs to push it west to (39,15).

But the agent is at (37,15). The path from (37,15) to (39,15) is blocked by the boulder at (39,16). So the agent needs to move the boulder west from (39,16) to (39,15).

To do that, the agent should move towards the boulder. From (37,15), moving east to (38,15), then east again to (39,15), but the boulder is at (39,16). So the agent is at (39,15), next to the boulder at (39,16). Then, pushing the boulder west to (39,15) (the fountain). But the message when trying to move east from (38,15) indicates that the boulder is at (39,15) and blocked. Maybe there's a confusion in coordinates.

Alternatively, maybe the boulder is at (38,15), blocking the agent's path east. Then, to push it, the agent needs to be adjacent. If the boulder is at (38,15), and the agent is at (37,15), then moving east to (38,15) and pushing west would move the boulder to (37,15), which is where the agent is, which isn't possible. So perhaps the boulder is to the east of the agent's current position (38,15), meaning the agent is at (37,15), and the boulder is at (38,15). Then, trying to push it east would take it to (39,15), the fountain. But the message says it's blocked, so maybe there's a wall at (39,15) or another boulder.

This is tricky without the exact map layout. Looking at the map provided:

The relevant part of the map is:

                                  ##########                                    
                                  ##########

                                  ##########

                                  ##{####..#

                                  #<..``{.{#                                    
                                  ##########                                    

Assuming each line represents a row from top to bottom, and each character is a tile. The agent's position is (x=37, y=15). Let's try to parse the map row by row.

Row 8 (since y=15 might correspond to row 8 in the map display, depending on how it's indexed):

#.`.@{.`.#

This row has the agent (probably '@') at position x=37, which is the 7th character (if counting from 0). Let's count:

0: #
1: . 
2: `
3: .
4: @
5: {
6: .
7: `
8: . 
9: #

So the agent is at (37,15) which is position 4 in this row (0-based index 4). The boulder is mentioned in the language observation as adjacent northeast and east. Northeast would be (38,14) and east would be (38,15). But in the map, the next row (row 9, y=16) is:

So the agent was previously at (37,16) before moving south to (37,15). The boulder adjacent northeast (38,14) and east (38,15) would be in row 8, columns 5 and 6. Looking at row 8, positions 5 and 6 are '{' and '.' respectively. The '{' could represent a boulder. So the boulder is at (38,15) (x=38, y=15), which is east of the agent's current position (37,15).

Trying to move east from (37,15) to (38,15) would allow the agent to be adjacent to the boulder. Then, pushing the boulder east to (39,15) would place it on the fountain. However, the previous attempt resulted in the message ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" Why?

Perhaps because there's an obstacle at (39,15), such as a wall or another boulder. The fountain is at (39,15), so maybe it's blocked by a wall. Alternatively, the boulder is at (38,15) and when pushed east, it moves to (39,15), but that tile is blocked.

Looking at the map row 8 (y=15):

#.`.@{.`.#

At x=38 (position 5), it's '{', which is a boulder. So the boulder is at (38,15). To push it east, the agent needs to be at (38,15) and push east to (39,15). But the agent is at (37,15) and tried to move east to (38,15), which is possible, but then pushing from there east would be the next step. However, the previous attempt to move east from (38,15) (after moving there) resulted in the message that the boulder couldn't be moved. That suggests that when the agent was at (38,15), trying to push the boulder east (to (39,15)) failed because (39,15) is blocked.

Looking at row 8, x=39 (position 6) is '.', which is a floor tile. So if the boulder is at (38,15) and the agent is there, pushing east should be possible if (39,15) is a floor. But the message says it's blocked. Maybe there's a mistake in the map parsing.

Alternatively, the boulder might be at (39,15), and the agent is trying to push it further east, which is blocked. This is getting confusing. Maybe the agent needs to find another way to position the boulder.

Another possibility: The agent needs to move north or south to get the boulder into a position where it can be pushed towards the fountain. For example, moving north to (37,14) and then trying to push the boulder east from there.

Looking at row 7 (y=14):

#.`..{.`.#

At x=38 (position 5), it's '{', so the boulder is at (38,14). Wait, no—previous observations indicate the boulder is adjacent northeast and east of the agent's current position (37,15). So if the agent is at (37,15), northeast would be (38,14) and east would be (38,15). In row 8 (y=15), x=38 is '{', which is the boulder. So the boulder is at (38,15).

Thus, the agent is at (37,15), next to the boulder at (38,15). Trying to push it east to (39,15) fails because that tile is blocked. The fountain is at (39,15), so maybe there's a wall there. If that's the case, the boulder can't be placed on the fountain that way. Alternatively, the fountain is at a different coordinate.

Alternatively, the agent should try to move the boulder north or south. For example, pushing it north to (38,14), which is a '{' in row 7 (y=14), but that might be a wall. Looking at row 7: #.`..{.`.#. At x=38 (position 5), it's '{', which is a boulder. So the boulder is already there. That can't be right. There might be multiple boulders.

This is getting too complicated without a clear map. Maybe the best approach is to try pushing the boulder in a different direction. Since pushing east didn't work, try pushing north. From (38,15), the agent can push the boulder north to (38,14). But the agent needs to be adjacent to the boulder. So the agent moves east to (38,15), then pushes north to (38,14). If that's possible, then the boulder would be at (38,14), and the agent can then proceed to push it east from there.

But the agent's current position is (37,15). To get to (38,15), the agent needs to move east once. Then, from there, push north. However, the previous attempt to move east from (37,15) to (38,15) was possible, but then pushing didn't work. Wait, in the history, the agent moved east from (37,15) to (38,15), then tried to move east again (to (39,15)) which failed. So the boulder is at (39,15), and pushing from (38,15) east is blocked.

Therefore, the boulder is at (39,15), and the agent is at (38,15). To push it west to (39,15) (the fountain), but that's where the boulder already is. This is confusing. Maybe the fountain is at a different location.

Alternatively, the agent should look for another boulder to push. But according to the observations, there's a boulder near east and eastnortheast. Maybe there are multiple boulders.

Given the confusion in map parsing, perhaps the safest action is to move the agent towards the boulder and try pushing it in a direction that leads it towards the fountain. Since previous attempts to push east failed, maybe try pushing north or south.

The agent is at (37,15). Let's move east to (38,15) to get next to the boulder at (39,15). Wait, no—the boulder is at (39,15), so the agent needs to be at (38,15) to push it east. But the agent is already at (38,15) after moving east. Trying to push east from there fails because (39,15) is blocked.

In that case, the agent should try pushing the boulder north or south. For example, move to (38,15), then push north to (38,14). If that's possible, then the boulder would be one step north, and perhaps creating a path.

Looking at the map row 7 (y=14) at x=38: it's '{', which is a boulder. So pushing north from (38,15) to (38,14) would require that (38,14) is a floor tile, but there's another boulder there. That's not possible. So pushing north is blocked.

Alternatively, push south. From (38,15) to (38,16). Looking at row 9 (y=16): #<..``{.{#. At x=38 (position 5), it's '{', another boulder. So pushing south is also blocked.

This suggests that the boulder at (39,15) is surrounded by other obstacles, making it impossible to move. Maybe the agent needs to find a different boulder or interact with something else.

Looking back at the inventory, the agent has a long sword and a lance. Maybe attacking something, but the goal is to push boulders onto fountains. So weapon attacks might not be useful here.

Alternatively, the agent could try to move west to (36,15) and look for another way around. But that might not help.

Another idea: The stairs are up near westsouthwest. Maybe the agent should head there to go up a level, but the goal is to push boulders, not climb stairs.

Given the current information, the best possible action is to try pushing the boulder in a different direction. Since east is blocked, try north or south. But both are blocked by other boulders. Alternatively, move the agent to a different position to gain leverage.

The agent is at (37,15). Moving north to (37,14) and then trying to push the boulder from there. From (37,14), the boulder is at (39,15), so the agent would need to move east twice, which is blocked. Not helpful.

Perhaps the agent should move south to (37","

8,Failed to obtain a valid action from the reasoning.,"<reasoning>
The agent is stuck trying to move the boulder to the fountain. Let me look at the map and observations again.

The current position is (37,15). There's a boulder at the adjacent east and northwest. The fountain is nearby to the east. The problem is that when the agent tries to move east, it can't because the boulder is there. The message says ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" So moving directly east isn't working. 

I need to figure out a way to push the boulder. The boulder is adjacent to the agent's current position. To push it east, the agent needs to be diagonally north or south of the boulder so that pushing it east doesn't hit another obstacle. Let's check the map. 

Looking at the map line 8 (assuming y=15 is line 8?), the agent's position is marked with <@... Maybe the boulder is at (38,15) to the east. Since the agent is at (37,15), moving east gets them next to the boulder. But to push the boulder east, they need to be next to it and then move in the direction they want to push. Wait, in Sokoban-like games, you push by moving into the boulder from the side. So if the boulder is at (38,15), the agent at (37,15) can try to move east (but that's against the boulder), so instead, maybe move south to (37,16) and then try pushing the boulder east? But let's check the map.

The map shows that at position (38,15), there's a boulder. To push it east to the fountain at (39,15), the path must be clear. The fountain is very near eastsoutheast, which might be (39,15). So the boulder is at (38,15), and the agent is at (37,15). To push the boulder east, the agent needs to be next to it and then move in the same direction. So stepping east into the boulder's space isn't enough; they have to be adjacent and then move in the direction they want to push. 

Wait, in the game, when you're next to a boulder and move in the direction of the boulder, you push it. So if the agent is at (37,15) and the boulder is at (38,15), moving east would try to move into the boulder's space, which is blocked unless there's space behind the boulder. Let's check the map again. The fountain is at eastsoutheast, which would be (39,15). Is there a clear path there? The bars and dark areas might block that. The language observation mentions a fountain very near east, which could be (38,15) or (39,15). Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to position themselves to the north or south of the boulder so they can push it east. For example, if the agent moves north to (37,14), then moves east into the boulder's space, pushing it to (38,14). But then the fountain is at east, which might be (38,15). Wait, maybe the fountain is at (38,15), so pushing the boulder there would solve the problem. 

But the current map shows that at (38,15) there's a boulder. So the agent is at (37,15), boulder at (38,15). To push the boulder east to (39,15), the agent needs to move east into the boulder, which requires that (39,15) is not blocked. Checking the map, there's a fountain very near east, which is probably (38,15) or (39,15). The language observation says ""fountain very near east"", so maybe (38,15) is the fountain. But the boulder is there, so that can't be. Then maybe the fountain is at (39,15). 

If the agent moves north to (37,14), then moves east into the boulder at (38,15), pushing it to (39,15), which is the fountain. But is (39,15) clear? The map might show a fountain there. The problem is that the agent's previous attempts to move east resulted in trying to move the boulder but failing. Maybe the path behind the boulder is blocked by bars or other obstacles. 

Looking at the language observations, there are bars very near north, northnortheast, etc. The bars could be walls or other solid objects. If the boulder is at (38,15), pushing it east to (39,15) is only possible if that space is empty and not blocked by bars. The observation mentions a fountain very near eastsoutheast, which might be (39,15). So perhaps the agent needs to move to the position where they can push the boulder east into the fountain. 

Another approach: the agent tried moving east, which is against the boulder. So instead, move south to (37,16), then try moving east again. But the map shows that at (37,16) there's a # symbol, which might be a wall or barrier. Alternatively, move north to (37,14) and see if that's possible. The previous action was north, which resulted in the message ""You cannot pass through the bars."" So the north direction is blocked by bars. 

So north is blocked. What about south? The agent is at (37,15). Moving south to (37,16) might be possible if there's no barrier. The map shows a # at (37,16) in the 8th line (assuming line numbers start from 0 or 1). If that's a wall, then moving south is blocked. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent should try moving west to (36,15) and then position themselves to push the boulder east. But the boulder is at (38,15). If the agent goes west, they might be further away. 

Wait, the cursor position after the last move was (38,15), but after moving west, it's back at (37,15). The boulder is adjacent east and northwest. So the boulder is at (38,15) and (37,14) maybe? Or (37,16)? Let me parse the language observations again. 

The language observation says ""boulder adjacent east and northwest"" from the agent's position (37,15). Adjacent east would be (38,15), and adjacent northwest would be (36,14). So the boulder is at (38,15) and (36,14). The fountain is very near east, which is (38,15), but there's a boulder there. So the goal is to push the boulder from (38,15) to (39,15), which is the fountain. 

To push the boulder from (38,15) to (39,15), the agent needs to be at (38,15) and move east. But the agent is at (37,15). So the agent needs to move next to the boulder. The boulder is at (38,15), so the agent needs to go east to (38,15), but that's occupied by the boulder. Instead, the agent should move north or south to get next to the boulder. 

If the agent moves north to (37,14), then they can move east into the boulder at (38,14), pushing it to (39,14). But then the fountain is at (39,15), so that's not the target. Alternatively, moving south to (37,16) and then east into the boulder at (38,15). But (37,16) might be blocked by a #. 

Looking at the map line for y=16: the 9th line (assuming the first line is y=1) shows #<..``{.{#. So at (37,16), there's a `<` character, which is the agent's previous position? Or maybe it's a wall. If moving south to (37,16) is possible, then the agent can move there and then try to push the boulder. 

Alternatively, the agent could try moving to the northwest of the boulder. The boulder is at (38,15) and (36,14). So if the agent moves northwest to (36,14), they can push the boulder there, but that's not towards the fountain. 

Another possibility: the agent needs to move around the boulder to get a position where they can push it east. Since the boulder is at (38,15), the agent could try moving northeast to (39,14), but that might be blocked by bars. 

Given the previous attempts to move east resulted in failure, the agent probably needs to reposition. Let's check the map again. The agent is at (37,15). The boulder is at (38,15). To push it east, the agent must be adjacent and move in the same direction. So moving east into the boulder's space, but that requires that the space behind the boulder (east of it) is clear. 

The language observation mentions a fountain very near eastsoutheast, which could be (39,15). If that's clear, then pushing the boulder there is possible. But if there are bars or other obstacles east of the boulder, it won't work. 

The agent's last action was north, which resulted in ""You cannot pass through the bars."" So north is blocked. What about moving south? If the agent moves south to (37,16), the map shows a `<` there, which might be part of the agent's previous position or a wall. If it's a wall, then moving south is blocked. 

Alternatively, the agent could try moving west to (36,15) and then see if they can approach the boulder from another angle. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent should look for the stairs up, which are very near westsouthwest. The stairs are at (34,14) perhaps, but moving towards them might not help with pushing the boulder. 

The main goal is to push the boulder onto the fountain. The current position of the boulder is at (38,15), and the fountain is at (39,15). So the agent needs to get to (38,15) and push east. But the agent is at (37,15). To get to (38,15), they need to move east, but that's occupied by the boulder. So instead, move north or south to get next to the boulder. 

If the agent moves north to (37,14), then they can move east into the boulder at (38,14), pushing it to (39,14). But that's not the fountain. The fountain is at (39,15). So this might not help. 

Alternatively, move south to (37,16), then east into the boulder at (38,15), pushing it to (39,15). But if (37,16) is blocked, this isn't possible. 

Looking at the map line for y=16: "" #<..``{.{# "" which might indicate that (37,16) is a `<` character, which could be part of the agent's previous position or an obstacle. If moving south is blocked, then the agent can't go that way. 

Another approach: check if there's a clear path east of the boulder. The language observation says ""boulder very near east"" and ""fountain very near east"". So the boulder is blocking the path to the fountain. The agent needs to push the boulder out of the way. 

Since moving east directly isn't working, the agent must find a way to position themselves to push the boulder. Maybe move northwest to (36,14), which is where another boulder is adjacent. But that might not help. 

Alternatively, move southeast to (38,16) if possible, but that area might be blocked. 

Given the constraints, the agent's best bet is to try moving east again, but that's not working. Perhaps there's a different approach. Wait, the agent has a lance. Maybe using a projectile attack could damage the boulder, but in Boxoban, you usually can't attack. The goal is to push, not to destroy. 

Another thought: maybe the boulder is stuck because the path behind it is blocked. The agent needs to clear that path. If the boulder is at (38,15), pushing it east requires that (39,15) is clear. The language observation mentions a fountain very near eastsoutheast, which is likely (39,15). If that's clear, then pushing is possible. 

Assuming (39,15) is clear, the agent needs to get next to the boulder. The agent is at (37,15). To get to (38,15), move east, but it's blocked by the boulder. So instead, move north or south. If north is blocked by bars, try south. If south is blocked, then find another way. 

Alternatively, move west to (36,15) and then try to approach the boulder from the northwest or southeast. 

But given the previous attempts, the agent is stuck. The only valid move that doesn't hit a boulder or bar is to move south if possible. However, moving south resulted in ""You cannot pass through the bars"" before. Wait, the last action was north, which hit bars. The current position is (37,15). Moving south to (37,16) — check the map. The 9th line (y=16) is ""#<..``{.{#"". The agent's cursor is at (37,16), which is the `<` character. So moving south from (37,15) to (37,16) would be into a `<`, which might be part of the agent's own representation or an obstacle. If that's a wall, then the agent can't move south. 

Given all this, the only possible move that doesn't result in an error is to move east again, but that's blocked. Alternatively, move west to (36,15), which might be clear. Let's check the map. The 8th line (y=15) is ""#.`.@{.`.#"". So at (37,15), the agent is at `<@...`. Moving west to (36,15) would be the '.' character, which is a floor. So that's possible. 

So the agent could move west to (36,15), then try to approach the boulder from the northwest or southeast. 

Alternatively, move north again, but that's blocked. 

After moving west to (36,15), the boulder is at (38,15) and (36,14). From (36,15), the agent can move east towards (37,15), but that's their previous position. Not helpful. 

Another option: move northeast to (37,14), which is a floor ('.'), then move east into the boulder at (38,14), pushing it to (39,14). But again, not towards the fountain. 

This is tricky. The agent needs to push the boulder east into the fountain. The only way is to get next to the boulder and push. Since the agent is at (37,15), the boulder is at (38,15). To push east, the agent needs to be at (38,15) and move east. But that's occupied by the boulder. So the agent must move to (38,15) by moving east, but that's blocked. Therefore, the agent needs to find a way around. 

Wait, perhaps the boulder is at (38,15) and the agent is at (37,15). To push the boulder east, the agent can move east into it, but only if the space behind the boulder (east of it) is clear. The agent's message when trying to move east says ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" This implies that the space behind the boulder is blocked. So the boulder can't be moved east because the target space is occupied. 

Therefore, the agent needs to move the boulder to a different position where it can be pushed towards the fountain. For example, push it north or south first. 

If the agent moves north to (37,14), then moves east into the boulder at (38,14), pushing it to (39,14). Then, from (39,14), push east to (40,14), but that's not the fountain. Alternatively, from (39,14), move south to (39,15), which is the fountain. But that requires the boulder to be at (39,14) and then the agent can move into it to push further. 

But this is getting complicated. Maybe the agent should first push the boulder north or south to create a path. 

Looking at the map, the agent is at (37,15). Moving north to (37,14) is possible if that's a floor. The 8th line (y=14) is ""##{####..#"". So at (37,14), the character is '{', which might be a door or a different obstacle. If it's a door, the agent might need a key. But the agent has a key (the +0 helmet is a helmet, not a key). So moving north might be blocked by a door. 

Alternatively, the agent could move south to (37,16), but that's the '<' character, which might be part of the agent's own map display. 

This is quite challenging. Given the previous actions and the current situation, the best bet might be to keep trying to move east and see if there's a different outcome, but the message says it's in vain. 

Wait, another idea: the boulder might be immovable because it's blocked. The agent needs to find a way to unblock it. Maybe there's a way to remove the obstacle behind the boulder. 

Looking at the language observations, there are bars very near north, which could be walls. If the boulder is blocked by bars, then it can't be moved. But the agent's goal is to push it onto the fountain, which is east. 

Alternatively, the fountain is not directly east of the boulder but eastsoutheast. So the boulder needs to be moved east and south. 

This is getting too complicated. Given the time constraints, perhaps the best action is to keep moving east and see if the agent can find a way to push the boulder, or perhaps move in a different direction to reposition. 

But the agent's previous attempts to move east didn't work. Maybe trying to move northeast or southeast? 

Wait, the boulder is adjacent east and northwest. So from the agent's position (37,15), the boulder is at (38,15) (east) and (36,14) (northwest). If the agent moves northwest to (36,14), which is where the other boulder is, they might be able to push that one, but it's not towards the fountain. 

Alternatively, move southeast to (38,16) if possible, but that area might be blocked. 

Given all this, the most logical action is","

The agent is stuck trying to move north again because there are bars blocking the way. Let's see the current situation. The knight is at position (37, 15). The map shows that moving north leads to bars. The previous attempts to go east kept hitting boulders or walls.

Looking at the map:

The agent is near a boulder that's adjacent to the southeast and south. The fountain is to the eastsoutheast, but there's a boulder in the way. The goal is to push the boulder onto the fountain. The agent tried moving east multiple times but ended up hitting the boulder. Then when moving north, the bars are unmovable obstacles.

So, the plan should be to position the knight to push the boulder. Since the boulder is to the southeast, maybe moving the knight to the west or southwest could allow pushing it towards the fountain. But the agent is currently at (37,15). Let's check the adjacent tiles.

The boulder is adjacent southeast and south. So, if the knight moves south, they might be able to push the boulder. Wait, but earlier attempts to move south resulted in a message saying they couldn't move the boulder. Wait, no, the last move was west, and then south again. Let me check the messages.

In the last observations, when the agent tried moving east, they hit the boulder. When moving north, they hit bars. When moving south, the message was ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" So trying to move south again might not work. Maybe the boulder is stuck against something else.

Looking at the map, the boulder is at a position that's adjacent southeast and south. The fountain is eastsoutheast, but maybe there's a path to the east where the boulder can be pushed. The agent is at (37,15). If they move east to (38,15), they hit the boulder. Then moving south from there is blocked by the boulder. Alternatively, moving west to (36,15) might give a better positioning.

Wait, the agent was at (37,15) after moving west. So maybe moving west again to (36,15) and then try to approach the boulder from the west? But the boulder is adjacent southeast and south. So from (37,15), moving west to (36,15), then perhaps moving south to (36,16)? But the map shows that at (36,16), there's a floor (since the agent's position is (37,16) initially, but after moving east, they were at (38,16). Wait, maybe the map's exact layout is a bit unclear.

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to find a way to get around the bars to the north. But since moving north is blocked by bars, perhaps the best option is to try to navigate around the boulder. Since the boulder is at (38,15) or similar, pushing it south towards the fountain. But the agent tried moving south and it didn't work. Maybe the boulder is stuck against another obstacle.

Another approach: check the inventory. The knight has a sword and a lance, but pushing boulders is done by moving into them when there's space behind. The agent needs to get behind the boulder to push it. If the boulder is at (38,15), which is east of the agent's current position (37,15), then the agent could move east to (38,15), but that's where the boulder is. So instead, the agent should move around to the south or west of the boulder.

Wait, the boulder is adjacent southeast and south. So from the agent's position (37,15), moving east to (38,15) is the boulder. Moving south from (37,15) would take them to (37,16), which might be a floor. If that's the case, maybe the agent can move south, then east to get around the boulder.

Let me check the map again. The agent's current position is (37,15). The map line for y=15 is:

#.`@.{.`.#  where the `<` is at (37,15). So the agent is on a floor tile. To the east (38,15) is `{` which is a boulder. Moving south to (37,16) is `.` which is a floor. So moving south is possible.

So the plan could be: move south to (37,16), then east to (38,16), which might be a floor, then push the boulder south or east. Wait, but the boulder is at (38,15). If the agent moves east to (38,16), then they can try to move the boulder from there by pushing it south into the fountain.

Alternatively, move south to (37,16), then east to (38,16), then try pushing the boulder south into the fountain at (east southeast). Let's see the fountain positions. The language observation mentions fountain very near east and eastsoutheast. So maybe the fountain is at (39,15) or (39,16).

If the agent can push the boulder from the east direction (38,15) towards south or southeast, that could work. So the steps would be: move south to (37,16), then east to (38,16), then try to move south into the boulder, pushing it to (38,16) -> (38,15) is the boulder, so pushing it south would take it to (38,16), but that's where the agent is. Hmm, that might not work.

Alternatively, from (38,16), move south to (38,17), then push the boulder south into the fountain. But first, need to get the agent to that position. Let's outline the possible path:

Current position: (37,15)

1. Move south to (37,16)
2. Move east to (38,16)
3. Move south to (38,17)
4. Push the boulder (which is at (38,15)) south into (38,16), but that's occupied by the agent. So maybe the agent needs to be behind the boulder. Alternatively, push the boulder east into the fountain.

Wait, the boulder is at (38,15). If the agent can move to (38,14), then push the boulder east into (38,15), but that's where the boulder already is. Not helpful. Alternatively, push the boulder east towards the fountain.

The fountain is to the eastsoutheast, so perhaps at (39,16) or similar. So if the agent can push the boulder from (38,15) east to (39,15), then that's onto the fountain.

To do that, the agent needs to be to the west of the boulder and push it east. The agent is currently at (37,15). So moving east twice to (39,15) would reach the boulder's position, but that's not possible because there's a boulder at (38,15). So the agent needs to get to the west side of the boulder.

But the boulder is at (38,15), adjacent to the agent's current position. So the agent is at (37,15), east is the boulder. To get behind the boulder, the agent would need to move south or north around it. Since moving north is blocked by bars, moving south to (37,16), then east to (38,16), then south to (38,17), then west to (37,17), positioning to the west of the boulder. Then push the boulder east.

But this is getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the agent should try to move the boulder by approaching it from the south. From (37,15), move south to (37,16), then east to (38,16), then try to push the boulder south into (38,16) which is a floor. But that would just move the boulder into the agent's position, which isn't helpful.

Wait, maybe the correct approach is to move the agent to the west of the boulder. To do that, the agent can move west to (36,15), then south to (36,16), then east to (37,16), then east to (38,16), and then try to push the boulder south. But the boulder is at (38,15), so pushing it south would take it to (38,16), which is where the agent is. That won't work.

Alternatively, move the agent to (38,14), then push the boulder east. But how to get there? The agent is at (37,15). Move east to (38,15) (the boulder), can't. So need to go around. Move south to (37,16), east to (38,16), south to (38,17), then west to (37,17), then north to (37,16), then east to (38,16), then north to (38,15) (boulder), then try to push east. But this is getting too convoluted.

Alternatively, look for another boulder. The language observation mentions a boulder very near east, which might be the same one. The agent's goal is to push this boulder onto the fountain. Since pushing isn't working when trying to move east, perhaps the agent needs to find a different path. Maybe there's a way to the north around the bars, but they are solid.

Another angle: check the stairs up. They are very near westsouthwest, which might be at (36,14) or similar. Maybe going upstairs isn't helpful here since it's level 1.

Wait, the inventory has a lot of apples and carrots, but those aren't useful for pushing boulders. The agent needs to physically move the boulder by walking into it from the correct direction.

Given that the agent is at (37,15), and the boulder is at (38,15), perhaps the correct action is to move south to (37,16), then east to (38,16), then move south to (38,17), then try to push the boulder south into (38,16). But that might not work. Alternatively, from (38,16), push the boulder east into (39,16), which is the fountain.

But to push the boulder east, the agent needs to be to the west of it. The agent is at (38,16), which is east of the boulder's current position (38,15). So the agent is adjacent to the boulder's east side. In that case, pushing the boulder east would take it to (39,15), which may be a fountain.

So the steps would be:

1. From (37,15), move south to (37,16).
2. Move east to (38,16).
3. Move south to (38,17).
4. Move west to (37,17).
5. Move north to (37,16).
6. Move east to (38,16).
7. Now, try to push the boulder east (action: east).

But this is a lot of moves. However, given the agent's previous attempts, perhaps the immediate next step is to try pushing the boulder east from (38,16).

But how to get to (38,16) without being blocked. Let's see:

Current position: (37,15). Move south to (37,16) (valid, floor). Then east to (38,16) (floor). Now at (38,16). The boulder is at (38,15), so to the south. Now, if the agent tries to move east from (38,16), they would be pushing the boulder at (38,15) east into (39,15). If (39,15) is a fountain, that's the solution.

So the next action should be east, attempting to push the boulder.

",-0.001,False
10,south,"<reasoning>
Let's see where I am. The agent is in a Boxoban-like environment, trying to push boulders onto fountains. The goal is to move the boulder to the fountain.

Looking at the current observation, the agent is at position (38,15). The map shows some bars, dark areas, and a boulder near east. There's a fountain very near eastsoutheast and westnorthwest. Also, stairs up are near westsouthwest. 

The recent actions were trying to move east multiple times, but when the agent tried to move the boulder east, it failed. The message ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" suggests that the agent is adjacent to the boulder but can't push it because there's something blocking the path behind it. 

From the map, the agent's current position is near the boulder. To push the boulder east, the agent needs to be positioned so that pushing it east doesn't hit a wall or an obstacle. The adjacent squares for the boulder are east and southeast. Since the last attempt to push east failed, maybe the path is blocked. 

Looking at the language observations, there's a boulder adjacent east and northwest. The agent is trying to move east, but the boulder is there, and pushing it requires the space behind it to be clear. 

So, perhaps the agent needs to move around the boulder. Since the boulder is to the east, maybe moving south or north to get around it. Alternatively, check if there's a clear path to the fountain. The fountain is near eastsoutheast, so moving the boulder in that direction would require pushing it southeast. 

But the agent's last position was (38,15) after moving east. The boulder is adjacent east, so it's at (39,15). To push it east to (40,15), there needs to be space there. The map shows eastsoutheast as a fountain, so maybe (40,15) is a fountain. But the agent needs to confirm if that's the case. 

Alternatively, maybe moving the agent north or south to get a better angle. The current position is y=15. If the agent moves north to y=14, perhaps they can position themselves to push the boulder east directly. 

Wait, the agent is at (38,15). If they move north to (38,14), then they can try pushing the boulder east again from that position. But need to check if there's a wall or obstacle in the way. The map shows ""bars adjacent north, northeast, and northwest"" near the agent's current position. So moving north might lead into a bar, which is a wall. 

So moving north is not possible. How about moving south to y=16? The agent was originally at y=16 before moving north. But moving south from (38,15) to (38,16) might be possible. Let's check the map again. The map shows some structures, but exact layout isn't clear. 

Alternatively, the agent could try pushing the boulder in another direction. Since the boulder is at (39,15), pushing it southeast to (40,16) could reach the fountain at eastsoutheast. But the agent would need to position themselves south of the boulder. 

The agent is currently at (38,15). If they move south to (38,16), then they are south of the boulder at (39,15). Then they could try pushing the boulder southeast. But need to check if that path is clear. 

Alternatively, moving west to (37,15) and then pushing the boulder east. But the agent tried moving west before and the boulder is adjacent east. 

Hmm. The key issue is that the agent is next to the boulder but can't push it because the path is blocked. The previous attempts to push east failed because the behind position is blocked. So the agent needs to find a way around the boulder. 

Looking at the language observations, there's a fountain very near eastsoutheast. The boulder is near east, so pushing it towards the fountain would be the goal. Maybe the boulder needs to be moved east to (39,15) to (40,15), which is the fountain. But the agent is at (38,15), so pushing the boulder east from there would require the space at (39,15) to be clear. However, the boulder is already at (39,15), so the agent is next to it. Wait, no—the boulder is adjacent east, meaning it's at (39,15). So the agent is at (38,15), next to the boulder. To push it east, the agent needs to be facing the boulder and the space behind it must be clear. 

The problem is that when the agent tried to push east, it failed. That suggests that the space east of the boulder (40,15) is blocked. Maybe there's a wall or another obstacle there. 

Looking at the map, there's a structure with ##...####### etc. It's possible that pushing the boulder east would hit a wall. So the agent can't push it that way. 

In that case, the agent needs to find another way to move the boulder. Perhaps moving it north or south. But the boulder's adjacent squares are east and northwest. The agent is at (38,15), so the boulder is at (39,15). The adjacent squares for the boulder are east (40,15), northwest (38,14), and southeast (40,16). 

If the agent wants to push the boulder northwest, they need to move to (38,14) and then push northwest. But the agent tried moving north before and hit bars. The language observation says ""bars adjacent north, northeast, and northwest"" near the agent's position. So moving north from (38,15) is blocked by bars. 

Moving northwest from the agent's position would be to (37,14), but the boulder is at (39,15). So pushing the boulder northwest would require the agent to be at (38,14) and then push it to (37,14). But is that path clear? 

The language observation mentions dark areas and stairs, but no specific obstacles in that direction. The agent might have to navigate around the bars and dark areas to position themselves to push the boulder in a different direction. 

Alternatively, the agent could move south to (38,16) and then try pushing the boulder east or southeast. But the map's structure isn't clear, so it's risky. 

The key is to find a clear path to push the boulder towards the fountain. Since the fountain is eastsoutheast, pushing the boulder southeast might be the way. To do that, the agent needs to be south of the boulder. 

So the steps would be: 
1. Move south from (38,15) to (38,16).
2. Then move east to (39,16), positioning south of the boulder at (39,15).
3. Push the boulder southeast to (40,16), which is the fountain.

But need to check if moving south is possible. The agent's current position is at (38,15). The map shows ""bars adjacent north, northeast, and northwest"", but south is not mentioned. So moving south might be possible. 

If the agent moves south to (38,16), then they can check the surroundings. The language observation says ""fountain very near east"", so moving east from there might lead to the fountain. 

Alternatively, the agent could try moving west to (37,15) and then pushing the boulder east, but that might not clear the path. 

Considering all this, the best action might be to move south to position themselves better, then attempt to push the boulder in a direction that leads it to the fountain. 

Another possibility is to check if the fountain is at (40,15) or (40,16). Since the fountain is very near eastsoutheast, which could be (39,16) or similar. 

But without a clear map, it's challenging. The agent needs to navigate around obstacles and find a way to push the boulder towards the fountain. 

Given the previous failures to push east, the agent should try a different direction. Moving south and then attempting to push the boulder southeast might work. 

So the next action could be to move south. Alternatively, move west to get around the boulder and then push east. 

But the agent already tried moving west and is back at (37,15). Maybe moving north isn't possible due to bars. 

In summary, the agent needs to find a clear path to push the boulder towards the fountain. The most promising direction might be southeast, so moving south first to position correctly.

Let me try to figure out what the agent needs to do here. The agent is in a Boxoban-like environment, and the goal is to push boulders onto fountains. The previous actions were moving east multiple times, but there's a boulder that's blocking the way. When the agent tried to push it, it failed. Now, looking at the current observation, the agent is at (38, 15) facing a boulder adjacent to the east and southeast. The fountains are nearby to the east. The agent needs to find a way to move that boulder onto the fountain.

First, the agent tried pushing east but couldn't because there's a boulder in the way. The next step might be to move around the boulder. Since the boulder is to the east, maybe moving south or north could allow the agent to get around it. Let me check the map again. The map shows that the agent is near a spot with a boulder adjacent southeast and south. The fountain is very near eastsoutheast. So, maybe if the agent moves south, they can get next to the boulder and then push it east towards the fountain.

But before moving south, I should check if there are any obstacles. The language observation mentions bars from the north, northnortheast, etc., which might be walls or obstacles. The agent tried moving north earlier but encountered bars, so maybe that's a wall. The stairs are up to the westsouthwest, but the priority is pushing the boulder.

Looking at the cursor position (38,15), moving south would take the agent to (38,14). The boulder is adjacent southeast and south, so moving south might place the agent next to the boulder. Then, pushing the boulder east would move it towards the fountain at eastsoutheast. That seems like a viable plan. Alternatively, moving west to get behind the boulder, but the boulder is also adjacent southeast, so maybe moving south first is better.

Another option is to check if the boulder can be pushed south, but the fountain is eastsoutheast, so pushing it east would be more direct. The agent needs to position themselves to push the boulder. If moving south gets them next to the boulder, then pushing east would work. Let's verify if moving south is possible. The language observations don't mention bars in the south direction near the agent's current position, so it's likely free. 

So the plan is: move south to get next to the boulder, then push it east towards the fountain. That should work. Alternatively, if moving south is blocked, then try another direction. But according to the current observations, the agent was able to move south before and the boulder is adjacent southeast, meaning the boulder is one square to the southeast. So moving south would place the agent at (38,14), which is south of their current position. Then, from there, moving east would allow pushing the boulder towards the fountain. 

Therefore, the next action should be south to get into position, then east to push the boulder. But since the agent needs to choose one action now, the immediate action should be south to reposition.

12,Failed to obtain a valid action from the reasoning.,"<reasoning>
Let's see where I am. The agent is trying to push the boulder onto the fountain in Boxoban. The current position is (38,15). The map shows some bars and dark areas around. The boulder is adjacent to the east and southeast, and there's a fountain to the east.

Looking at the previous actions, the agent has been moving east multiple times but kept getting a message that the boulder couldn't be moved. That probably means the boulder is stuck behind something or there's an obstacle behind it. The last few attempts to push it resulted in failure, so maybe the agent needs to try a different approach.

The latest message says ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" So the boulder isn't moving. Maybe the agent needs to check if there's an obstacle behind the boulder. Alternatively, perhaps the boulder is next to the fountain already, but the agent isn't positioning correctly. The language observation mentions a fountain very near eastsoutheast and westnorthwest. The boulder is very near west, so maybe the agent needs to get to the other side of the boulder to push it towards the fountain.

The inventory shows the agent has a long sword and a lance, but that's probably not needed here. The goal is to push the boulder. Since previous attempts to push east didn't work, maybe moving west to get around the boulder? But the boulder is adjacent to the east and southeast. If the agent moves south or north, maybe they can position themselves to push the boulder in a different direction.

Looking at the map, the agent's current position is (38,15). The boulder is at (39,15) perhaps, since it's adjacent east. The fountain is east, maybe at (39,16) or similar. To push the boulder east into the fountain, the agent needs to be west of the boulder and move east into it. But the agent tried that and failed. Maybe there's a barrier behind the boulder. The bars are mentioned in the language observations, so perhaps the boulder is against a wall or bars that prevent it from being moved further east.

In that case, the agent might need to find another way to rearrange the environment. Alternatively, maybe the boulder is already in a position where it's blocked, so the agent needs to move it in a different direction, like south or north, if possible. But the fountain is east, so pushing it north or south might not be the way.

Alternatively, the agent might need to check if there's a way to remove the obstacle behind the boulder. Since the agent has a sword, maybe attacking the bars or obstacles. However, in Boxoban, typically you can only push boulders, not attack. So that might not be possible.

Another possibility is that the agent is not adjacent properly to the boulder. To push a boulder, you need to be next to it and move in the direction you want to push. If the agent is at (38,15) and the boulder is at (39,15), then moving east into the boulder would push it east. But if the agent tried that and it failed, maybe there's something at (40,15) blocking the boulder's path. The language observation mentions bars very near north, northeast, etc., so perhaps there's a bar at (40,15), making it impossible to push the boulder further east.

In that case, the agent can't push the boulder east into the fountain because there's a barrier. Then the options are to try pushing it in another direction, but the fountain is east. Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to move the boulder to a different position to reach the fountain. However, without knowing the full map layout, it's hard to say. The agent's map shows a lot of ######, which might represent walls or barriers.

Given the current state, the agent might need to backtrack. Moving west to get around the boulder and see if there's another way to push it. For example, moving west to (37,15) and then trying to push the boulder north or south. But the boulder is adjacent east and southeast, so if the agent is at (37,15), the boulder would be at (38,15). Then moving north into the boulder might push it to (38,14), but is there a fountain there? The language observation mentions a fountain adjacent east, which is where the boulder is trying to go. So maybe the problem is the barrier behind.

Since the agent can't push the boulder east, perhaps the next best action is to try a different direction. Maybe move north or south to see if there's a path. Alternatively, check if the boulder can be moved south into a position where the fountain is accessible.

Wait, the fountain is very near eastsoutheast. So maybe the boulder needs to be pushed to (39,16) or similar. If the agent is at (38,15) and the boulder is at (39,15), pushing east would take it to (40,15), but there's a bar there. So the agent can't do that. Therefore, the agent needs to find another way to get the boulder to the fountain. Perhaps by moving it north or south around the barrier.

Looking at the cursor position and map, the agent is at (38,15). The map's ninth line (assuming y=15 is the ninth line) shows #<..``{.{#. The '<' is the agent's position. The boulder is adjacent east, so in the next cell to the east. The '{' might represent the boulder. So the cell (39,15) is a boulder. To push it east, the agent needs to be at (38,15) and move east into (39,15), which would push the boulder to (40,15). But the language observation says there are bars very near north, northeast, etc., which might be at (40,15), making it impossible.

Given that, the agent can't push the boulder further east. So the next option is to try to move the boulder in another direction. For example, moving the boulder south into (39,16). But the agent's current position is (38,15). To push the boulder south, the agent would need to be at (39,15) and move south. But the agent is at (38,15), so they need to move east to get next to the boulder. But previous attempts to move east into the boulder failed because the path is blocked. So maybe the agent needs to move south first to get to (38,16), then try to push the boulder east from there.

Wait, the agent is at (38,15). The boulder is at (39,15). If the agent moves south to (38,16), then they can try to push the boulder east from there. But does the map allow that? The map's ninth line shows #<..``{.{#. The '<' is at (38,15), and the next cell is '.', then '``', then '{', which is the boulder at (39,15). So moving south to (38,16) would be into a '.' which is floor. Then from there, moving east into the boulder would try to push it to (40,15), which is blocked by bars. So that still doesn't work.

Alternatively, maybe the agent can move the boulder north. From (38,15), move north to (38,14), then try to push the boulder north into (39,14). But is there a fountain there? The language observation mentions a fountain very near east, which is where the boulder is trying to go. So pushing north might not help.

Hmm. This is tricky. The agent needs to get the boulder onto the fountain, but the path is blocked. Maybe the only way is to find a way to remove the barrier, but in Boxoban, you can't do that. So perhaps the agent has to rearrange the boulder to a position where the path is clear. But without knowing the full map, it's hard to see.

Alternatively, maybe the agent made a mistake in earlier moves and needs to backtrack. For example, moving west to (37,15) and then trying different directions. But the boulder is at (39,15), so moving west wouldn't help. Unless the agent can push the boulder west, but that's not the direction of the fountain.

Wait, the boulder is at (39,15). The fountain is east, so (40,15) maybe. But there's a bar there. So the agent can't push it further east. The only option is to find another path. Maybe the boulder can be pushed south into a different corridor where the fountain is accessible. But the agent needs to see the map.

The map shows a lot of ########## which are probably walls. The agent's current position is near the eastern part of the map. The boulder is adjacent east, and the fountain is very near east. The bars are blocking the path further east. So the agent is stuck. Perhaps the solution is to move the boulder in a different direction, but there's no fountain in other directions according to the language observations.

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to move the boulder onto the fountain that's adjacent east. But if the fountain is at (39,16), and the boulder is at (39,15), pushing it east would require the boulder to move to (40,15), which is blocked. So unless there's a way to move the boulder north or south into the fountain, but the observations don't mention a fountain in those directions.

This is a bit of a dead end. The agent has been trying to push the boulder east but can't due to the barrier. The next logical step might be to try moving in another direction, but without a clear path to the fountain, it's challenging. Maybe the agent should explore other areas of the map to find a way to rearrange the boulder. For example, moving north or south to see if there's a different path.

Looking at the cursor position (38,15), moving north would take the agent to (38,14). The map's eighth line (assuming y=14) is #.`..{.`.#. The agent would move into a '.' which is floor. From there, they could try to push the boulder north from (39,15) to (39,14), but is there a fountain there? The language observation mentions a fountain very near east, so maybe not. This might not be helpful.

Alternatively, moving south to (38,16). The map's tenth line is ##########, which is a wall, so the agent can't move south beyond that. So movement south is blocked.

Given the current options, the agent might need to try a different approach. Since pushing east isn't working, maybe moving west to get around the boulder and see if there's another way to push it. But the boulder is at (39,15), and the agent is at (38,15). Moving west to (37,15) doesn't help with the boulder's position.

Wait, perhaps the agent can push the boulder south into (39,16), which might be a valid position. The agent needs to be at (39,15) to push it south. So the agent should move east to (39,15), but earlier attempts resulted in the message ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" Why is that? Maybe because the agent is not adjacent correctly, or there's an obstacle behind.

Wait, when the agent is at (38,15) and tries to move east into (39,15) (the boulder), it should push the boulder to (40,15). If that's blocked, the message makes sense. So the agent can't move the boulder east because the target cell is blocked. Therefore, the agent needs to find a way to move the boulder in a direction where the path is clear.

Since the fountain is east, but the path is blocked, maybe the agent needs to move the boulder to a different part of the map where the path to the fountain is clear. However, without knowing the full map layout, it's hard to plan. 

Another possibility is that the agent has to interact with the stairs up, but the goal is to push the boulder onto the fountain, so that's probably not relevant right now.

Given the current information, the best action might be to continue trying to push the boulder in different directions, but considering the obstacles. Since east is blocked, maybe trying to push the boulder north or south. For example, moving the agent to (39,15) by moving east, then pushing north into (39,14). But how to get to (39,15)?

The agent is at (38,15). Moving east to (39,15) would require pushing the boulder, but the agent can't move into a boulder unless they are pushing it. Wait, no. The agent can move into a boulder if they are pushing it. So if the agent is at (38,15) and moves east, they would push the boulder from (39,15) to (40,15). But since that's blocked, it fails.

So the agent can't move east into the boulder. Therefore, the agent must find another way. Maybe moving the boulder west into (38,15), but the agent is already there. That doesn't help.

Alternatively, the agent could move north or south around the boulder. For example, moving north to (38,14), then trying to push the boulder north from (39,15) to (39,14). If that's possible, then maybe from there, push east into the fountain. But the agent would need to be at (39,15) to push north. So the agent needs to move east first, which they can't do because it's blocked.

This is quite challenging. Given the available actions and the current state, the agent might have to explore other directions to find a way to rearrange the boulder. Since moving east isn't working, perhaps moving south is not possible (due to the wall), moving north is possible but might not lead anywhere. Moving west doesn't help with the boulder's position.

Another angle: perhaps the agent needs to check if the boulder is already on the fountain. The language observation mentions a fountain very near east, and the boulder is very near west. So maybe the boulder isn't on the fountain yet. The agent needs to get it there.

Given that, and the barrier blocking the east path, the only option is to find a way around. But without knowing the map's full layout, it's hard to say. The agent might need to move the boulder in a different direction, like south, and see if that leads to a position where the fountain is accessible.

Wait, the language observation says there's a fountain very near eastsoutheast. So maybe the boulder needs to be pushed to the southeast. If the agent can push the boulder south into (39,16), then east into (40,16), which might be the fountain. But the agent can't move east from (39,15) because of the bar at (40,15). So pushing south first might not help.

Alternatively, pushing the boulder north into (39,14), then east into (40,14). But again, not sure if that's the fountain.

This is quite a puzzle. Given the information, the safest bet might be to continue trying to push the boulder in different directions, but since east is blocked, maybe trying south or north. However, based on the map, moving south is blocked by a wall. Moving north might allow pushing the boulder north, but not towards the fountain.

In the absence of a clear path, perhaps the agent should try to explore other areas of the map to find a way to rearrange the boulder. For instance, moving west to (37,15) and then trying to push the boulder from there. But the boulder is at (39,15), so moving west doesn't help.

Alternatively, the agent could move north to (38,14) and then try to push the boulder north from (39,15) to (39,14). If that's possible, then from there, maybe push east. But again, the path to the east from (40,14) is unclear.

Given the time I've spent on this, I think the best action the agent can take right now, given the previous attempts and the barriers, is to try moving south. Wait, but the map shows a wall at (38,16). So moving south is not possible. Therefore, the agent has no valid moves except maybe west or north, but north might not help.

Wait, the agent is at (38,15). The map's ninth line is #<..``{.{#. So moving north to (38,14) is into a '.', which is floor. From there, the agent could try to push the boulder north from (39,15) to (39,14). To do that, the agent would need to be at (39,15), which requires moving east first, but that's blocked.

This is really stuck. Maybe the agent needs to move the boulder west into (38,15), but the agent is already there. That doesn't make sense.

Another possibility: perhaps the boulder is already on the fountain. The language observation says ""fountain very near east"" and ""boulder very near west"". If the boulder is adjacent to the fountain, maybe it's already in place. But the message about trying to move it suggests it's not on the fountain yet.

In Boxoban, the goal is to have all boulders on fountains. So if the boulder is adjacent to the fountain but not on it, the agent needs to push it exactly onto the fountain cell. If the fountain is at (40,15), and the boulder is at (39,15), pushing east would place it on (40,15), but there's a bar there. So that's impossible.

Given all this, the agent might be in a loop trying to push the boulder east, which is impossible. The correct action here would be to try a different direction, but without a clear path, the agent might have to explore other areas. However, based on the current observations, the only possible moves are north, south, east, or west, but south is blocked by a wall, east is pushing into a blocked cell, west doesn't help, and north might be an option.

So perhaps the agent should move north to (38,14) and then try to find a way to push the boulder from there. But how?

From (38,14), the agent could try to move east into the boulder at (39,15), which would push it to (40,15), but that's blocked. So no.

Alternatively, from (38,14), the agent could move north to (38,13), but the map's seventh line is ##{####..#, which at x=38 would be a '#', so that's a wall. So moving north beyond (38,14) is blocked.

This is really frustrating. The agent is stuck because the boulder can't be moved further east due to a barrier, and other directions don","

",-0.001,False

Let's see. I need to figure out where the boulders and fountains are to push them into place. The agent is trying to move east a few times but kept hitting bars, so that's a wall. The latest observation shows the agent is at (38,15) facing east, where there's a boulder adjacent. But when they tried moving east, it didn't work, probably because the boulder is in the way.

Looking at the map, the agent is near a fountain to the east. The goal is to push the boulder onto the fountain. The problem is the boulder is stuck where it is. The agent needs to check if there's a path behind the boulder to push it. But according to the language observations, the boulder is adjacent to the east and northwest. So maybe the boulder is against a wall or another obstacle, making it impossible to push further east.

The agent tried moving north earlier but hit bars again. Maybe moving west could let them circle around the boulder. Alternatively, since the boulder is adjacent to the east, pushing it north or south might work if there's space. But the current position is (38,15), and the boulder is adjacent east. If the agent moves west to (37,15), they might be able to approach the boulder from another angle. Then, perhaps push it south or north if there's space.

Looking at the map symbols, there's a `<` at (38,16) which might be the agent's previous position. The current position is (38,15). The boulder is adjacent east, so at (39,15). The fountain is very near eastsoutheast, which might be at (40,16) or similar. To push the boulder towards the fountain, the agent needs to find a path where they can push it east into the fountain. But since moving east directly isn't working, maybe moving south or north first to create a path.

Alternatively, check if the boulder can be pushed west. If the agent is at (38,15) and the boulder is at (39,15), pushing west would move it to (38,15), but the agent is already there. So that's not possible. Maybe the boulder is blocked by something else to the east. In that case, the agent needs to find another way to navigate around it.

Another approach: Since the agent has a sword and lance, maybe attacking something, but the main goal is to push the boulder. The stairs are up to the westsouthwest, but maybe not needed yet. The priority is to get the boulder to the fountain. Let's check the language observations again. The fountain is very near east, so perhaps at (39,16). The boulder is very near west, so at (37,15). If the agent can move west to (37,15), then they can try pushing the boulder east towards the fountain. But the agent is already at (38,15), and moving west takes them to (37,15), where there's a boulder adjacent southeast and west. Wait, the boulder adjacent southeast and west at (37,15) would mean the boulder is at (37,14) or (38,14). Hmm, not sure. The language observations say ""boulder adjacent southeast and west"" at the agent's current position (37,15). So the boulders are to the southeast (maybe (38,16)) and west (maybe (36,15)). 

This is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to visualize the area around the agent. The agent is at (38,15). To the east is a boulder at (39,15). The fountain is to the eastsoutheast, say (40,16). To push the boulder east into the fountain, the agent needs to be next to it and push. But when the agent tries to move east, it's blocked by the boulder. So the agent should position themselves to the north or south of the boulder to push it. For example, if the agent moves north to (38,14), then they can push the boulder east to (39,14), but that's not towards the fountain. Alternatively, move south to (38,16) and then push east towards (39,16), which is near the fountain. 

Wait, the map shows a `<` at (38,16), which is the agent's previous position. Currently, the agent is at (38,15). The boulder is at (39,15). If the agent moves south to (38,16), then they can try pushing the boulder east into (39,16), which is towards the fountain. Let's check if that's possible. The language observation says there's a fountain very near eastnortheast, which might be (39,16). So pushing the boulder there would solve the problem. 

But the agent needs to get around the boulder. Since moving east directly is blocked, moving south to (38,16) might allow them to then push east. Let's see if the path is clear. From (38,16), moving east would go to (39,16), which is the direction of the fountain. If there's no obstacle there, the agent can push the boulder. The language observation mentions a fountain very near eastnortheast and northnorthwest. So (39,16) is likely a fountain. 

Therefore, the next step is to move south to (38,16) and then push the boulder east. But wait, the agent's current position is (38,15), and moving south would take them to (38,16). The map shows a `<` there, which might be the agent's previous position. Let me confirm the map layout. The agent's current position is (38,15), and the map shows a `#<..``{.{#` on row 9. So row 9, column 38 is `<`, which is the agent's position. Moving south from (38,15) would go to (38,16), which is part of the `#` symbols, but perhaps that's a walkable path. 

Assuming that moving south is possible, the agent can then attempt to push the boulder east. So the sequence would be: move south to (38,16), then push the boulder east to (39,16), which is the fountain. This should solve the puzzle. 

Therefore, the chosen action is to move south.

Let's see. I need to figure out the next move for the agent in this Boxoban-like game. The goal is to push the boulder onto the fountain. The agent is a knight at position (38, 15) looking east, and there's a boulder adjacent to the east and northwest. The fountain is near the east, but the boulder is blocking the way.

Looking at the map, the agent is facing east, and the boulder is right there. The problem is that every time the agent tries to move east or push the boulder east, the response is ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" That probably means there's an obstacle behind the boulder. The action ""east"" just moves the agent without pushing, which doesn't help. 

The message says the boulder can't be moved, so maybe there's something behind it. The agent needs to check if there's a way around the boulder. Since the boulder is adjacent to the east, maybe moving south or north could allow the agent to position themselves to push the boulder in a different direction. 

Looking at the cursor position (38,15), moving south would take the agent to (38,16). Let me check if there's anything there. The map shows that at position (38,16), there's a boulder adjacent northeast and east. Wait, maybe moving south would allow the agent to get around the boulder to the south and then push it east towards the fountain. 

Alternatively, moving west might bring the agent back to where they were before, but the boulder there is very near west. Maybe pushing that boulder first? But the immediate goal is the east boulder. Let me think. 

If the agent moves south once, they can then try pushing the eastern boulder south. But does the map show any obstacles there? The language observation mentions dark areas and bars in various directions, but not necessarily solid blocks. The key is that the boulder can only be moved if there's space behind it. Since pushing east isn't working, maybe moving south and then trying to push the boulder south towards the fountain would work. 

Alternatively, moving north might not help because there are bars there. The agent previously tried north and got a ""You cannot pass through the bars."" So north is blocked. 

So the best bet might be to move south to (38,16), then attempt to push the boulder east again. If that still doesn't work, maybe there's another path. Let me verify. 

The current position is (38,15), east has a boulder. Moving south to (38,16), then trying to push the boulder east again. If the boulder can't be moved east from (38,15), maybe from (38,16) there's space. Let's assume the agent moves south first. 

Another option is to move west to (37,15) and then check the other boulder. But the immediate goal is the eastern boulder. 

So the next action should be to move south to position (38,16) and then try pushing the boulder again from there. Alternatively, if moving south isn't possible (but there's no indication it's blocked), that's the way to go. 

The agent has already tried east, north, west, and south in various combinations. The key is to find a direction where the boulder can be pushed into the fountain. Since the fountain is east, perhaps pushing the boulder east one square at a time, but there's something blocking. Maybe the boulder is stuck against a wall or another obstacle. 

Wait, the observation says the boulder is adjacent east and northwest. So from the agent's position (38,15), the boulder is to the east (39,15). To push it east, there needs to be space at (40,15). If there's a fountain at (39,16) or similar, but according to the map, the fountain is very near eastnortheast. Maybe the fountain is at (39,16), so the boulder needs to be moved to (39,15) to reach it. If pushing east isn't working, maybe the boulder is blocked by another object. 

Alternatively, the agent could move north to (38,14) and then try pushing the boulder northeast. But the agent tried north earlier and hit bars. 

So the best immediate action is to move south to get around the boulder and try pushing it in a different direction. Let's choose south as the next action.

I need to figure out the next move in this Boxoban-like game. Let me look around based on the current observation.

The agent is a knight at position (38, 15). The inventory shows some items, but right now, the main goal is to push the boulder onto the fountain. The message says trying to move the boulder failed, which probably means it's blocked or there's an obstacle in the way.

From the map, it looks like there's a boulder to the east (adjacent). The fountains are near eastsoutheast and northnorthwest. The stairs are up westsouthwest, but maybe that's not needed yet. The agent is trying to push the boulder east, but it's not working. Maybe the boulder is stuck against another obstacle or the edge of the map.

Looking at the language observations, there are bars adjacent to the boulder to the east and northwest. The bars might be walls or unpassable objects. So the boulder can't be moved east because there's either a bar or another obstacle behind it. 

The agent needs to find a way to position the boulder so it can be pushed into a fountain. Since the boulder is adjacent to the agent (east), the agent could try moving west to get around, but the cursor shows the agent is already at (38,15). The previous attempts to move east resulted in failure because the boulder is stuck.

Maybe the agent should check other directions. To the south, there's a boulder adjacent southeast and south. Could moving south push that boulder? Or perhaps moving north to see if there's a path to reposition?

But the agent is at (38,15), and moving north would take them back to y=14. The map shows the agent's position with '<' which might mean facing south. Wait, the map's last line for y=9 has #<..``{.{# — the '<' is probably the agent facing south. So moving south would decrease the y-coordinate.

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to find a way to get the boulder from the current position to the fountain. The fountain is very near eastsoutheast, which is probably to the southeast of the agent's current position. But the boulder is at the east, adjacent. So perhaps the agent needs to move the boulder east, but it's blocked by bars. Maybe the bars are walls, so the boulder is against a wall and can't be pushed further east.

In that case, the agent should try to move the boulder in another direction, maybe west or north. But the boulder is already east of the agent. If the agent moves west, they could get behind the boulder and try to push it in a different direction. But the agent's current position is x=38, so west would be x=37. The boulder is at x=39, y=15. So if the agent moves west to x=37, y=15, then they could try pushing the boulder south or north?

But the agent's last action was south, and that failed. The boulder is adjacent east, so pushing it east is blocked. The agent might need to check if there's an opening to the south or north of the boulder. Alternatively, maybe there's a fountain to the southeast that the boulder needs to be pushed towards, but the path is blocked.

Looking at the map, the agent is on a path with various bars and dark areas. The key is to navigate the boulder around obstacles to reach the fountain. Since pushing east isn't working, the agent should explore other directions. Maybe moving north to see if there's a way to position the boulder towards the fountain in the eastsoutheast direction.

Alternatively, the agent could move south to see if there's a clearing. But previous attempts to move south also resulted in failure because the boulder is stuck. 

Another possibility is that the boulder is at the edge of the map, so it can't be pushed further. In that case, the agent needs to find another boulder or reposition the current one. But there's only one boulder mentioned here.

Wait, the language observation mentions ""boulder very near west,"" which is at x=37, y=15. The agent is at x=38, y=15. So the boulder to the west is at the same y but x=37. Maybe the agent can move west to x=37, y=15 and then try to push the west boulder in some direction.

But the current boulder the agent is trying to push is to the east. The agent is adjacent to that boulder (east). Maybe the agent needs to move around it. For example, move south to get below the boulder and then push it east-south or something. But the map might not allow that due to bars.

Alternatively, check if the fountain is in another direction. The fountain very near northnorthwest is probably up north. If the boulder can be pushed north, that might reach the fountain. Let's see: the agent is at (38,15). Moving north to y=14, x=38. The boulder is at x=39, y=15. If the agent moves north, they're at (38,14). Then, perhaps push the boulder north to (39,14), which could lead to the fountain in the northnorthwest direction.

But the language observation says ""fountain very near eastsoutheast and westnorthwest."" So westnorthwest would be towards the northwest part of the map. Maybe the boulder needs to be pushed there. 

This is getting a bit confusing. Let me summarize:

- Agent's position: (38,15), facing south (based on the '<' in the map).
- Boulder adjacent east (x=39, y=15), stuck because of bars.
- Fountains at eastsoutheast and westnorthwest.
- Bars blocking the eastern movement of the boulder.

Possible actions:

1. Move west to (37,15) and try to push the boulder east from there? But the boulder is already east of the agent's current position. Wait, the boulder very near west is at x=37, y=15. So the agent is next to two boulders? Or maybe the ""boulder very near west"" is the same as the one adjacent east?

Looking at the language observations: ""boulder adjacent east and northwest"" and ""boulder very near west."" So there's a boulder to the east (adjacent) and another to the west (very near). So the agent is between two boulders? Or maybe the western boulder is at x=37, y=15, and the eastern is at x=39, y=15. The agent is at x=38, y=15.

In that case, the agent could try to move the western boulder (x=37, y=15) to the east, perhaps towards the fountain at westnorthwest. But how?

The agent needs to get behind the western boulder. To do that, move west to x=37, y=15, then push the western boulder east. But the western boulder's position is x=37, y=15, so pushing it east would take it to x=38, y=15, which is where the agent is. That's not possible because the agent is there. So maybe the agent needs to move south or another direction to get around.

Alternatively, push the eastern boulder (x=39, y=15) north or south. But previous attempts to push east failed because of bars. The bars adjacent to the boulder could be walls, so pushing north or south might be possible if there's space.

Looking at the map, the agent's current position is part of a path with various symbols. The line for y=15 has ""#<..``{.{#"". The '<' is the agent, so to the east is '. ..`{.{#'. Maybe there's a way to the south or north from there.

If the agent moves south to y=16, x=38, then sees if they can push the eastern boulder south. But the message says trying to move the boulder failed, which might mean the direction is blocked.

Alternatively, the agent should look for the fountain locations. The fountain very near eastsoutheast would be southeast of the agent. To reach that, the boulder needs to be pushed southeast. But the boulder is at x=39, y=15. Pushing it southeast would require moving it to x=40, y=16, but is that possible?

The language observation says there are bars near eastsoutheast, so maybe that area is blocked. The dark area near southeast, south, southwest, etc., suggests those areas might be off-limits or blocked.

Given all this, the best approach might be to try moving the eastern boulder in a different direction, perhaps north. If the agent can push it north to (39,14), that might clear a path towards the westnorthwest fountain.

To do that, the agent needs to face north and push the boulder. But the agent is currently facing south. So first, turn north, then push. But the available actions are only movement (north, east, south, west). There's no action for turning. Wait, in Boxoban, you only move in directions, and the agent's facing direction matters for pushing. If the agent is facing south and tries to push a boulder to the east, they need to be positioned correctly.

Wait, in Boxoban, you push a boulder by moving into it from the direction you're facing. So if the agent is facing east and moves forward, they can push the boulder east. But in this case, the agent is facing south (based on the '<' in the map), and the boulder is to the east. To push the boulder east, the agent needs to be facing east and then move forward. But the agent is currently facing south.

So the agent needs to turn around. But since the available actions are only movement (north, east, south, west), turning would require moving in the direction they want to face. For example, to face east, the agent could move east, then east again, but that might not be efficient.

Alternatively, the agent can try to move north or south to change their position relative to the boulder. For example, moving north to y=14, then trying to push the boulder east.

But let's think step by step. Current position: (38,15), facing south. Boulder at (39,15). To push the boulder east, the agent needs to be facing east and move into it. Since the agent is facing south, they need to reposition. Maybe move west to (37,15), then north to (37,14), then east to (38,14), facing east, and then push the boulder east to (39,14). But this is speculative based on the map layout.

Alternatively, move south to (38,16), then see if pushing the boulder south is possible. The boulder is at (39,15), so moving it south would take it to (39,16). Check if that's possible. The language observation mentions ""bars very near southeast, south, southwest,"" so maybe that area is blocked.

Given the uncertainty in the map layout, perhaps the safest action is to move west to get behind the eastern boulder and try pushing it in a different direction. So move west to (37,15), then attempt to push the boulder east. But since the agent is now at (37,15), facing south, to push the boulder east, they need to move east into it. However, moving east from (37,15) would take them to (38,15), which is where the agent was before. That's not helpful.

Alternatively, move north from (38,15) to (38,14), then try to push the boulder east from there. If the agent moves north, they're facing north now (assuming the '<' changes direction with movement, but actually in Boxoban, the agent's icon direction indicates facing, and moving changes their position but not necessarily the facing unless specified). Wait, in NetHack and similar games, the agent's icon faces the direction they last moved. So if the agent was facing south and moves north, their icon might face north.

So moving north from (38,15) to (38,14) would make the agent face north. Then, moving east into the boulder at (39,15) would push it east to (40,15), if that's possible. The language observation says there are bars near eastnortheast and eastsoutheast, so (40,15) might be blocked by bars.

Alternatively, moving north and then trying to push the boulder north to (39,14). If that's possible, maybe it leads towards the westnorthwest fountain.

Given the limited information, the best guess is to try moving the boulder in a direction that's not blocked. Since pushing east is blocked, perhaps pushing north or south. The agent could move north to (38,14), then attempt to push the boulder north. If that's possible, the boulder would move to (39,14), and then maybe from there, push further.

But how to confirm? The language observation doesn't explicitly state blocks in those directions, just mentions bars in various areas. The key is to avoid the bars. 

Another approach: check the adjacent squares. The boulder at (39,15) has bars adjacent to it. The language observation says ""bars adjacent northeast and west"" for the boulder. So the boulder at (39,15) has bars to the northeast (39,16) and west (38,15), which is where the agent is. That explains why pushing east is blocked by a bar (either a wall or another obstacle).

Therefore, the boulder cannot be moved east because there's a bar in the way. The agent needs to find another way to move the boulder, perhaps north or south around the bar.

If the agent moves north to (38,14), then faces north, and tries to push the boulder north to (39,14), that might work if there's no bar there. The observation doesn't mention bars near (39,14), so it's possible.

So the sequence would be: move north to (38,14), then push the boulder north to (39,14). This would reposition the boulder away from the bars and towards the fountain in the westnorthwest direction.

Therefore, the chosen action is north to reposition, then push. But since the agent can only perform one action at a time, the first step is to move north.

",-0.001,False
16,west,"<reasoning>
Let's try to figure out the best action here. The agent is in Boxoban, right? So the goal is to push all the boulders onto the fountains.

Looking at the current position, the agent is at (38, 15). The map shows some fountains and a boulder near east. The messages indicate that trying to push boulders before hasn't worked, probably because there's something blocking them.

First, check the adjacent cells. To the east is a boulder, but pushing it failed earlier, so maybe there's a wall or another obstacle behind it. The stairs up are to the westsouthwest, but maybe the priority is to move the boulder towards the fountain eastsoutheast.

The agent was trying to move south multiple times, but that didn't work. Maybe they need to reposition to get a clear path to the boulder. Let's see the map layout. The cursor shows the agent's position with `<` indicating direction. The map has a lot of walls (##########) which are probably impassable.

The boulder is adjacent southeast and south. So maybe the boulder is to the southeast, and the agent needs to move in a direction that allows pushing it. If the agent can get to a position where they can push the boulder north or west towards the fountain, that would be better.

Looking at the language observations, there's a fountain very near eastsoutheast and westnorthwest. The boulder is very near west, which might be blocking the path to the fountain. If the agent can move the boulder from west to east, towards the fountain, that would solve the puzzle.

But how to do that? The agent is currently at (38,15). To the east is the boulder. If the agent moves east again, they might be next to the boulder. Then, perhaps a push action east? Wait, the available actions are only north, east, south, west. So to push the boulder, the agent needs to move into it from behind. But the agent is trying to move east into the boulder, which isn't working because they can't push unless they're behind.

Wait, in Boxoban, you push by walking into the boulder from the direction you want it to go. So if the agent is to the west of the boulder, they can move east into it, but that's just moving next to it. To push, they need to be behind it. So maybe the agent needs to move north or south to get behind the boulder.

Looking at the map, the agent is at (38,15). The boulder is adjacent southeast and south. So the boulder might be at (38,16) or (39,15). If the agent moves south to (38,16), then they can try to push the boulder east. But earlier attempts to move south resulted in ""in vain"" messages, perhaps because there's a wall or another obstacle.

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to go around the boulder. Since the boulder is near east, perhaps moving west to get a different angle. But the agent was trying west before, and there's a bars adjacent northwest, which might be walls.

Another approach: the stairs up are nearby, but the goal is to push the boulder, not use stairs. So focus on moving the boulder to the fountain. The fountain is near eastsoutheast, so the boulder needs to be pushed there.

If the boulder is at (39,15), then pushing it east would take it to (40,15), which is towards the fountain. But the agent is at (38,15). To push the boulder east, the agent needs to move into it from the west. So they need to be at (39,15) and then move east into the boulder, which would push it to (40,15).

But the agent is currently at (38,15). To get to (39,15), they need to move east once. But earlier attempts to move east resulted in ""in vain"" because maybe the boulder is there and they can't push it yet. Wait, the message says ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" So when the agent tried to move east, they were trying to push the boulder, but it didn't work. That implies that there's an obstacle behind the boulder, preventing it from being pushed east.

So perhaps the boulder is stuck because there's a wall or another obstacle behind it. The agent needs to find a way to move the boulder around that obstacle. Maybe by pushing it north or south first.

Looking at the map, the agent is at (38,15). The boulder is adjacent southeast and south. If the boulder is at (38,16) (south), then the agent could move south to (38,16) and try to push it east. But if moving south is blocked, that won't work. Alternatively, if the boulder is to the southeast (39,16), then the agent could move east to (39,15) and then north or south to position themselves to push.

But the problem is that when the agent tries to move east, they are likely trying to move into the boulder directly, which isn't allowed unless they can push it. Since pushing failed, there must be something blocking the boulder's path. The agent needs to navigate around to find a way to push the boulder in a direction that's free.

Another possibility: the agent is surrounded by bars (walls) on the north side. The message says ""You cannot pass through the bars"" when moving north. So the agent is blocked on the north by walls. That means they can't go north, so they have to work with the other directions.

The agent's current position is (38,15). To the east is the boulder. To the south, they tried moving but it didn't work. Maybe the path is blocked by another object. The goal is to get the boulder to the fountain eastsoutheast. So perhaps the agent needs to push the boulder south first, then east.

But how? If the boulder is at (38,16), pushing it south would take it to (38,17), but maybe that's blocked. The agent would need to check the map for obstacles in that direction. The map shows a lot of ########## which are walls, so perhaps pushing the boulder south is impossible.

Alternatively, maybe the boulder can be pushed west towards the fountain at westnorthwest. But the fountain eastsoutheast seems more relevant.

Wait, the language observation mentions a fountain very near eastsoutheast and westnorthwest. So there are two fountains. The boulder needs to be on one of them. The agent's priority is to push the boulder onto either fountain.

Given that the boulder is near east, maybe pushing it east towards the eastsoutheast fountain. But the agent can't push it east because there's an obstacle. So the agent needs to reposition.

Looking at the cursor position and the map, the agent is at (38,15). The map's ninth line (assuming y=15 is the ninth line) has ""#<..``{.{#"". The '<' indicates the agent's facing direction, which might be east since the previous actions were east, north, etc. So the agent is facing east.

To push the boulder east, they need to be behind it. So if the boulder is to the east at (39,15), the agent needs to be at (38,15) and move east into it, but that's just adjacency. To push, they need to be to the west of the boulder. Wait, no: in Boxoban, you push by moving into the boulder from the direction you want it to go. So if the agent is to the west of the boulder and moves east, the boulder moves east. If the agent is to the north and moves south, the boulder moves south, etc.

So if the boulder is at (39,15), and the agent is at (38,15) facing east, moving east would push the boulder to (40,15), but only if that space is empty or a fountain. However, previous attempts to move east resulted in failure, which suggests that the space beyond the boulder is blocked.

Looking at the map, the line for y=16 (assuming y increases downward) is ""#>`..{.`.#"". The '>' might be indicating a door or another feature, but it's unclear. The presence of bars and dark areas suggests there are walls or other obstacles.

Given the information, the best bet is to try to move around the boulder to a position where pushing is possible. Since moving east into the boulder isn't working, maybe moving south or north to get a better angle.

But the agent tried moving south and it didn't work. The message says ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain,"" which implies that the space behind the boulder is blocked. So the boulder is stuck against a wall or another obstacle.

In that case, the agent needs to find another boulder or interact with the environment differently. However, there's only one boulder mentioned.

Another possibility: the agent needs to use a different action, like picking up an item, but the available actions are only movement. So the focus remains on moving the boulder.

Given the agent's current position and the obstacles, the next logical move is to try moving west to see if there's a path around the boulder. Alternatively, move north if possible, but the bars are blocking that.

Wait, the latest observation says the agent tried moving north and got ""You cannot pass through the bars."" So north is blocked. The agent is at (38,15), north is blocked by bars. East is blocked by a boulder that can't be pushed. South also seems blocked. West might be possible.

If the agent moves west to (37,15), then they can try to look at the boulder from the west. Maybe the boulder is at (38,15) west, but that doesn't make sense. The boulder is adjacent southeast and south, so likely at (38,16) south or (39,15) east.

If the boulder is at (38,16), then moving south to (38,16) and then trying to push east. But moving south failed before. Maybe the space beyond is blocked.

Alternatively, if the boulder is at (39,15), then moving west to (38,15) and trying to push east into it. But that's the same as before.

Perhaps the agent needs to move the boulder north first. If the boulder is at (38,16), moving the agent to (38,16) and then pushing north. But the agent can't move north due to bars.

This is getting a bit stuck. Maybe the agent should try moving west to see if there's a way to maneuver the boulder. Let's choose west as the next action, hoping that there's a path there.

17,south,"<reasoning>
Let's try to figure out the best move here. The agent is in Boxoban, right? The goal is to push boulders onto fountains. Let me check the current observations.

The agent is positioned at (37, 15). The map shows some walls (##########), bars (maybe obstacles?), and fountains. The inventory has some items, but not sure if they're relevant right now. The main task is moving the boulders.

Looking at the language observations, there's a boulder very near eastsoutheast and adjacent southeast and south. The fountains are near east and eastsoutheast. So the goal is to push the boulder towards the fountain.

The agent tried moving east before, but got a message saying they tried to move the boulder but failed. That probably means there's a boulder in the way. Wait, the boulder is adjacent southeast and south. So if the agent is at (38,15) earlier, moving east would hit the boulder. But now the agent is back at (37,15). 

Let me see the map again. The cursor is at (37,15), which has a '@' symbol. The line below (y=16) has '#<..``{.{#'. So maybe the boulder is to the southeast or south. The agent needs to position themselves to push the boulder towards the fountain.

Since the boulder is adjacent southeast and south, perhaps the agent should move south to get behind the boulder and then push it. Or move southeast to try pushing it directly. But the message says ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain"" when trying east before, which was probably adjacent to the boulder.

So if the boulder is to the southeast, moving southeast might allow the agent to push it south into the fountain. Alternatively, moving south to get next to the boulder and then pushing southwards.

Wait, the fountains are very near eastsoutheast and westnorthwest. The eastsoutheast fountain is a target. The boulder is very near eastsoutheast, so maybe it's just outside the fountain. The agent needs to get the boulder into that fountain.

Looking at the cursor position (37,15), moving southeast would take them to (38,16). Let's check if that's possible. The map at y=16, x=38 is shown as '#<..``{.{#', which might have a '<' indicating a staircase up, but not sure. The boulder is adjacent southeast and south. So maybe moving south to (37,16) could get the agent next to the boulder.

Alternatively, moving east to (38,15) is where the boulder is adjacent. But trying to move east there previously didn't work because the boulder is blocking. So perhaps the agent needs to move around the boulder.

Wait, the boulder is adjacent southeast and south. So from (37,15), southeast would be (38,16), and south is (37,16). If the boulder is at (38,15) or (37,16), then moving south to (37,16) might allow the agent to push the boulder south into the fountain at eastsoutheast.

Alternatively, if the boulder is at (38,16), then moving southeast (to (38,16)) might allow pushing it further. But the agent's current position is (37,15). So moving east to (38,15) is adjacent to the boulder, but that's where the previous attempt failed. So maybe the agent needs to move south to (37,16), which is adjacent to the boulder's south position.

Once the agent is at (37,16), they can try pushing the boulder south into the fountain. So the sequence would be: move south to (37,16), then push south.

But in the current observation, the agent is at (37,15). So the next action should be south to get to (37,16), which is adjacent to the boulder. Then, from there, push the boulder south into the fountain.

Let me try to figure out what to do next in this Boxoban game. The agent is a knight trying to push boulders onto fountains. Let's look at the current situation.

From the observations, the cursor is at (37, 16). The map shows some bars and dark areas, but the key elements are the boulder adjacent to the east and northwest of the knight. There's a fountain very near eastnortheast and northnorthwest. The boulder very near east might be the one we need to push.

The message says that when trying to move the boulder, it doesn't budge. That probably means there's an obstacle behind it where it's stuck. Let me check the map again. The map shows `#<.@``{.{#` on line 9, which is probably the knight's position. The boulder is adjacent east and northwest. So, the knight is at (37,16), and the boulder is east of that, at (38,16), maybe. But when the agent tried to move south, north, etc., the boulder couldn't be moved. That suggests there's something blocking the path behind the boulder.

Looking at the ""bars adjacent southeast, south, and southwest"" in the language observation, maybe there are walls or obstacles in those directions. If the boulder is east of the knight, pushing it east towards the fountain (which is eastnortheast) would require clearing the path. But if there's a bar or wall behind the boulder, the knight can't push it further.

The agent's last action was west, moving back to (37,15). Now, at (37,16), perhaps the knight should try to move in a direction that allows pushing the boulder. Let's see: the boulder is adjacent east and northwest. So, the knight is west of the boulder. To push the boulder east towards the fountain, the knight needs to be next to it and move in the direction opposite to where they want to push. Wait, no: in Sokoban-like games, you push by moving into the boulder, which then moves into the next tile. So if the knight is west of the boulder, to push it east, the knight would move east into the boulder's space, causing it to move east.

But in the current position, the knight is at (37,16), and the boulder is adjacent east (so at (38,16)). If the knight moves east to (38,16), that's into the boulder's space. However, the message says that trying to move the boulder results in failure, which implies that the tile behind the boulder is blocked. So maybe the boulder is at (38,16), and the tile east of it (39,16) is blocked by a bar or wall. If that's the case, the knight can't push the boulder further east.

Alternatively, maybe the boulder is at (37,15) (northwest adjacent), but the knight is at (37,16). Let me check the map again. The map line for y=9 (assuming y increases downward) has `#<.@``{.{#`, which might indicate the knight's position with `<` and other characters. The boulder adjacent east and northwest could be at (38,16) (east) and (37,15) (northwest). If the knight is at (37,16), moving northwest would take them to (36,15), but the boulder is already adjacent there. So pushing the boulder from the northwest side would require moving into (37,15), which is where the boulder's northwest side is. But again, if the tile behind the boulder is blocked, pushing won't work.

The stairs up are very near westsouthwest, which is probably not immediately relevant. The fountains are near east and eastnortheast. The goal is to get the boulder onto the fountain at eastnortheast. So maybe the boulder needs to be moved one step east first. But since the knight can't push it, perhaps there's an obstacle. Let me check the language observations again. The bars very near north, northeast, etc., might be walls or barriers.

Looking at the bars adjacent southeast, south, and southwest, those could be walls around the boulder's possible path. If the boulder is at (38,16), and moving east would take it to (39,16), which is blocked by a bar, then the knight can't push it further. In that case, the knight needs to find another way to position the boulder. Maybe moving it in a different direction first.

Alternatively, maybe the boulder is at (37,15) (northwest adjacent to the knight's position at (37,16)). If the knight moves north to (37,15), they could try to push the boulder south. But again, if the path behind is blocked, that won't work. The message about failing to move the boulder suggests that the path is blocked.

Another possibility is that the boulder is stuck because there's another boulder behind it, but the observations don't mention multiple boulders. The agent needs to navigate around the obstacles and find a way to free up the boulder's path. Since the previous attempts to move south or other directions didn't work, maybe the knight should try moving in a different direction, like west again, or north to see if there's a way to reposition.

Wait, the latest observation after moving south shows the cursor at (38,15) but then after moving south again, the message says ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" Maybe the boulder is now at (38,15), and trying to push it south is blocked. Hmm, the exact positions are a bit confusing without seeing the map layout clearly.

Alternatively, perhaps the knight should try to move around the boulder to a side where it can be pushed without obstruction. For example, if the boulder is at (38,16), and the knight is at (37,16), moving east into the boulder's space would push it east if the next tile is free. But if the next tile is blocked (by a bar or another obstacle), then it's impossible. The agent's previous attempts to move south might have been trying to push the boulder south, which is blocked.

Given that the agent is stuck trying to push the boulder, perhaps the best next step is to try moving in a different direction to see if there's a way to reposition. For instance, moving west back to (37,15) and then trying to push the boulder north or south if possible. Alternatively, check if there's a way to move the boulder to the northwest direction towards the fountain.

Another angle: the fountain is at eastnortheast, which is probably a specific coordinate. The boulder needs to be moved there. If the current position of the boulder is east of the knight, but can't be pushed further east due to a block, maybe the knight should move the boulder in another direction first and then come back. For example, push it north or south if those paths are clear.

Looking at the map, the knight's current position is at (37,16). The bars very near north, northeast, etc., might mean that moving north is blocked. The dark areas might be out of bounds or unseen areas. The stairs up are westsouthwest, so maybe not immediately useful.

In summary, the agent needs to find a way to push the boulder past the obstacle blocking its path towards the fountain. Since direct attempts to push east or south haven't worked, the knight should explore moving around the boulder to a side where movement is possible. Possible actions could be moving west to (37,15), then trying to push the boulder north or south if those directions are clear. Alternatively, move north or east to see if there's a clearer path.

Given the latest cursor position at (37,16) after moving west, perhaps the next step is to try moving north or south again, but in a different direction. Alternatively, check if moving east into the boulder's space works when there's no obstruction behind it. However, previous attempts suggest there is an obstruction.

Another possibility is that the boulder is adjacent to a wall, making it impossible to push further. In that case, the agent might need to move the boulder to a different position where it can be pushed towards the fountain. For example, if the boulder can be pushed west or north, then later east once the path is clear.

Given the information, the safest bet might be to move the knight in a direction that allows repositioning relative to the boulder. Since the last valid action was west to (37,15), maybe moving north or south from there could help. However, the bars adjacent to the boulder's position might block those movements.

Alternatively, the agent could try to move the boulder in the northwest direction. If the boulder is at (37,15), moving the knight to (36,15) and then pushing the boulder east. But without knowing the exact map layout, it's challenging.

Considering all this, the most logical next action would be to attempt to push the boulder again but in a different direction. Since previous attempts to push south resulted in failure, maybe trying to push north or east from a different position. However, given the cursor's current position at (37,16), moving east into the boulder's space (38,16) might be the only option, but it failed before because the path behind is blocked. So perhaps the agent needs to find another way.

Wait, the latest observation after moving south to (38,15) showed the same message about not being able to move the boulder. So maybe the boulder is now at (38,15), and pushing it south is blocked. In that case, the knight could try moving west back to (37,15) and then pushing the boulder north or east.

But how to determine the correct direction? Let's think again. The fountain is near eastnortheast, which is probably (39,17) or similar. The boulder needs to be moved there. If the boulder is at (38,15), pushing it east to (39,15) might be possible if that tile is free. But the message says earlier attempts failed, so maybe that tile is blocked.

Alternatively, the boulder is at (37,15) (northwest of the knight at (37,16)), and pushing it south to (37,16) would require the knight to move into it. But the knight is already there. This is getting a bit confusing without a clear map.

Given the uncertainty, the best possible action might be to explore surrounding areas to find a path around the boulder. Moving west again to (37,15), then north or south to see if there's a clear path. Alternatively, move east to (38,16) and try pushing the boulder again, but in a different direction.

Since the previous attempts to push resulted in failure, perhaps the agent should try moving in a cardinal direction that's not directly pushing the boulder but allows repositioning. For example, moving north to (37,17) if possible, but the bars near north might block that.

Another idea: the agent's inventory has a +1 long sword and a lance, but in Boxoban, you don't fight monsters; you push boulders. So weapons might not be useful here. The key is to navigate and push boulders using the right movements.

Given all this, the next logical action is to try pushing the boulder again but in a different direction. Since moving south didn't work, maybe moving east into the boulder's space and pushing it north or east. Wait, if the knight moves east into the boulder, the boulder would move east if the next tile is free. But if that's blocked, it won't work. Alternatively, moving north into the boulder's space to push it north.

But without knowing the exact layout, it's hard to be certain. The safest bet is to continue trying to push the boulder in the direction towards the fountain, even if it's failing, perhaps in the hope that the environment has changed. Alternatively, move around to a side where pushing is possible.

Given the information, I'll choose to move east again into the boulder's space, hoping that perhaps the previous blockage was temporary or I'm misunderstanding the map layout. Alternatively, move west to reposition.

",-0.001,False
19,west,"<reasoning>
Let's try to figure out the best action here. The agent is in a Boxoban-like environment, trying to push boulders onto fountains. From the observations, there's a boulder near the eastnortheast and another very near east. There's a fountain near east and another very near eastnortheast and northnorthwest. The agent's current position is (37, 16).

First, the agent tried moving east, south, west, and north previously, but some actions hit bars or failed to move the boulder. The latest message says ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" That probably means the agent was trying to push a boulder but couldn't because it's blocked or there's something behind it.

Looking at the map, the agent is at (37,16). The east direction seems to have a boulder very near east. Maybe the agent needs to move towards that boulder to push it. But the previous attempts to move east resulted in the message about the boulder not moving. Maybe the boulder is blocked by another obstacle or it's at the edge of the map.

The stairs are up very near westsouthwest, so maybe there's a way to go up there, but the current goal is to push boulders onto fountains. The fountain is adjacent east, so if the agent can push the boulder towards the east fountain, that would solve the level.

Wait, the language observation mentions ""boulder adjacent east and northwest"" at the current position. So the agent is next to a boulder to the east and northwest. The agent's current position is (37,16). If the boulder is adjacent east, then trying to move east into the boulder would push it. But previous attempts to move east resulted in the message ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" Maybe there's something blocking the boulder's path. 

Looking at the map, the line for the agent's position is ""#<.@``{.{#"". The '<' is the agent facing south. The boulder is at (38,16) perhaps, but east of the agent. If the agent tries to move east (which is towards (38,16)), but the boulder is there, so pushing it would require that the space behind the boulder is free. However, the message says it's in vain, so maybe the boulder is at the edge or blocked by another obstacle like a wall or bars.

The bars are mentioned in various directions. The bars adjacent southeast, south, and southwest. So moving south might be blocked by bars. The agent is at (37,16). Moving south to (37,17) might be blocked by bars. That could explain why pushing the boulder east didn't work—maybe the boulder is against a wall or another boulder.

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to move the boulder northwest. Since the boulder is adjacent northwest, which would be (36,16). If the agent moves northwest, that might allow the boulder to be pushed into the fountain at (37,15) or similar. But the fountain adjacent east is at (38,15) perhaps?

Wait, the fountain adjacent east would be in the direction the agent is facing east. If the agent pushes the boulder east, it would go towards (38,16), but if there's a fountain at (38,15), maybe the boulder needs to be moved south as well. But the agent's current y-coordinate is 16, so moving south would take them to 17, which might be blocked by bars.

Alternatively, the agent could try to move north to a position where the boulder can be pushed towards the fountain. The fountain very near eastnortheast and northnorthwest. Maybe positioning the boulder near the northnorthwest fountain.

But given the agent's current position and the adjacency of the boulder to the east and northwest, perhaps the best move is to try pushing the boulder to the northwest. So the action would be northwest. Alternatively, since the boulder is adjacent east, pushing it east by moving east into it. But previous attempts failed, so maybe the path is blocked.

Looking at the map, the agent's line is ""#<.@``{.{#"". The '<' is facing south. To the east (next cell) is the boulder. If the agent moves east, they would be next to the boulder, but trying to push it would require the space beyond the boulder to be free. The message says it's in vain, implying that the space behind the boulder is blocked. So maybe there's a wall or another obstacle there.

In that case, the agent needs to find another way to position the boulder. Since there's a fountain adjacent east, perhaps moving the boulder south into the fountain. But moving the boulder south would require the agent to be to the north of the boulder and push it south. However, the agent is currently at (37,16), and the boulder is at (38,16). To push it south to (38,17), the agent would need to be at (38,16) and move south. But the agent is at (37,16), so moving east to (38,16) and then pushing south. But previous attempts to move east didn't work because the boulder couldn't be moved. Maybe the path south from (38,16) is blocked by bars.

The bars adjacent southeast, south, and southwest at the agent's current position. So moving south from (37,16) to (37,17) is blocked by bars. Therefore, pushing the boulder south is impossible because it would go into a barred area.

Alternatively, the agent could try to move the boulder northwest. The boulder is adjacent northwest at (36,16). If the agent moves northwest to (36,15), they can push the boulder northwest to (35,15), which might be towards the fountain at northnorthwest. But the agent's current position is (37,16), so moving northwest would take them to (36,15). Then pushing the boulder northwest would be to (35,15). If there's a fountain at (35,15), that would solve it. However, the fountain very near eastnortheast and northnorthwest—maybe the northnorthwest fountain is at (35,15).

This is a bit confusing without seeing the exact map layout. But based on the observations, the agent should attempt to push the adjacent boulder in a direction that leads it to a fountain. Since pushing east didn't work, maybe trying northwest or another direction.

Another possibility is that the agent needs to move to a different position to gain access to push the boulder. For example, moving west to (36,16) and then trying to push the boulder east. But the boulder is already adjacent east. Maybe the agent is blocking the boulder's path?

Wait, the agent is at (37,16), facing south. The boulder is adjacent east at (38,16). If the agent moves east to (38,16), they would be next to the boulder. Then, pushing the boulder east would require moving to (39,16), but if that's blocked, it won't work. However, the previous attempt to move east just resulted in the message about the boulder not moving, so maybe the agent didn't actually move, just tried to command the push.

Wait, in Boxoban, to push a boulder, the agent must move into it, and the cell behind the boulder must be free. So if the agent is at (37,16) and the boulder is at (38,16), the agent can move east to (38,16), which would push the boulder to (39,16) if that cell is free. But the message says it's in vain, meaning (39,16) is blocked. So perhaps there's a bar or another obstacle there.

Given that, the agent needs to find another way. Maybe moving the other boulder that's very near eastsoutheast. But how?

Alternatively, the agent could move south to (37,17), but that's blocked by bars. So that's not an option. Moving north to (37,15) might be possible. If the agent moves north, they can then position themselves to push the boulder from the north.

The fountain adjacent northwest is at (37,15) perhaps. So if the agent moves north to (37,15), then they can push the boulder northwest to (36,15), which is the fountain. But the boulder in question is the one at (38,16). To push it northwest, the agent would need to be to the north and west of it. This might require a series of moves.

Alternatively, the agent could move west to (36,16) and then try to push the boulder east into (37,16), but that's where the agent is, so that wouldn't help. Maybe pushing the boulder north? From (38,16) to (38,15), but the agent would need to be at (38,16) to push it north. If the agent moves east to (38,16), then pushes north to (38,15), which might be a fountain.

Looking at the language observation, there's a fountain adjacent northwest. The agent is at (37,16). The fountain adjacent northwest would be at (36,15) or similar. If the boulder can be moved to (36,15), that would solve it. So the agent needs to get the boulder there.

To do that, the agent would need to move to (38,16), push the boulder north to (38,15), then possibly move west to (37,15) and push it north again? But this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, the agent could try to move the other boulder that's very near eastsoutheast. But I'm not sure of its position. The language observation mentions ""boulder very near west"" and ""boulder adjacent southeast and south"". So maybe there's a boulder at (37,17) or (38,17).

In any case, the immediate problem is the boulder adjacent east that can't be moved. The agent needs to find a way to push it. Since moving east didn't work, perhaps the agent needs to move around to the side and push it in a different direction.

Given the agent's current position and the available moves, perhaps the best action is to try pushing the boulder northwest. So the action would be northwest. Alternatively, move north to (37,15) and then try pushing the boulder from there.

But the agent's last action was south, which moved them to (37,16). The current position is (37,16). The boulder is adjacent east at (38,16). If the agent moves east to (38,16), then tries to push the boulder north to (38,15), which might be a free space. If that's possible, then the boulder would reach the fountain adjacent northwest, which is at (38,15) perhaps.

So the sequence would be: move east to (38,16), then push north to (38,15). But the problem is that the previous attempt to move east just resulted in the message about the boulder not moving, implying that the cell beyond the boulder is blocked. So if the agent moves east, they would be next to the boulder, and then trying to push it north would require the cell (38,15) to be free. If that's a fountain, that's good. But if it's blocked, then it's not possible.

Given the uncertainty, the best next action is probably to try pushing the boulder in a direction that might lead it to a fountain. Since the agent is at (37,16) with a boulder at (38,16), moving east to (38,16) and then trying to push north towards the fountain at (38,15). So the action would be northeast? Wait, no. To push the boulder north, the agent needs to move north into the boulder. So from (38,16), moving north would push the boulder to (38,15). So the agent needs to first move east to (38,16), then move north to push it.

But since the agent is at (37,16), the action to move east is required first. However, the previous attempt to move east resulted in the message ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" Which suggests that even though the agent moved east, the boulder couldn't be pushed because the path was blocked. So maybe moving east is possible, but pushing it isn't.

Alternatively, perhaps the agent is already adjacent to the boulder and needs to just push it. Maybe the mistake was not moving correctly. For example, in Boxoban, you have to enter the boulder's cell to push it. So if the agent is at (37,16) and the boulder is at (38,16), moving east to (38,16) would allow them to push it. But if that results in the message about the boulder not moving, then the path behind is blocked.

Given that the agent's last action was south, moving them to (37,16), and the boulder is at (38,16), maybe the agent should try moving east again. Even though it failed before, perhaps there was a change in the environment. But according to the current observation, the situation is the same.

Alternatively, maybe the agent should look for another boulder. The language observation mentions ""boulder very near west"", which might be at (36,16). If the agent moves west to (36,16), they can try to push that boulder east towards the fountain.

So the possible actions are:

1. Move east to try pushing the adjacent boulder again.
2. Move west to the boulder near west and try pushing it.
3. Move north to find a different path.
4. Move south, but it's blocked by bars.

Considering the previous failed attempts to move east, maybe moving west to the other boulder is a better option. The boulder very near west is at (36,16), I think. So the agent could move west to (36,16), then try pushing it east into (37,16), which is the current position. But that wouldn't help much. Alternatively, pushing it further east to (38,16), where the other boulder is. But that might create a block.

Alternatively, pushing the west boulder north into (36,15), which could be a fountain. The fountain adjacent northwest is at (36,15), perhaps. So moving west to (36,16), then pushing north to (36,15) onto the fountain.

That seems plausible. So the steps would be:

- Move west to (36,16).
- Move north to push the boulder to (36,15), which is a fountain.

Therefore, the action should be west, then north. But the agent needs to choose one action at a time.

Since the agent is currently at (37,16), the first action to take is west to (36,16), then from there push north. So the immediate action is west.

",-0.001,False
20,Failed to obtain a valid action from the reasoning.,"<reasoning>
I need to figure out how to push the boulders to the fountains in this Boxoban level. Let me look at the current situation.

The agent is at position (36, 16). The map shows that there's a boulder very near the east, specifically at (37, 16). The nearest fountain is to the eastnortheast and east, which is probably at (38, 15) or (37, 15). Wait, the cursor shows the knight's position as (36, 16), and the map line 9 (since y=15 is line 9, assuming the first line is y=1?) has ""#<@.``{.{#"". So the '@' is at position (x=37, y=15)? Wait, maybe the coordinates are a bit confusing. Let me parse the map again.

The map lines correspond to y-coordinates. The first line (top) is y=1, and the ninth line (assuming the map has 10 lines as shown) is y=9. Wait, the cursor is at (37, y=16), but looking at the map provided, the lines are labeled up to y=9. Hmm, maybe the map in the problem is a bit different. Let me check the map structure again.

The map shown has 9 lines for the game area, each line seems to represent a row. The cursor's y-coordinate is 15, but the map only shows up to y=9. That's confusing. Maybe there's a misalignment in the way coordinates are displayed. Alternatively, perhaps the map's lines are offset. Let me try to visualize it.

The map as given has lines that are probably part of a larger grid, but in the problem's observation, only a portion is shown. The key elements are:

- The agent (knight) is at (37, 15) initially, then moves to (38,15), then (37,15), etc.
- There's a boulder adjacent southeast and south at (38,15) in some observations.
- A fountain is adjacent east at (38,15).
- Stairs up are at westsouthwest, which might be at (34,15) or similar.

The goal is to push the boulder onto the fountain. The boulder is near the east, and the fountain is east of the agent. The agent needs to position themselves to push the boulder towards the fountain.

In the latest observation, the agent is at (36,16), and there's a boulder very near the east. The message says ""boulder very near east"", so likely at (37,16) or (38,16). The fountain is very near north, eastnortheast, and east. So maybe the fountain is at (37,15) or (38,15).

The agent is at (36,16). To push the boulder east, the agent needs to move into the boulder's position from the west. So if the boulder is at (37,16), the agent can move east to (37,16) and then push it further east. But the problem is that in the current observation, the message after moving west says ""boulder adjacent east and northwest"", which might mean the boulder is at (37,16), and the agent is at (36,16). So the boulder is to the east of the agent.

The agent's current position is (36,16). The boulder is adjacent east, so at (37,16). The fountain is very near eastnortheast and east, so perhaps at (38,15) or (37,15). Wait, the fountain adjacent east would be at (37,15), which is south of the boulder's current position (37,16). To push the boulder onto the fountain, the agent needs to move the boulder south to (37,15). But the boulder is currently at (37,16), and the fountain is at (37,15). So the agent can push the boulder south into the fountain.

But how to get there? The agent is at (36,16). To reach the boulder at (37,16), the agent needs to move east. However, moving east from (36,16) to (37,16) would be into the boulder. But since the boulder is there, the agent can try to push it. But the message says ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" when attempting to push it. So maybe the boulder is blocked.

Looking at the latest observation, the bars adjacent southeast, south, and southwest. Maybe there are obstacles (like walls or bars) south and southwest of the agent, preventing the boulder from being pushed in certain directions.

Wait, the latest language observation says: ""boulder adjacent east and northwest"", and ""bars adjacent southeast, south, and southwest"". So the boulder is to the east (37,16), and there are bars to the southeast, south, and southwest of the agent's current position (36,16). That means the agent is surrounded by bars on those sides, making it difficult to push the boulder south or west.

The stairs up are adjacent west, so at (35,16). But the agent needs to get the boulder to the fountain. Let's think again. The fountain is very near north, so maybe the fountain is at (36,15), which is north of the agent's current position (36,16). But the boulder is at (37,16), so pushing it north into the fountain at (36,15) might not be possible due to bars or other obstacles.

Alternatively, the fountain could be at (38,15), which is east and south of the agent. To push the boulder from (37,16) to (38,15), the agent would need to move the boulder south-east. But the bars are adjacent southeast, south, and southwest, which might block that path.

Wait, the bars are adjacent southeast, south, and southwest of the agent's current position (36,16). So moving south from (36,16) would take the agent into a bar, which is not allowed. Similarly, moving southwest would also hit a bar. Therefore, pushing the boulder south from (37,16) is blocked because the agent can't move south themselves due to the bars.

Hmm, this is tricky. The agent needs to find a way to move the boulder around the obstacles. Let's look at the inventory. The agent has a +1 long sword and a lance, but those might not be necessary for pushing boulders. The important thing is to position the agent next to the boulder and push it in the desired direction.

Given the current position (36,16) and the boulder at (37,16), the agent can move east to (37,16) and then attempt to push the boulder. However, the problem is that after moving east, the next action would be to push south or another direction. But the bars are blocking the south and southwest, so pushing south might not work.

Alternatively, maybe the agent should move the boulder west towards the stairs up. But the stairs are west of the agent, and pushing the boulder west would require the agent to be north of the boulder. Wait, the boulder is at (37,16). To push it west, the agent needs to be at (37,15) and move west, but the agent is at (36,16). That might not be feasible.

Another approach: Check if there's a way to get around the bars. The agent could move north, but the latest observation says the agent is at (36,16) with bars adjacent southeast, south, and southwest. The agent's current position is (36,16), so north would be (36,15). Is there a path north? The bars are far north initially, but as the agent moves, the observations change. Let me check the previous observations.

In earlier steps, the agent moved south multiple times but hit bars. Now, the agent is at (36,16) with bars to the south and southwest. Maybe moving north to (36,15) is possible. Let's see the map line for y=15 (assuming the first line is y=1). The map line for y=15 is ""#.`..{.`.#"", which at x=37 is a '{', which might be a wall or obstacle. So moving north from (36,16) to (36,15) would enter a '.' which is floor, so that's possible.

So the plan could be:

1. Move north to (36,15) to avoid the bars south and southwest.
2. Then move east to (37,15), which is adjacent to the boulder at (37,16).
3. Push the boulder south from (37,16) to (37,15), which is the fountain.

But wait, the boulder is at (37,16), and the fountain is at (37,15). So if the agent can push the boulder south into that spot, the goal is achieved.

To do that:

- Agent moves north to (36,15).
- Then moves east to (37,15).
- Then pushes the boulder south from (37,16) to (37,15).

But the agent needs to be adjacent to the boulder to push it. So after moving to (37,15), the agent is north of the boulder at (37,16). Then, pushing the boulder south would move it to (37,15), which is the fountain.

However, the current observation shows that the boulder is adjacent east and northwest. Wait, in the latest observation, the boulder is adjacent east and northwest of the agent's position (36,16). So the boulder is at (37,16) (east) and maybe (35,15) (northwest)? That might not be correct. Let me clarify.

The language observation says: ""boulder adjacent east and northwest"" from the agent's position (36,16). So east is (37,16), and northwest is (35,15). But the boulder is very near east, so probably (37,16) is the main one. The other adjacent could be another boulder, but the problem mentions ""boulder very near west"" in some observations, but here it's adjacent east and northwest.

In any case, the main boulder is at (37,16). The agent is at (36,16). To push it, the agent needs to move east into the boulder's position. So action east to (37,16), then push south.

But when the agent tries to move east, they would be trying to walk into the boulder, which requires pushing. The message says ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" which implies that the push is not possible, perhaps because there's an obstacle behind the boulder.

Looking at the bars adjacent to the agent: southeast, south, southwest. So from (36,16), moving south would hit a bar, so the boulder can't be pushed south. Moving southeast is blocked by a bar. What about pushing the boulder north? The agent is at (36,16), boulder at (37,16). Pushing north would move the boulder to (37,15), which might be clear.

But the fountain is very near north, eastnortheast, and east. If the fountain is at (37,15), then pushing the boulder there would solve the problem. However, the agent needs to move the boulder north into that spot.

But can the agent push the boulder north? The agent is at (36,16), moves east to (37,16), then pushes north to (37,15). Is there a bar or obstacle in (37,15)? The map line for y=15 (assuming it's the 9th line in the map) is ""#.`..{.`.#"". At x=37, that's a '{', which might be a wall. So pushing the boulder north into (37,15) would be impossible if there's a wall there.

Alternatively, if the fountain is at a different location. Let me re-examine the language observations.

The latest language observation says: ""fountain very near north, eastnortheast, and east"". So near the agent's current position (36,16), the fountain is to the north, eastnortheast, and east. So perhaps the fountain is at (36,15) (north), (37,17) (eastnortheast), or (37,16) (east). But the boulder is at (37,16), which is east of the agent. If the fountain is at (37,16), then the boulder is already there, but the message says ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain,"" which might mean it's already on a fountain. But that doesn't make sense because the goal is to have all boulders on fountains.

Wait, perhaps there are multiple fountains and boulders. The initial observations mention a boulder near east and a fountain near eastsoutheast. In later steps, the fountain very near eastnortheast and east. It's a bit confusing, but the key is to get the boulder to a fountain.

Assuming the fountain is at (37,15), which is south of the boulder's current position (37,16), and the agent is at (36,16), the agent needs to push the boulder south. But the bars are blocking the agent's movement south, making it impossible for the agent to push the boulder that way.

Another possibility: The agent can move west to avoid the bars and then approach the boulder from another direction. But the agent is already west of the boulder at (36,16) compared to the boulder's east position (37,16). Moving west further would take the agent away.

Alternatively, the agent could move north to (36,15), then east to (37,15), and then push the boulder south to (37,14), but there's no information about fountains further south.

This is getting complicated. Let me try to see the possible actions and their outcomes.

Current position: (36,16)

Possible actions:

- north: moves to (36,15). The map at y=15 (assuming it's the 9th line) has ""#.`..{.`.#"" at x=36 is a '.', which is floor. So possible.
- east: moves to (37,16), which is the boulder. Trying to push it.
- south: blocked by bars.
- west: moves to (35,16). The map at y=16 (10th line) is ""#<@.``{.{#"", at x=35 is a '<', which is the agent's previous position. So west is possible.

If the agent moves north to (36,15), then east to (37,15), which is adjacent to the boulder at (37,16). Then, push the boulder south to (37,15). But is (37,15) a fountain? The language observation says ""fountain very near north, eastnortheast, and east"". If the fountain is at (37,15), then this would work.

However, the map's y=15 line at x=37 is a '{', which might be a wall. So pushing the boulder into a wall would not be possible. Therefore, the fountain must be elsewhere.

Wait, the latest message says ""fountain very near eastnortheast and east"". Eastnortheast of (36,16) would be (37,17), and east is (37,16). If the fountain is at (37,17), then pushing the boulder east to (37,17) would be the solution. But the agent's position is (36,16), so moving east to (37,16) (the boulder) and then pushing east to (37,17).

But can the agent push the boulder east? The agent would need to be north of the boulder to push it east. After moving east to (37,16), the agent can push the boulder east to (37,17), assuming there's no obstacle there.

Looking at the map line for y=16 (10th line): ""#<@.``{.{#"". At x=37, it's a '{', which is a wall. So pushing the boulder east into (37,17) would hit a wall, making it impossible.

This is really tricky. Maybe the correct approach is to move the boulder west towards the stairs up. The stairs are adjacent west at (35,16). So if the agent can push the boulder west from (37,16) to (36,16), but the agent is already at (36,16). That wouldn't help.

Alternatively, push the boulder north into a fountain. If the fountain is at (36,15), which is north of the agent's current position. The agent moves north to (36,15), then pushes the boulder north to (37,14), but there's no info about a fountain there.

I think I'm stuck. Let me try to look for the fountain's location again. The initial observations mentioned fountains near eastsoutheast and east. In the latest observation, the fountain is very near eastnortheast and east. So maybe the fountain is at (38,15) or (37,15).

Assuming the fountain is at (37,15), the agent needs to push the boulder from (37,16) to (37,15). But the agent can't move south due to bars. So the only way is to find a way around the bars.

Wait, the agent can move north to (36,15), which is clear (floor '.'), then east to (37,15), which is adjacent to the boulder at (37,16). Then, push the boulder south into (37,15). But if (37,15) is a floor and the fountain is there, this would work. However, the map shows that at y=15, x=37 is a '{', which is a wall. So that's not possible.

This suggests that perhaps the fountain is elsewhere. Maybe the fountain is at (38,15), which is eastsoutheast of the agent's current position (36,16). To get the boulder there, the agent would need to push it southeast. But the bars are adjacent southeast, so that's blocked.

At this point, I'm not sure. The agent might need to try different directions, but given the obstacles, the only feasible action might be to move north to avoid the bars and then attempt to push the boulder in a possible direction.

So the next action could be to move north to (36,15), then east to (37,15), and then push the boulder south. Even though the map shows a wall at (37,15), perhaps the observation is outdated or there's a different configuration.

Alternatively, the agent could try to move the boulder west into the stairs up area. But pushing west from (37,16) to (36,16) would require the agent to be at (37,15) to push it west, which is not possible due to the bars.

Given the information, the best bet might be to move east to the boulder and try to push it north into a possible fountain location, even if the map shows a wall","

Let me try to figure out what to do next here. The agent is in Boxoban, a Sokoban-like game. The goal is to push boulders onto fountains. Let's look at the current observation.

First, the inventory shows there's a boulder nearby. The previous action was north, which allowed moving the boulder. The message says ""With great effort you move the boulder,"" so that action worked. Now, the boulder is adjacent north. Wait, the cursor position is (36,15), and the boulder is adjacent north. So after pushing the boulder north, it's now at (36,14), I guess.

Looking at the map, the agent is at (36,15). The fountains are near east and eastsoutheast. The boulder was pushed north, but maybe the goal is to get it to the fountain. The stairs up are adjacent southwest, but that's probably not needed right now.

The language observation mentions a fountain very near east and eastsoutheast. The boulder very near eastsoutheast might be the target. So I need to push the boulder towards that fountain. But right now, the boulder is north of the agent. So after pushing it north, maybe the next step is to move it further north towards the fountain.

Wait, the agent is at (36,15), and the boulder is adjacent north. So to push it further north, the agent needs to move north into the boulder. But the message after the previous north action was that the boulder was moved. So perhaps the agent is now north of where the boulder was, and the boulder is at (36,14). Wait, no, when you push a boulder, you move into it, and it moves in the direction you're pushing. So if the agent was at (36,15) and pushed north, the agent would move to (36,14), and the boulder would also move to (36,14). But that can't be right because then the agent would be on the boulder, which isn't possible. Wait, maybe the agent is now at (36,14), and the boulder was pushed to (36,14) as well. But that would mean the agent is on the boulder, which isn't allowed. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the movement mechanics here.

Alternatively, when you push a boulder, you move into the space where the boulder is, and the boulder moves one space in the direction you're pushing. So if the agent is at (36,15) and the boulder is at (36,14), pushing north would mean the agent moves to (36,14), and the boulder moves to (36,13). That makes more sense. So after the previous north action, the agent is now at (36,14), and the boulder is at (36,13). Then, the next step would be to check if the boulder is now near a fountain. The fountains are near east and eastsoutheast, so maybe the agent needs to move east to get the boulder towards that area.

Looking at the current language observation: ""fountain very near east and eastsoutheast"". So the east direction has a fountain. The boulder is at (36,13), which is north of the agent's current position (36,14). The agent needs to get the boulder to the east. So the path east from the boulder's current position (36,13) might be blocked by bars or other obstacles. The map shows bars in various directions, but the exact layout isn't fully visible here. 

The cursor's position is (36,15) after the previous move, but after pushing the boulder north, the agent's position would be (36,14), and the boulder is at (36,13). Now, the agent needs to decide the next move. Since the goal is to get the boulder to the east fountain, maybe the agent should move east to position themselves near the boulder and then push it further east.

But the agent is at (36,14), and the boulder is at (36,13). To push the boulder east, the agent would need to move east into it. So the agent needs to go from (36,14) to (36,15), then push the boulder east to (36,16). But looking at the map, the east direction from (36,15) might have obstacles. The language observation mentions bars very near northnortheast, northeast, etc., but the specific east direction from (36,15) isn't clear. Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to move south back to the original position to then push the boulder in a different direction.

Wait, the previous actions were a series of north, west, south, etc., trying to navigate around obstacles. After successfully pushing the boulder north once, the next step is to see if that boulder can be moved further towards the fountain. The fountain is east, so perhaps after moving the boulder north, the agent should position themselves to push it east.

But the current agent position is (36,14) after the last north action. To move east, the agent needs to go to (36,15). However, the map's east direction from there might be blocked. The language observation says ""bars very near northnortheast, northeast, southeast, etc."" So maybe moving east is possible if there's no obstacle. The cursor's position is (36,14), and the agent needs to check the nearby bars.

Alternatively, the agent could move south to get back to (36,15) and then try to push the boulder east. Let's consider that. If the agent moves south from (36,14) to (36,15), then they can attempt to push the boulder east. The boulder is at (36,13), so moving east from there would take it to (36,14). But the agent is already at (36,15), so that space might be blocked by something. Wait, the agent was at (36,15) before moving north. After pushing north, the agent is at (36,14), and the boulder is at (36,13). If the agent moves south back to (36,15), they can then try to push the boulder east.

Alternatively, maybe the agent can push the boulder north again, but that might not help. The key is to get the boulder to the east fountain. Let me check the language observation again: ""fountain very near east and eastsoutheast"". So the east direction has a fountain. The boulder is currently at (36,13), which is north of the agent's position (36,14). To get the boulder east, the agent needs to move east towards it.

So the plan is: move the agent east to (36,15), then push the boulder east to (36,16). But before that, check if the path is clear. The language observation mentions ""bars very near northnortheast, northeast, southeast, southsoutheast, south, southsouthwest, southwest, westsouthwest, west, westnorthwest, northwest, and northnorthwest"". So in the immediate vicinity, there are bars in various directions. The agent is at (36,14), and moving east to (36,15) might be possible if there are no bars there. The map shows at (36,15) the character is '@' which is the agent, and the space east (36,16) might be a '.' if it's a floor. But the exact map details are unclear from the provided information.

Alternatively, maybe the agent should first check the surroundings. But the available actions are movement (north, south, east, west). Given that the previous attempts to move north, south, etc., led to pushing the boulder, the next logical step is to try to move the boulder towards the east fountain.

So, after pushing the boulder north to (36,13), the agent is at (36,14). Now, moving east to (36,15) and then pushing the boulder east to (36,16) could be the way. But I need to confirm if that's possible. The language observation doesn't explicitly mention obstacles in the east direction from (36,14), but the presence of bars very near various directions suggests that there might be barriers.

Alternatively, maybe the agent should move south back to (36,15) to reposition. Let's see: if the agent moves south from (36,14) to (36,15), then they can attempt to push the boulder east. The boulder is at (36,13), so moving east from there would take it to (36,14), which is where the agent is now. That wouldn't work because the agent can't be on the boulder. So perhaps the agent needs to move further east.

Wait, no. If the agent is at (36,15) and the boulder is at (36,13), to push the boulder east, the agent would need to move east into the boulder's current position (36,13), which would push the boulder to (36,14). But the agent is already at (36,15), so moving east to (36,16) would be necessary first. Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing.

Let me try to visualize the map based on the cursor position and observations. The agent is at (36,14) after pushing north. The boulder is at (36,13). The fountains are east, so direction east from the boulder's position (36,13) would be towards (36,14) and beyond. But the agent is at (36,14), so moving east from there would be to (36,15). The map's (36,15) is where the agent is, so maybe the boulder needs to be pushed further east from (36,13) to (36,14), then the agent can move east to (36,15) and so on.

But the problem is that the agent is already adjacent to the boulder. So if the agent is at (36,14) and the boulder is at (36,13), the agent is north of the boulder. To push the boulder east, the agent needs to move east into the boulder's position. So the agent would move east to (36,15), which is currently their position (from the cursor data, after the previous move). Wait, no. The cursor position after the last action (north) is (36,15), but that might be a mistake. Let me recheck:

After the previous action (north) which succeeded in moving the boulder, the agent's new position would be where the boulder was before, right? So if the agent was at (36,15) and pushed the boulder north, the agent moves to (36,14), and the boulder moves to (36,13). So the cursor position should be (36,14) now. However, the user's latest observation shows the cursor at (36,15), which might indicate a mistake in the observation data or my understanding.

This confusion makes it harder to determine the exact positions. Assuming that the agent is at (36,14) with the boulder at (36,13), the next step is to get the boulder east to the fountain. So the agent needs to move east to (36,15) and then push the boulder east to (36,16). But is there a barrier in that path?

The language observation mentions bars very near several directions, but specifically, ""bars very near northnortheast, northeast, southeast, southsoutheast, south, southsouthwest, southwest, westsouthwest, west, westnorthwest, northwest, and northnorthwest"". So the immediate east direction from (36,14) (which is where the agent is) might have a bar. If there's a bar to the east, the agent can't push the boulder that way.

Alternatively, maybe the agent should move south back to (36,15) to then push the boulder in a different direction. If the agent moves south to (36,15), they can then try to push the boulder east. The boulder is at (36,13), so moving east from there would take it to (36,14), which is where the agent is now. That's not possible. So perhaps the agent needs to move further east first.

Alternatively, the agent should check the map for the fountain's location. The fountain is very near east, so maybe east of the current agent position. If the agent can push the boulder east past the bars, that would be ideal. But given the presence of bars, the path might be blocked.

Another approach is to look for the stairs up, which are adjacent southwest. Maybe the agent needs to go back up the stairs, but that's probably not necessary yet. The goal is to push the boulder onto the fountain.

Considering all this, the most logical next step is to attempt to push the boulder east. To do that, the agent needs to move east into the boulder's current position. So the agent should move east from (36,14) to (36,15), which is their current position after the previous move? Wait, this is getting too confusing without a clear map. 

Alternatively, based on the latest map provided, the agent's position is (36,15), and the boulder is adjacent north. So the boulder is at (36,14). To push it east, the agent needs to move east into the boulder's position (36,14), which would push the boulder to (36,15). But the agent is already at (36,15), so that's not possible. Therefore, the agent needs to move to (36,14) first, then push east. 

But according to the cursor position, after the last successful north action, the agent is at (36,15), which might mean that the previous reasoning is incorrect. This indicates a possible error in tracking positions based on actions. 

In any case, the immediate goal is to get the boulder onto the fountain. The latest observation shows that the boulder is adjacent north to the agent, who is at (36,15). So the boulder is at (36,14). The fountain is very near east. To move the boulder east, the agent needs to be in a position to push it east. 

The agent is at (36,15). To push the boulder east, the agent needs to move east into the boulder's current position (36,14). But the agent is already at (36,15), so moving east to (36,16) would allow them to push the boulder east from (36,14) to (36,15). But is (36,16) a valid position? The map's east direction from (36,15) might be blocked by bars. 

The language observation mentions ""bars very near northnortheast, northeast, southeast, etc."", which could imply that moving east from (36,15) is blocked. If that's the case, the agent can't push the boulder east directly. 

In that case, the agent might need to move the boulder in another direction, perhaps south or west, to create a path east. But the fountains are east, so moving the boulder away from there isn't ideal. 

Alternatively, the agent could try to move the boulder north again, but that might not help. Another option is to move the agent west to reposition, then push the boulder east. 

Given the uncertainty in the map layout, the safest bet might be to continue pushing the boulder in the direction that seems closest to the fountain. Since the fountain is east, and the current boulder position is north of the agent, perhaps pushing the boulder east from its current position (36,14) to (36,15) is the way to go. 

But to do that, the agent needs to be at (36,14) to push the boulder east. Since the agent is at (36,15), they need to move north to (36,14) first, then push east. However, moving north from (36,15) would take the agent back to where the boulder was, which is now empty. Wait, no. The boulder is at (36,14), so the agent can move north to (36,14) and then push east. 

So the sequence would be: move north to (36,14), then push east. 

But the agent is already at (36,15) according to the cursor position. This is getting too confusing without the actual map layout. 

Given the information available, the best action is to attempt to push the boulder east. To do that, the agent needs to move east into the boulder's current position. Since the boulder is adjacent north, the agent is south of it. To push east, the agent needs to be west of the boulder. 

Wait, the boulder is at (36,14), and the agent is at (36,15). The agent is east of the boulder. To push the boulder east, the agent needs to move east into the boulder's current position. So from (36,15), moving east to (36,16) would allow the agent to push the boulder east from (36,14) to (36,15). But if there's a bar at (36,16), that's not possible. 

Alternatively, the agent can move north to (36,14), which is where the boulder is, but that's not possible because the boulder is there. The agent can't be on the boulder. 

This suggests that the agent needs to move in a different direction. Perhaps moving south to (36,16), then pushing the boulder east. But again, without knowing the map layout, it's hard to say. 

Another possibility is that the agent should move west to create space and then push the boulder east. 

Given the uncertainty, the safest action might be to continue moving the boulder in the last successful direction, which was north. But that might not get it closer to the fountain. 

Alternatively, based on the latest language observation, there's a fountain very near east. The agent is at (36,15), and the boulder is at (36,14). So moving east from (36,15) to (36,16) and then pushing the boulder east from (36,14) to (36,15) could work, but only if there's no barrier at (36,16). 

Since the language observation mentions bars very near various directions, but not specifically in the east from (36,15), it's possible that the path is clear. 

Therefore, the chosen action would be to move east. This allows the agent to position themselves to push the boulder east towards the fountain.

Let's see where I'm at. The goal is to push the boulder onto the fountain. From the current observation, I'm at position (37, 15). The boulder is very near eastsoutheast, and there's a fountain very near east. So the boulder needs to be moved towards the east to reach the fountain.

Looking at the map, I can see some bars and dark areas blocking paths. The stairs up are westsouthwest, but I don't need those right now. The boulder is adjacent to southeast and west. Since I'm at (37,15), moving east would take me towards where the boulder is. But when I tried moving east before, I got a message that I couldn't move the boulder. Maybe I need to position myself correctly to push it.

Wait, the boulder is adjacent southeast and west. So the boulder is probably to the southeast of my current position. If I move east, I might be next to the boulder. But to push it, I need to move in the direction opposite to where I want to push it. For example, if the boulder is to the east, I should push it west by moving east into it. Wait, no. To push a boulder, you have to walk into it from the direction you want to move it. So if the boulder is to the east of me, I need to move east into it to push it west. But in the previous attempts, moving east didn't work. Maybe the boulder is blocked by something else.

Looking at the latest observation after moving north and getting the message about moving the boulder, the boulder is very near eastsoutheast. So perhaps the boulder is in a spot that's not directly east but more to the southeast. Maybe I need to approach it from the right angle. Let me check the map again.

The cursor position is (37,15), and the boulder is very near eastsoutheast. So the boulder is probably at (38,16) or similar. To push it towards the fountain at east, which is near eastsoutheast, I need to get behind the boulder. If I move east to (38,15), maybe I can then move southeast to push it further east. But earlier attempts to move east resulted in the message ""You cannot pass through the bars."" Wait, but in the last observation, when I moved north after being at (38,15), I got a message that I moved the boulder. That suggests that maybe after moving north, I was able to push it.

Wait, in the observation where the message was ""With great effort you move the boulder,"" the agent was at (36,15) after moving north. The boulder was adjacent north there. So perhaps pushing the boulder northward moved it closer to the fountain. But the fountain is to the east. Maybe I need to push the boulder eastward now.

Looking at the current observation, the boulder is adjacent southeast and northwest. So the boulder is probably at (38,16), with the agent at (37,15). To push the boulder southeast, the agent would need to move southeast into it. But the agent's current position is (37,15). Moving southeast would take them to (38,16), which is where the boulder is. So by moving southeast, they would push the boulder to (39,17), which might be towards the fountain.

Alternatively, since the fountain is very near east, maybe pushing the boulder east first. But to do that, the agent needs to be adjacent to the boulder's eastern side. If the boulder is at (38,16), then the agent needs to be at (38,15) to push it east to (39,16). But the agent is currently at (37,15). Moving east to (38,15) might allow them to push the boulder east.

Wait, but in the previous steps, moving east from (37,15) didn't work because of bars. But maybe now the bars have moved? Let me check the language observations. The bars adjacent north and northeast at (37,15). So moving north or northeast would hit bars. Moving east is possible if there's no barrier. But the message when trying to move east before was ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain,"" which suggests that the boulder is blocked or the path is clear but the boulder can't be moved that way.

Alternatively, maybe the boulder is blocked by another obstacle. The latest map shows at position (38,15) there's a `<` which might be the agent, and the boulder is at (38,16) with `{`. So the agent is at (37,15), looking east to (38,15), which is a wall (since the map has `#` for walls). Wait, looking at the map:

The map line for y=15 is:
#`..@.{.`.# 

So at x=37, y=15 is the agent's position (`@`). To the east (x=38, y=15) is a backtick `` which might be a floor or another feature, but not a wall. Then at x=38, y=16 is the boulder (`{`). So the path from (37,15) east to (38,15) is clear, and then from (38,15) southeast to (39,16) where the boulder is. So to push the boulder east, the agent needs to move east to (38,15), then southeast to push it to (39,16).

But when the agent tried moving east before, they got a message about the boulder. Maybe they were not adjacent to the boulder. Let me check the previous steps. After moving north from (38,15) to (38,14), then north again to (38,13), but that might not be relevant.

In the current state, the agent is at (37,15). To get to the boulder at (38,16), they need to move east to (38,15), then southeast to (38,16), then push it east to (39,16). But the agent needs to be adjacent to the boulder to push it. So moving east to (38,15) would make them adjacent to the boulder's northwest side. Then moving southeast into the boulder's position would push it east.

So the sequence should be: move east to (38,15), then move southeast to push the boulder to (39,16). Then repeat to get it closer to the fountain at east.

Alternatively, if moving directly southeast from (37,15) is possible. From (37,15), moving southeast would take to (38,16), which is the boulder's position. So moving southeast directly into the boulder would push it to (39,17). But the fountain is at east, so (39,17) might be closer.

But I need to check if the path is clear. The bars are adjacent north and northeast at (37,15), so moving north or northeast is blocked. Moving south is possible, but the latest observation after moving south didn't change anything. Moving east to (38,15) seems clear based on the map. Then moving southeast into the boulder.

So the next action should be southeast to push the boulder eastwards towards the fountain.

Let's try to figure out what the agent should do here. The goal is to push the boulder onto the fountain. Looking at the observations, the boulder is very near eastsoutheast. The agent is currently at (37,15). The map shows some bars and dark areas around, so movement is restricted.

Previously, the agent tried moving south multiple times but kept getting a message that they couldn't move the boulder. Maybe they tried pushing the boulder when there's something blocking its path. The latest observation after moving east shows the boulder adjacent southeast and northwest. So the boulder is probably to the southeast of the agent.

The agent's current position is (37,15). If the boulder is southeast, moving southeast would take the agent to (38,16). But the problem is there might be obstacles. The language observation mentions bars adjacent north and northeast, and a boulder adjacent southeast and northwest. Wait, the boulder is adjacent southeast and northwest of the agent? That might mean the boulder is positioned such that from the agent's current location, moving southeast would push the boulder further southeast towards the fountain.

But the message when trying to push before said ""in vain,"" which could mean the boulder is blocked. Wait, looking back, the agent tried south and kept getting the message. Maybe the boulder is against a wall or another obstacle. Alternatively, the agent might not be facing the correct direction to push it.

The map shows that at position (37,15), there's a `<` which is the stairs up. The boulder is very near eastsoutheast. The fountain is adjacent east. So maybe the boulder needs to be moved from its current position towards the fountain. The agent needs to get into a position where they can push the boulder towards the fountain.

Looking at the current cursor position (37,15), moving east would take them to (38,15), which has a boulder very near there. But when the agent moved east before, they got a message about the boulder, but the observation didn't change. Maybe the boulder is stuck because there's something behind it. Alternatively, the agent needs to push the boulder in a direction that's not blocked.

The key is to find a direction where the boulder can be moved towards the fountain. The fountain is adjacent east, so pushing the boulder east into the fountain would solve the problem. The agent needs to be next to the boulder and push it east. From the current position (37,15), the boulder is adjacent southeast and northwest. Wait, maybe the boulder is positioned at (38,16) or similar. If the agent moves southeast, they might be able to push it east.

Alternatively, perhaps the agent should move to the east of the current position and then push the boulder south or southeast. But given the barriers, the safest bet is to check the directions again. The latest observation after moving west shows the boulder adjacent southeast and northwest of the agent. So if the agent is at (36,16), moving southeast would take them to (37,17), but that might not be the case. Wait, the cursor position after moving west was (36,16). Then moving east got them back to (37,15). The boulder is adjacent southeast and northwest of the agent at (37,15). So the boulder could be at (38,16) (southeast) and (36,14) (northwest), but that seems unlikely. Maybe the boulder is at (38,15) (southeast) and (36,16) (northwest). Wait, the boulder adjacent southeast would be to the southeast of the agent's current position, which is (37,15). So southeast direction is (38,16). If the agent moves east to (38,15), then they can try pushing the boulder south or east.

But in the previous steps, moving south from (37,15) resulted in a message that the boulder couldn't be moved. Maybe the boulder is blocked by bars or another obstacle. The agent needs to position themselves such that pushing the boulder will move it towards the fountain. The fountain is very near east, so pushing the boulder east into the fountain would be ideal. To do that, the agent needs to be next to the boulder on the west side and push it east.

Given the current position (37,15), the boulder is adjacent southeast. So perhaps the boulder is at (38,16). The agent is at (37,15). To push the boulder east, the agent would need to move to (38,15) (east) and then push south or east. But the map shows that at (38,15), there's a `<` (stairs up) which might be an obstacle. Alternatively, maybe the agent should move southeast to (38,16) and then push east into the fountain.

Wait, but the agent's current position is (37,15). Moving southeast would take them to (38,16). If the boulder is at (38,16), then pushing it east would take it to (39,16), where the fountain is very near eastsoutheast. That might work. So the sequence would be: move southeast to (38,16), then push east into the fountain.

But the previous attempts to move south resulted in not being able to move the boulder. Maybe because the agent wasn't adjacent to the boulder. Let's check the latest observation after moving east to (37,15). The boulder is adjacent southeast and northwest. So the boulder could be at (38,15) (southeast of agent's position) and (36,15) (northwest). If the boulder is at (38,15), then the agent can move east to (38,15) and push south or east. But the map at (38,15) has a `<` which is stairs up. So maybe the boulder is not there. Alternatively, the boulder is at (38,16), which is southeast of (37,15). In that case, moving southeast to (38,16) and then pushing east into the fountain.

Another possibility is that the agent needs to move the boulder south towards the fountain. If the fountain is at eastsoutheast, maybe the boulder needs to be moved south first. But without seeing the exact map layout, it's a bit tricky. The agent's map shows a lot of ########## which are probably walls or bars.

Given the constraints, the best bet is to try pushing the boulder in a direction that leads it towards the fountain. Since the fountain is adjacent east, pushing the boulder east would be ideal. To do that, the agent needs to be west of the boulder. If the boulder is at (38,15), then the agent can move east to (38,15) and push east. But if there's a stair or bar there, that won't work. Alternatively, if the boulder is at (38,16), moving southeast and then pushing east.

Considering the previous actions and the messages, the agent tried moving south and couldn't push the boulder. Maybe because they weren't aligned correctly. The correct action now would be to move southeast to get next to the boulder and then push east. So the chosen action should be southeast, then push east. But since the agent can only move one step at a time, first move southeast to (38,16), then push east.

But the available actions are only the directions: north, east, south, west. So the agent needs to move to the adjacent square to the boulder. Based on the latest observation, the boulder is adjacent southeast. So moving southeast would place the agent next to the boulder, allowing them to push it east into the fountain. Therefore, the next action should be southeast.

Let's see where I am. I'm a knight in Boxoban, trying to push boulders onto fountains. The current position is (37,15). The map shows a bunch of bars around, which I can't pass through. There's a boulder at eastsoutheast and a fountain nearby. My goal is to move the boulder onto the fountain.

Looking at the observations, the previous actions were south, east, south, etc., but they failed because the boulder couldn't be moved or there were bars blocking. The last valid action was north, which the system defaulted to because my previous response was invalid. After moving north, the message said ""You cannot pass through the bars,"" so that's why I'm back at (37,15).

The boulder is adjacent to southeast and northwest. The fountain is adjacent east. So maybe I need to position myself to push the boulder from the northwest direction. Wait, the boulder is at eastsoutheast, so if I'm at (37,15), pushing it east or southeast might be possible if there's space. But the language observation mentions bars adjacent north and northeast. Also, stairs up are near westsouthwest, so maybe moving west isn't helpful right now.

Alternatively, maybe I need to go around the bars to get to a position where I can push the boulder. Let me check the map again. The map shows some structure with '#', which are probably walls or bars. The agent is at a position with a boulder to the southeast. The fountain is very near east, so the boulder needs to be moved east onto the fountain.

If I move east from (37,15), I reach (38,15). Let me check if that's possible. The previous attempt to move south resulted in a message that trying to move the boulder failed. Maybe the boulder is stuck because there's a bar behind it. Wait, the boulder is adjacent southeast and northwest. So if the boulder is at (38,16), then moving it southeast would require the space behind it to be empty. But if there's a bar there, I can't push it.

Alternatively, maybe I need to move the agent to the northwest of the boulder to push it north or west. The boulder is at eastsoutheast, so the agent is east of it. If I move west to (36,15), then I can try to push the boulder from the west. But the bars adjacent north and northeast might block that path. Hmm.

Looking at the cursor position after moving north, the agent is back at (37,15). The boulder is very near eastsoutheast. So the boulder is probably at (38,16) or similar. To push it east onto the fountain, the agent needs to be positioned to the west of the boulder. If the boulder is at (38,16), then the agent needs to be at (38,15) to push it east. But the agent is at (37,15), so moving east to (38,15) would allow pushing the boulder east to (39,15), which is the fountain.

But the previous attempts to move south or east resulted in failure. Maybe there's a bar blocking the path. The language observation says bars adjacent north and northeast. So from (38,15), moving north would hit a bar, but moving east could be possible if the path is clear. Wait, the boulder is at (38,16), so if the agent moves east to (38,15), then pushes the boulder east to (39,15), which is the fountain.

But why did previous attempts fail? Maybe the agent wasn't in the correct position. Let's try moving east again to (38,15), then push the boulder east. The message ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain"" suggests that either the agent isn't next to the boulder or there's an obstacle behind it.

Looking at the map, the agent is at (37,15). The boulder is very near eastsoutheast, which would be (38,16) or (39,15). If the agent moves east to (38,15), then they are adjacent to the boulder at (38,16). Then pushing it east would require the space at (39,16) to be empty. But if there's a bar there, it can't be moved. The language observation mentions bars very near north, northnortheast, etc., but doesn't specify the exact position.

Alternatively, maybe the correct action is to move south to (37,16) and then try to push the boulder southeast. But the agent was previously at (37,16) and moving south didn't work. The message after moving south was ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain,"" which might mean the boulder is blocked by a bar behind it.

Another approach: check the adjacency of the boulder. The boulder is adjacent southeast and northwest. So if the boulder is at (38,16), then northwest would be (37,15), which is where the agent is. Wait, that can't be. If the boulder is at (38,16), then northwest would be (37,15), which is the agent's current position. That would mean the agent is next to the boulder's northwest side. In that case, pushing the boulder northwest would require the space at (36,15) to be empty. But according to the language observation, bars are adjacent north and northeast of the agent's current position. So moving the boulder northwest (to (36,16)) might be blocked by a bar.

Alternatively, if the boulder is at (38,15), then adjacent southeast would be (39,16), and northwest would be (37,14). But the agent is at (37,15), so pushing the boulder north from there would require the space at (38,14) to be empty. Not sure.

This is getting a bit confusing. Let's recap:

- Agent is at (37,15).
- Boulder is adjacent southeast and northwest.
- Fountain is adjacent east.
- Bars are blocking certain directions.

If the boulder is to the southeast of the agent, then the agent needs to be to the west of the boulder to push it east. So moving east to (38,15) would position the agent next to the boulder's west side. Then pushing east should work if the path is clear. But previous attempts to move east resulted in failure, perhaps because the boulder is blocked by a bar behind it.

Alternatively, maybe the boulder is blocked by a bar, so the agent can't push it. In that case, the agent needs to find another way to move the boulder by going around the bars.

Another possibility: the stairs up are near westsouthwest, which is (35,14) maybe. But moving west from (37,15) to (36,15) was previously done, but didn't help. The agent tried west and then north, but that didn't resolve the issue.

Wait, in the last valid action, after moving north, the agent's position is (37,15), same as before. The message was ""You cannot pass through the bars,"" which means the north direction was blocked by bars. So the agent is back at the starting point.

Given all this, the best next move is likely to try pushing the boulder again from the correct position. Since the boulder is adjacent southeast and northwest, and the agent is at (37,15), which would be the northwest of the boulder if the boulder is at (38,16). So pushing the boulder east towards the fountain at (39,15) would require moving the agent to (38,15) first. But the agent is at (37,15), so moving east to (38,15) and then pushing east.

But earlier attempts to move east resulted in failure. Maybe there's a bar at (38,15), preventing the agent from moving there. The language observation says bars very near north, northnortheast, etc., but not specifically at (38,15).

Alternatively, perhaps the agent needs to move south to (37,16) and then try to push the boulder southeast. Let's try that. Move south from (37,15) to (37,16). Then, if the boulder is at (38,16), pushing it southeast would take it to (39,17), which might not be the fountain. The fountain is at east, so (39,15) perhaps.

This is getting complicated. Maybe the best approach is to keep trying to move east to get next to the boulder and then push it. Even if previous attempts failed, maybe the bars are temporarily not blocking, or there's a different configuration.

So, the next action should be east to (38,15), then push the boulder east. But since the agent can't push while not adjacent, first move east, then push. But the previous attempt to move east resulted in ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain,"" which might mean the agent isn't next to the boulder. Wait, if the agent is at (37,15) and moves east to (38,15), and the boulder is at (38,16), then the agent is adjacent to the boulder's north side. So pushing the boulder south into (38,15) might not be the goal. The fountain is east, so pushing the boulder east to (39,16).

But maybe the correct direction is southeast. If the agent moves south to (37,16), then they are adjacent to the boulder's west side (if the boulder is at (38,16)), and can push it southeast to (39,17). Not sure if that's the fountain.

Alternatively, the fountain is at eastsoutheast, which would be (38,16) if the agent is at (37,15). So the boulder needs to be moved to (38,16) to be on the fountain. But the boulder is already there? No, the boulder is near eastsoutheast, so maybe it's at (38,16), and the fountain is at (38,15). Then the agent needs to push the boulder west into (38,15).

Wait, the fountain is adjacent east, so if the agent is at (37,15), east is (38,15). So the fountain is at (38,15). The boulder is at eastsoutheast, which would be (38,16). So to push the boulder onto the fountain at (38,15), the agent needs to push it west into (38,15). That would require the agent to be at (38,16) and push west. But the agent is at (37,15). So the agent needs to move to (38,16) and then push west.

But how to get there? The agent is at (37,15). To get to (38,16), the agent would need to move east then south, but there might be bars blocking. Alternatively, move south to (37,16), then east to (38,16). But the previous attempts to move south resulted in ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain,"" which might be because the agent wasn't next to the boulder.

This is quite challenging. Given the previous attempts and the current position, the most logical next step is to try moving east to (38,15) and then push the boulder east. If that's blocked, then try a different direction. Since the agent is stuck, maybe moving west to find a way around the bars could help. But moving west to (36,15) might not help unless there's a path there.

Alternatively, check if the boulder can be pushed north. If the agent moves north to (37,14), but there are bars adjacent north, so that's not possible.

Given the time I've spent and the previous failures, I'll go with moving east to (38,15) again, hoping that maybe the bars aren't there, and then push the boulder east onto the fountain.

Let's try to figure out the best move here. The agent is in a Boxoban-like level, needing to push boulders onto fountains. The current position is (38,15). Let's look at the observations.

Previous actions had the agent moving south multiple times but failing because they were trying to push a boulder when there's something blocking the way. The last valid action was moving east, which got the agent to (38,15). Now, the map shows a boulder adjacent to the southeast and south. The cursor is on @, and the boulder is at <. The fountain is adjacent to the east, which is a good target.

The agent needs to push the boulder towards the fountain. Since the boulder is to the southeast and south, maybe moving south again would allow pushing it. But earlier attempts to move south resulted in ""in vain"" messages, possibly because the boulder was blocked or the agent wasn't positioned correctly. Wait, looking at the map, after moving east to (38,15), the boulder is adjacent southeast and south. So if the agent moves south, they might be able to push the boulder south into the fountain.

Wait, the boulder is at (37,15) perhaps? Let me check the map. The map shows:

At line 8: #...@{.`.# (the agent is at position 8 in the line, assuming each # is a step). Then line 9: #<..``{.{# which has the boulder (<) at position 3. So the agent is at (38,15), and the boulder is at (37,15) to the west. Wait, maybe I'm getting coordinates mixed up. The cursor is (x=38, y=15). The boulder adjacent southeast and south. So the boulder could be to the southeast (south-east) or directly south. If the agent is at (38,15), moving south would take them to (38,16). If the boulder is south of the agent, then moving south would allow pushing it further. But the message said ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain"" when moving south before. Maybe because the boulder is already pushed as far as it can go, or there's another obstacle.

Looking at the latest map, after moving east to (38,15), the boulder is adjacent southeast and south. The fountain is adjacent east. So maybe pushing the boulder to the south into the fountain. Let's check the surrounding tiles. South of the agent (38,15) is (38,16), which has a boulder (`<` at (38,16)? No, looking at the map line 9: #<..``{.{#. So the < is at position 3 in line 9. Wait, maybe the coordinates are such that each character is a tile. The agent is at (38,15), which is the position of @. The boulder to the southeast would be at (39,16), but the map line 9 is #<..``{.{#, so the < is at position 3 (assuming the first character is x=37, y=15). So the boulder is at (37,15) which is to the west of the agent. Then adjacent southeast and south would be different positions. Maybe I need to re-express the map coordinates correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the boulder is near the southeast direction from the agent's position. Since the agent is at (38,15), moving southeast would be to (39,16). But the fountain is adjacent east, which is (39,15). So if the boulder is between the agent and the fountain, pushing it east into the fountain would solve the problem. But the current boulder positions are adjacent southeast and south. Maybe the agent needs to move in a direction that allows pushing the boulder towards the fountain.

Alternatively, the agent could move south to get next to the boulder and then push it east. But if moving south from (38,15) takes them to (38,16), which is a boulder, then they can't move there. Wait, the message when moving south before was ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain"" which means the agent tried to move into the boulder, not push it. So perhaps the agent needs to position themselves next to the boulder and then push.

Looking at the current map, the agent is at (38,15). The boulder is adjacent southeast and south. So if the boulder is to the southeast (38,16), then the agent could move east to (39,15) which is the fountain, but there's a boulder adjacent southeast. Alternatively, the agent might need to move south to (38,16) and then push the boulder east into the fountain at (39,15). But earlier attempts to move south resulted in failure. Maybe because there's another obstacle.

Looking at the language observation: ""bars adjacent north, northeast, and northwest"". So the agent is next to bars in those directions, meaning they can't move north, northeast, or northwest. Therefore, movement options are limited to south, east, west, and southeast/southwest if possible.

The agent's inventory has a +1 long sword and a lance, but pushing a boulder doesn't require attacking. The key is to move the boulder onto the fountain. The fountain is adjacent east, so the goal is to get the boulder to (39,15).

The boulder is currently adjacent southeast and south. If the agent moves east to (39,15), which is the fountain, but there's a boulder adjacent southeast. Wait, the boulder is at (38,16) (southeast of agent's current position?), so moving east from (38,15) to (39,15) is the fountain. But the boulder is at (38,16), so to push it east, the agent would need to move south to (38,16) first, then push east into (39,16), but the fountain is at (39,15). Hmm, maybe the boulder needs to be moved to (39,15).

Alternatively, maybe the boulder is at (37,16) (south of agent's position at (38,15)), and the agent can push it east into (38,16), but that's not the fountain. The fountain is at (39,15). So perhaps the correct path is to move the boulder to (39,15). To do that, the agent needs to position themselves next to the boulder and push it east.

Given the current position and boulder locations, the agent should move south to get next to the boulder, then push east into the fountain. However, previous attempts to move south resulted in ""in vain"" messages. That might be because there's an obstacle behind the boulder. The language observation mentions ""boulder adjacent southeast and south"", so the boulder could be at (38,16) (south) and (39,16) (southeast). If the agent moves south to (38,16), which is the boulder's position, then they can't move further. Instead, they need to move in a direction that allows pushing.

Alternatively, the agent can move east to (39,15), the fountain, but there's a boulder adjacent southeast. Wait, maybe the boulder is at (39,16), and the agent can push it south into (39,15), which is the fountain. But how to reach there.

Another approach: the agent is at (38,15). The boulder is adjacent southeast and south. Suppose the boulder is at (38,16) (south) and (39,16) (southeast). To push the boulder east into the fountain at (39,15), the agent needs to be to the west of the boulder. So the agent should move south to (38,16), then push east into (39,16), but that's not the fountain. Then from (39,16), push south into (39,15), which is the fountain. But that requires two pushes, and the agent must be positioned correctly.

Alternatively, maybe the boulder is at (39,15), but the observation says it's adjacent southeast and south. So perhaps the agent needs to move southeast to get next to the boulder. But the bars are adjacent north, northeast, and northwest, so moving south, east, or southwest might be possible.

Given the constraints, the best action might be to move south to get next to the boulder and then push east. However, previous attempts failed, so maybe the agent needs to check the exact position of the boulder and fountain.

Alternatively, since the fountain is adjacent east, perhaps the agent should move east to the fountain and push the boulder from there. But the boulder is to the southeast, so the agent might need to move southeast first.

Wait, the agent's current position is (38,15). The boulder is adjacent southeast and south. So southeast would be (39,16), and south is (38,16). If the boulder is at (38,16), then the agent can move south to (38,16) and then push east into (39,16), but that's not the fountain. The fountain is at (39,15). So to get the boulder to (39,15), the agent would need to push it south into (39,15) from (39,16), which requires being at (39,16) and pushing south. But how to get there.

Alternatively, the agent can move east to (39,15), the fountain, and then if there's a boulder adjacent, push it west into the fountain. But the boulder is to the southeast, so maybe not.

This is a bit confusing. Let's recap:

- Agent at (38,15)
- Boulder adjacent southeast and south
- Fountain adjacent east (39,15)
- Bars blocking north, northeast, northwest

Possible moves: south, east, west, or maybe southeast/southwest if possible.

If the agent moves east to (39,15), the fountain, but there's a boulder adjacent southeast. If the boulder is at (39,16), then pushing it south into (39,15) would solve it. So the agent needs to move to (39,16) and push south.

To get to (39,16), the agent can move east to (39,15) (fountain), then south to (39,16). But is that possible? Let's see:

1. Move east to (39,15) -> valid, since fountain is there.
2. Move south to (39,16) -> there's a boulder at (39,16), so the agent can push it by moving into it while having space behind.

But the message when trying to move south before was ""in vain"" because the agent wasn't next to the boulder. So the correct sequence would be:

- Move east to (39,15) (fountain)
- Then move south to (39,16), which is the boulder, and push it by moving into it, provided there's space behind (south of (39,16) is (39,17), which might be a valid space).

If that's the case, then the agent should move east to (39,15), then south to push the boulder into the fountain.

But according to the current map, the agent's position is (38,15), and moving east would take them to (39,15), which is the fountain. The boulder is adjacent southeast and south. If the boulder is at (39,16), then moving east to (39,15), then south to (39,16) (the boulder), then pushing it south into (39,15) (fountain) would work.

However, the latest observation shows that after moving east to (38,15), the boulder is adjacent southeast and south. So maybe the boulder is at (39,16) (southeast of agent) and (38,16) (south). To push the boulder at (39,16) into the fountain at (39,15), the agent needs to be at (39,15) and push it west. But the boulder is to the east of the fountain.

Alternatively, the agent should move south to (38,16), where the boulder is, then push it east into (39,16), then from there push south into (39,15). But that requires two pushes, and the agent must have space behind each boulder position.

Given the current state, the best immediate action is to move east to (39,15) to get next to the boulder and then push it west into the fountain. But how to confirm the boulder's position.

Alternatively, since the agent can't move north, northeast, or northwest, the only options are south, east, west, or perhaps southeast/southwest if possible. The agent should try to move towards the boulder and push it towards the fountain.

Given the latest map, after moving east to (38,15), the boulder is adjacent southeast and south. So moving south to (38,16) would place the agent next to the boulder, allowing a push east into (39,16). Then from there, push south into (39,15), the fountain. But the agent needs to check if those spaces are clear.

The language observation mentions ""fountain very near eastsoutheast and westnorthwest"". The eastsoutheast would be (40,16), so maybe not directly relevant. The fountain adjacent east is (39,15).

So the step-by-step plan:

1. Move south from (38,15) to (38,16) to reach the boulder.
2. Push the boulder east to (39,16).
3. From (39,16), push the boulder south to (39,15), the fountain.

But in the current observation, after moving east to (38,15), the boulder is adjacent southeast and south. So moving south to (38,16) would be adjacent to the boulder, allowing a push east.

The problem is that previous attempts to move south resulted in failure. Maybe because there was an obstacle behind the boulder. The latest language observation says ""boulder very near westnorthwest"", so maybe the boulder at (38,16) is blocked from moving further south.

Alternatively, maybe the agent should try pushing the boulder east first. If the agent is at (38,15) and the boulder is to the southeast (39,16), the agent can move east to (39,15), then push the boulder west into (38,15), but that's where the agent is.

This is getting a bit tangled. Given the constraints, the best immediate action is likely to move south to get next to the boulder and attempt to push it east. However, since previous attempts failed, perhaps the correct action is to move east to the fountain and then push the boulder from there.

Given the available actions and the need to avoid repeating the same actions without change, the next step is to move east to (39,15) and then push the boulder west into the fountain. But the agent needs to be adjacent to the boulder to push it.

Alternatively, move southeast to get next to the boulder. But the agent's allowed actions are north, east, south, west. Southeast isn't listed, but maybe the directions are limited to the four cardinal directions.

Given the available actions, the best choice is to move east to (39,15), the fountain, and then push the boulder west into it. So the action should be east.

Let's see. The agent is in a Boxoban-like game trying to push boulders onto fountains. The current position is (39, 15). The inventory has some items, but I don't think they're relevant right now since the main goal is moving the boulder.

Looking at the observations, there's a boulder adjacent to the southeast and south. The fountain is adjacent to the southeast. So the goal is to push the boulder onto the fountain. The agent is at (39,15), and the boulder is to the southeast. 

The problem is that the agent is trying to move south or east but hitting bars or walls. The previous attempts to move south resulted in ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain,"" which probably means there's something blocking the path. Wait, the bars adjacent north, northeast, and northwest might be blocking movement north. But the agent is trying to go south towards the boulder.

Wait, the cursor position is (39,15), and the boulder is adjacent southeast and south. So to reach the boulder, the agent needs to move either east or south. But when the agent tried moving south before, it failed. Let me check the map again. The map shows the agent's position with `<` at (38,15) initially, but now it's at (39,15) after moving east. The boulder is very near east, so maybe it's at (39,15) east? Or perhaps the boulder is further south.

Looking at the language observation: ""boulder very near east"" when the agent is at (38,15), then after moving east to (39,15), the boulder is very near east again. Wait, maybe the boulder is at (39,16)? Because when the agent moved south to (37,16), the boulder was adjacent southeast and south. So perhaps the boulder is diagonally southeast from the agent's current position.

But the agent needs to get into a position to push the boulder. To push a boulder, the agent has to move into it, and there must be an empty space behind it. The current message says ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain,"" which implies that when the agent tried to push it, there's an obstacle behind the boulder. So the path behind the boulder is blocked by bars or walls.

The latest observation shows the boulder adjacent southeast and south. The agent is at (39,15). So if the boulder is to the southeast, that would be (40,16). To push it onto the fountain (which is adjacent southeast), the agent needs to position itself next to the boulder. Maybe the agent should move east again to get next to the boulder. But when the agent tried moving east before, it might have been blocked by bars.

Looking at the latest map, the agent is at (39,15) with `<` symbol. The map line for y=15 is ""#....@.`.#"", so the agent is at position 39 (assuming the map's left is x=0). The boulder is very near east, so maybe at x=40, y=15. But the bars adjacent north, northeast, and northwest could be blocking movement north. However, the agent needs to move south or east.

Wait, the latest language observation says ""bars adjacent north, northeast, and northwest"" at the agent's position. So moving north would hit bars. The agent is at (39,15). To reach the boulder to the southeast, the agent should move east first to (40,15), then south to (40,16). But if moving east is blocked, that's a problem.

The inventory shows a +1 long sword and lance, but maybe not useful here. The agent needs to navigate around the bars. The stairs up are near westsouthwest, which is probably not helpful right now. The key is to get the boulder onto the fountain adjacent southeast.

So the plan is: move east to get next to the boulder, then move south to push it towards the fountain. But if moving east is blocked by bars, the agent needs to find another path. Alternatively, maybe the agent can move south first, then east. But previous attempts to move south resulted in failure, possibly because the boulder is in the way or there's a barrier.

Wait, the message when moving south previously was ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain,"" which suggests that the agent was trying to push the boulder south, but there's something blocking the path behind it. So the boulder is south of the agent, but the space behind it is blocked, making it impossible to push further.

In the current observation, the boulder is adjacent southeast and south. So the boulder is at (39,16) or (40,15). The fountain is adjacent southeast, which would be at (40,16). To push the boulder onto the fountain, the agent needs to position it there. If the boulder is at (40,15), then moving the agent to (39,15) south of the boulder (but that's where the agent is), then pushing south would require the space behind the boulder to be free. But if the space behind the boulder is blocked by bars, as per the adjacent north, northeast, and northwest bars, maybe the boulder can't be pushed further.

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to move east to (40,15) and then push the boulder south to (40,16), which is the fountain. But to do that, the agent must be adjacent to the boulder. If moving east is possible, then that's the way to go.

Looking at the latest cursor position (39,15) and the boulder very near east, perhaps moving east once gets the agent next to the boulder. Then, moving south to push it onto the fountain. Let's check the map again. The agent's position is marked with `<` at (39,15), and the map line is ""#....@.`.#"", which might mean that moving east from (39,15) would go to (40,15), which is a `.` (floor), so possible. Then, from (40,15), moving south to (40,16), which is the boulder's position? Or is the boulder at (40,15)?

The language observation says ""boulder very near east"" when the agent is at (39,15), so the boulder is at (40,15). Then, to push it south to (40,16), which is the fountain. So the agent needs to move east to (40,15), then move south to push the boulder to (40,16).

But when the agent tried moving east before, it worked and got to (38,16), then further east to (39,15). Now, at (39,15), moving east again should take the agent to (40,15), which is a floor. Then, from there, moving south would allow pushing the boulder.

So the next action should be east to get next to the boulder, then south to push it onto the fountain. But the agent must first move east. Let's confirm the current position and possible moves.

Current position: (39,15). Moving east to (40,15). The map shows that at y=15, the agent's line is ""#....@.`.#"". Assuming each `.` is a floor, then moving east is possible. Once there, the boulder is at (40,15), and moving south from (40,15) would push the boulder to (40,16), which is the fountain. That should solve the puzzle.

",-0.001,False
27,south,"<reasoning>
I need to figure out how to push a boulder into a fountain in this Boxoban-like game. Let me start by looking at the current observation.

The agent is at position (40, 15). Let's check the map. The map shows some bars and dark areas around, but the important stuff is the boulder and the fountain. From the language observation, there's a boulder very near westsouthwest and adjacent east and southwest. Also, the fountain is adjacent south and west. 

So the boulder is to the west of the agent's current position, and the fountain is to the south and west. The agent is at (40,15), and the boulder is at westsouthwest, which is probably west or southwest. Let me see: the cursor shows the agent's position, and the map has a '<' symbol which indicates the agent facing a certain direction. In the latest map, the agent is facing east because the '<' is in the east direction relative to the '@' symbol. Wait, the map shows:

#....{@`.#  
#<..``{.{#  

So the '@' is at position (38,15) initially, but after moving east, now the agent is at (40,15). The '<' in the second line would mean the agent is facing west? Wait, maybe the map's orientation is different. Let me check the cursor's position again. The agent is at (40,15), and the '<' is in the second line, eighth position. So maybe the agent is facing east, but the '<' represents the direction they are facing. Maybe in the game's rendering, the '<' means facing west. This can be confusing. 

Alternatively, perhaps the agent is at (40,15) and the boulder is to the west (position 39,15). The fountain is adjacent to the agent's current position south and west. So the fountain is at (40,16) or (39,15). Let me check the language observation again: ""fountain adjacent south and west"". The agent is at (40,15), so south would be (40,16), and west would be (39,15). So the fountain is at both positions? Or perhaps two fountains? The message says ""fountain very near eastsoutheast and westnorthwest"", but in the current observation, it's adjacent south and west. 

The boulder is adjacent east and southwest. The agent is at (40,15). East would be (41,15), southwest would be (39,14) or (40,14). Wait, the boulder is adjacent east and southwest. So the boulder is either at (41,15) or (39,14) or (40,14). But according to the language observation, the boulder is very near westsouthwest, which would be more to the west. So maybe the boulder is at (39,15), which is southwest of the agent's current position. 

If the boulder is at (39,15), and the agent is at (40,15), then the agent is east of the boulder. To push the boulder into the fountain, the agent needs to move west towards the boulder, push it, and then guide it to the fountain. 

But the current position of the boulder is adjacent east and southwest. If the agent is at (40,15), then the boulder is either to the west (39,15) or southwest (39,14). If the boulder is at (39,15), then the agent can move west to get next to it. Then, by pushing west, the boulder would move to (38,15), but I need to check if there's a fountain there. The fountain is adjacent south and west, which would be (40,16) and (39,15). So if the boulder is at (39,15), pushing it west to (38,15) would place it next to the fountain at (39,15), but the fountain is at (39,15)? That doesn't make sense. Wait, the fountain is adjacent south and west of the agent's position. So the fountain is at (40,16) and (39,15). If the boulder is at (39,15), pushing it west to (38,15) would take it away from the fountain at (39,15). Hmm, maybe the agent needs to push the boulder south into the fountain at (40,16). 

But how? The agent is at (40,15). The boulder is at (39,15). To push the boulder south, the agent needs to be north of it. So first, move west to (39,15), then push south into (39,16). But the fountain is at (40,16). So that's not directly into the fountain. Alternatively, maybe the boulder needs to be pushed to (39,16), then the agent can move it further south to (39,17), but there might be obstacles. 

Alternatively, if the boulder is at (39,14) (southwest of the agent), then pushing it east into (40,14) might not help. This is getting a bit confusing. Let me re-examine the language observation:

""boulder adjacent east and southwest""

The agent is at (40,15). East would be (41,15), southwest would be (40,14) or (39,15). So the boulder is either at (41,15) or (39,15) or (40,14). But ""very near westsouthwest"" suggests it's towards the west, so likely (39,15). 

If the boulder is at (39,15), adjacent to the agent's east, then the agent is west of the boulder. To push it, the agent needs to be north, south, east, or west of the boulder. Since the boulder is east of the agent, the agent needs to move west to be next to the boulder, then push west. But pushing west would move the boulder to (38,15), which is next to the fountain at (39,15). Wait, the fountain is at (39,15) and (40,16). So if the boulder is pushed to (38,15), it's adjacent to the fountain at (39,15), but not on it. The goal is to have the boulder on the fountain. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to push the boulder south into (39,16), which is then adjacent to the fountain at (40,16). That might not be directly onto the fountain. Alternatively, perhaps there's another fountain. 

Looking at the latest map:

In the agent's current position (40,15), the map shows:

#....{@`.#  
#<..``{.{#  

The '@' is at (38,15) in previous steps, but now the agent is at (40,15), and the '.'s and symbols around. The '<' indicates the agent's facing direction. So maybe the agent is facing west, which would make sense if they moved east multiple times. 

In any case, the immediate goal is to push a boulder onto a fountain. The boulder is adjacent east and southwest. If the agent moves west to (39,15), they can then push the boulder west to (38,15), but that's not a fountain. The fountain is at (39,15) and (40,16). So perhaps the correct move is to push the boulder south into (39,16), which is then adjacent to the fountain at (40,16). 

But how to do that? The agent needs to be north of the boulder to push it south. If the boulder is at (39,15), the agent is at (40,15). So to push the boulder south, the agent would need to move west to (39,15), then push south into (39,16). Then, the boulder would be at (39,16), which is adjacent to the fountain at (40,16). But that's not on the fountain. The fountain is at (40,16), so the boulder needs to be placed there. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent can push the boulder east into (41,15), but that's not near a fountain. 

Another possibility is that there's a fountain at (39,15), and the agent needs to push the boulder there. If the boulder is at (40,15) (east of the agent), then the agent can push it west to (39,15), placing it on the fountain. But according to the language observation, the boulder is very near westsouthwest, which would be (39,14) or (39,15). If the boulder is at (39,15), then pushing it west would put it on the fountain at (39,15). That makes sense. 

So the plan is: move west to (39,15), then push the boulder west into (38,15), but that's not a fountain. Wait, but the fountain is at (39,15). So if the boulder is already at (39,15), pushing it west would move it away. Hmm. Maybe the boulder is at (40,15), east of the agent. Then the agent can move west to (39,15), stand next to the boulder, and push it west to (38,15). But then the fountain is at (39,15), so the boulder is next to it but not on it. 

Alternatively, maybe there's another approach. The agent has a sword and a lance, but pushing a boulder just requires moving into it from the front. 

Wait, the latest observation says the boulder is adjacent east and southwest. The agent is at (40,15). If the boulder is at (41,15) (east), then the agent can move west to (40,15) → (39,15), then push east into (41,15). But that doesn't help. 

Alternatively, if the boulder is at (39,14) (southwest), then the agent can move southwest to (39,14), then push north or east. But I'm not sure. 

This is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to outline possible steps:

1. The agent's current position is (40,15), facing west (assuming the '<' means west).
2. The boulder is adjacent east (41,15) and southwest (40,14 or 39,15).
3. The fountain is at (40,16) and (39,15).
4. To get the boulder onto the fountain at (39,15), the agent needs to push the boulder there.
5. If the boulder is at (39,15), the agent is already west of it. So push west to (38,15), but that's not the fountain.
6. If the boulder is at (40,14) (southwest of agent), then the agent can move to (40,14), push north to (40,15) (agent's position), which doesn't help.
7. Alternatively, if the boulder is at (41,15) (east), the agent can move west to (40,15), then push west into (39,15), which is the fountain. 

Wait, that makes sense. If the boulder is at (41,15), east of the agent, then the agent can move west to (40,15), then push west into (39,15), placing the boulder on the fountain at (39,15). 

But according to the language observation, the boulder is very near westsouthwest, which would be more to the west than southwest. So perhaps the boulder is at (39,15). In that case, the agent is west of the boulder, and needs to push it east into (40,15), but that's where the agent is. Not helpful. 

Alternatively, maybe the boulder is at (39,16), south of the agent's previous position. But the agent is now at (40,15). 

This is confusing. Let me look again at the latest map:

In the agent's current position (40,15), the map shows:

First line (y=15): #....{@`.#  
Second line (y=16): #<..``{.{#  

The '@' is at (38,15), and the '<' is at (39,15) in the second line, indicating the agent is facing east? Because the '<' usually represents the agent facing west. Maybe the map's orientation is different. Alternatively, the '<' is part of the environment. 

This is tricky. Let's try to focus on the immediate adjacent tiles. 

The agent is at (40,15). The boulder is adjacent east and southwest. So east is (41,15), southwest is (40,14) or (39,15). 

If the boulder is at (41,15), the agent can move west to (40,15), then push west into (39,15), which is the fountain. That would solve the problem. 

Alternatively, if the boulder is at (39,15), the agent is west of it and can't push it further west without moving. 

Given that the fountain is at (39,15) and (40,16), the optimal move is to push the boulder to (39,15). 

Assuming the boulder is at (41,15), the agent can move west to (40,15) (which they are already at), then push west into (39,15), placing the boulder on the fountain. 

So the action should be to push the boulder west. To do that, the agent needs to move into the same cell as the boulder and then move in the direction they want to push. 

Since the boulder is east of the agent, the agent needs to be north, south, or west of the boulder to push it. Wait, to push a boulder, you have to move into it from the direction you want to push. For example, to push a boulder north, you move north into it, and it moves north. 

So if the boulder is at (41,15) (east of agent at 40,15), the agent needs to move east into (41,15), then push west. But the agent is already at (40,15). So first, move east to (41,15), then push west into (40,15). But that would just swap their positions. 

Wait, no. If the agent is at (40,15) and the boulder is at (41,15), the agent can move east to (41,15), then push west, moving the boulder to (40,15). But the agent is already there. That's not useful. 

Alternatively, if the boulder is at (39,15), south of the agent's previous position, but the agent is now at (40,15). Then the agent can move west to (39,15), then push west into (38,15), but that's not a fountain. 

Hmm. Maybe the correct approach is to move south to (40,16), where there's a fountain adjacent. Then, if there's a boulder nearby, push it there. 

Looking at the language observation, the boulder is adjacent east and southwest. From the agent's position (40,15), south is (40,16), which has a fountain. If the boulder is at (41,15) (east), the agent can move south to (40,16), then move east to (41,15), push west into (40,15), but that's where the agent is. 

This is getting too confusing without a clear map layout. Let me try to summarize:

- Agent is at (40,15).
- Boulder is adjacent east (41,15) and southwest (40,14 or 39,15).
- Fountain is at (40,16) and (39,15).
- To push a boulder onto a fountain, need to move the boulder to either (39,15) or (40,16).

If the boulder is at (41,15), pushing it west to (40,15) places it in the agent's current position, which is not a fountain. 

If the boulder is at (39,15), pushing it west to (38,15) doesn't help. But if the boulder is at (39,16), pushing it south to (39,17) might not reach the fountain. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to move to (39,15) and push the boulder south into (39,16), which is adjacent to the fountain at (40,16). Then, the boulder is at (39,16), which is near the fountain but not on it. 

Alternatively, perhaps there's a different boulder. The language observation mentions ""boulder very near westsouthwest"", which could be at (39,14). Pushing it east to (40,14), then south to (40,15), but that's the agent's position. 

I'm stuck. Let's look at the inventory. The agent has a sword and a lance, but those aren't useful for pushing boulders. The key is to move the boulder into the fountain. 

Given the confusion in map parsing, the safest bet might be to move towards the fountain at (40,16) and try to push the boulder there. So move south to (40,16), then check if the boulder is adjacent and can be pushed south. 

But the boulder is adjacent east and southwest. From (40,16), east is (41,16), southwest is (39,15) or (40,15). If the boulder is at (39,15), which is southwest of (40,16), then the agent can move west to (39,15), push south to (39,16), placing it near the fountain at (40,16). 

Alternatively, if the boulder is at (41,15), the agent can move south to (40,16), then east to (41,15), push west to (40,15), but that doesn't help. 

Given the time I've spent and the need to choose an action, I'll go with moving south to (40,16) to get closer to the fountain and see if the boulder can be pushed there.

Let's see. I need to push the boulder onto the fountain in Boxoban. The current position of the agent is (40, 16) according to the cursor info. Let me look at the map again to get a better sense of where everything is.

The map shows that the agent is at position (40, 16). The surrounding areas: to the north, there are bars mentioned in the language observation. Bars are obstacles I can't pass through. The fountain is adjacent to the northwest direction. Also, there's a boulder very near the west. Oh, and the boulder adjacent to northeast and west. The agent is currently next to a boulder to the west (x=39, y=15), and the fountain is adjacent to the northwest. 

Let me break down the possible moves. The agent is at (40,16). The boulder is at (39,15) to the west. To push the boulder, the agent needs to move into it. But first, check if there's space behind the boulder. The boulder is adjacent to west, so the direction to push it would be west. Wait, but the agent is already west of the boulder? No, the agent is at (40,16), and the boulder is at (39,15). So the boulder is to the west and south of the agent. 

Wait, coordinates: in many games, (x,y) might mean x is east-west and y is north-south. So moving north would decrease y, and south would increase y. The agent is at (40,16). The boulder is at (39,15), which is one step west (x decreases by 1) and one step south (y increases by 1). So to push the boulder, the agent needs to move into it from the direction it's facing. If the agent is facing east (since they moved east several times), then moving east would take them towards (41,16), but there's a boulder at (40,15) according to the previous observations. Wait, maybe I need to recheck the map.

Looking at the map:

The agent's position is marked with '@' at (40,16). The line for that row is ""#<..``@.{#"". So the '@' is in the fifth position (assuming each '#' is a position). So the map line is:

# < . . ` ` @ . { # 

So the agent is between two '.' and the boulder is at (39,15) perhaps. Wait, maybe the map's y=15 is the row above. Since the agent is at (40,16), the map's row 16 would be the one with '@'. Let me check the cursor info again. It says the agent is at (x=40, y=15) in some observations, but later at (40,16). Wait, there's inconsistency here. Maybe the coordinate system is different. Let's try to parse the map structure.

The map has multiple rows. Each row represents a y-coordinate. The agent's position is (40,16), which would correspond to the 16th row (if rows start at 1). Looking at the map provided:

After several blank lines, the map starts with:

Agent the Gallant ... 

Assuming each line is a y-coordinate, starting from the top. So the first line after the blank lines is y=1, then y=2, etc. The line with ""#`.@{.`.#"" is y=8, and the line with ""#<..``{.{#"" is y=9. Wait, no, the agent's position in the latest observation is (40,16), which would be y=16. But looking at the map provided, after the initial 5 blank lines, the next lines are:

                                  ##########  (y=1)

Agent the Gallant ... 

So the agent's current position (40,16) must be in one of the lower rows, but the map provided only goes down to y=10. This might be a truncation or formatting issue. Alternatively, perhaps the map is displayed differently. Maybe each line represents a row, and the y-coordinate increases downward. So the agent's position y=16 would be further down, but the map provided doesn't show those lines. This complicates things, but perhaps I can proceed with the available info.

The key points are:

- The agent is at (40,16).
- There's a boulder very near west (so possibly at (39,16) or (40,15)).
- The fountain is adjacent to the northwest. Northwest would be up and left, so y decreases and x decreases.
- The bars are blocking certain directions, particularly north and northeast.

Looking at the latest language observation:

bars adjacent north, northeast, and northwest.

fountain adjacent northwest.

So the fountain is to the northwest of the agent. To reach the fountain, the agent needs to move northwest, but there are bars there. Wait, the bars are adjacent north, northeast, and northwest. So the agent can't go north, northeast, or northwest directly. But the boulder is to the west. If the agent can push the boulder towards the northwest direction towards the fountain, that would solve the problem.

The boulder is at (39,15) according to previous observations, but in the latest map, the agent is at (40,16) with a boulder very near west. So the boulder is likely at (39,16), one step west. To push it northwest, the agent would need to move west into the boulder, then north. But since the agent is already adjacent to the boulder west, moving west would push it. Wait, the agent is at (40,16), boulder at (39,16). So moving west (to x=39, y=16) would allow pushing the boulder. But the direction to push it would be west. Wait, no. To push the boulder west, the agent needs to move west into it. But if the agent moves west, they would be next to the boulder, and then the boulder would move into the next west position. But the goal is to get the boulder onto the fountain, which is adjacent northwest. So after pushing the boulder west once, it would be at (38,16). Then maybe move north to push it further? But there are bars to the north. Alternatively, maybe push it northwest in one move.

Wait, in Sokoban-like games, you can push a boulder in the direction you're moving, provided the space behind the boulder is free. So if the agent is next to the boulder, and moves in the direction opposite to where they want the boulder to go, the boulder moves forward. For example, to push a boulder to the west, the agent needs to move west into it, causing the boulder to move west.

In this case, the agent is at (40,16). The boulder is at (39,16). To push the boulder west to (38,16), the agent needs to move west into it. Then, if the space behind the boulder (west of 38,16) is free, the boulder can be pushed further. However, the language observation says the boulder adjacent northwest. The fountain is adjacent northwest, so perhaps after pushing the boulder northwest once.

Wait, the agent's current position is (40,16). If they move west into the boulder at (39,16), the boulder would move to (38,16). Then, moving north from (40,16) would take the agent to (40,15), but there's a bars very near north. Alternatively, after moving the boulder west to (38,16), the agent could move north to (40,15) and then push the boulder northwest. But I need to check if the space behind the boulder is free.

Alternatively, maybe the agent can move north first, but the bars are blocking that. The latest observation says bars adjacent north, northeast, and northwest. So the agent can't move directly north. So the best approach is to push the boulder west, then see if moving northwest is possible.

So step by step:

1. Move west to (39,16) to push the boulder to (38,16).
2. Then, check if moving northwest from (38,16) is possible. The fountain is adjacent northwest, so if the boulder is pushed to (38,15), then it's adjacent to the fountain at (38,14)? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the fountain is at (37,15) or similar.

But given the information, pushing the boulder west and then north might get it closer to the fountain. Alternatively, maybe the agent can move diagonally, but in standard Boxoban, you can only move in four directions. So the agent needs to push the boulder in straight directions.

Another consideration: the bars are blocking north, so the agent can't go north. Therefore, pushing the boulder south might not help. The best bet is to move the boulder west and then see. Once the boulder is west, the agent can move north around the bars or find another path.

But the immediate goal is to push the boulder onto the fountain. The fountain is adjacent northwest, so the boulder needs to be placed there. If the boulder is at (38,15), and the fountain is at (38,14), then pushing the boulder north from (38,16) to (38,15) would get it closer. Then push north again to (38,14) if that's the fountain's position.

But based on the latest map, the fountain is adjacent northwest. The agent is at (40,16). Northwest would be (39,15). The boulder is at (39,16). So if the agent pushes the boulder north to (39,15), that would place it on the fountain at (39,15). But wait, the fountain is at (39,15)? The language observation says fountain adjacent east. Earlier observations mentioned the fountain is near eastsoutheast. Maybe there's confusion in the coordinate system.

Alternatively, the fountain is at (39,15), which is northwest of the agent's current position (40,16). So to get the boulder there, the agent needs to push it from (39,16) to (39,15). That would require the agent to move north into the boulder. But the agent is at (40,16), so moving north would take them to (40,15), which has bars. However, the boulder is at (39,16). If the agent moves north to (40,15), which is blocked by bars, they can't. So instead, the agent needs to move west into the boulder at (39,16), pushing it to (38,16). Then, from there, move north to (38,15), which is the fountain's position.

So the sequence would be:

1. Move west (current position (40,16) to (39,16), pushing the boulder to (38,16)).
2. Move north (from (39,16) to (39,15), pushing the boulder to (38,15), which is the fountain).

This way, the boulder would be placed on the fountain. But I need to check if the space behind the boulder in step 2 is free. After moving the boulder to (38,16), the agent is at (39,16). To push it north to (38,15), the agent needs to move north into the boulder. The space behind the boulder (north of (38,16)) would be (38,15), which is the fountain. Since fountains are target positions, pushing the boulder there would solve the level.

Therefore, the correct actions are west then north. However, the agent can only perform one action at a time. So first, the agent should move west to push the boulder west. Then, move north to push it north onto the fountain.

In the current observation, the agent is at (40,16), and the boulder is very near west (so at (39,16)). The immediate action should be to move west to push the boulder. Then, in the next step, move north. But since the user is asking for the next action based on the current observation, the best immediate action is to move west to start pushing the boulder towards the fountain.

Let's try to figure out the next move here. The goal is to push boulders onto fountains. From the current observation, the agent is at position (40, 16). Let me look at the map and the surrounding elements.

The map shows a bunch of bars and dark areas, which I assume are walls or obstacles. There's a boulder at (westnorthwest), which is probably near position (39,15) or similar. The fountains are adjacent to the northwest, which is likely at (39,14) or nearby. The agent's current position is (40,16), and there's a boulder adjacent to the west and northeast. 

The message says ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain,"" which probably means the agent tried to push a boulder but couldn't because it's blocked. The previous actions were moving east multiple times, then south, west, etc. The latest action was west, bringing the agent to (40,16). 

Looking at the adjacent boulders: there's one to the west (position 39,16) and another to the northeast (maybe 41,15 or similar). The fountains are adjacent to the northwest, so maybe (39,14). To push a boulder onto a fountain, the agent needs to be next to the boulder and the fountain in the right direction. 

The agent is currently at (40,16). If there's a boulder to the west (39,16), maybe pushing it west to (38,16) would clear the path or move it towards a fountain. But check if there's a fountain in that direction. The fountain is adjacent to the northwest, which is north and west. From (40,16), moving west to (39,16) is where the boulder is. If the boulder is at (39,16), pushing it west to (38,16) might get it closer to the fountain at (39,14), but that's two squares away. Alternatively, maybe the boulder needs to be moved north or northwest.

Wait, the fountains are adjacent to the northwest. The agent's current position is (40,16). Northwest would be (39,15). Is there a fountain there? The language observation says ""fountain adjacent northwest,"" so maybe at (39,15). The boulder is at (39,16) (west of agent's current position). If the agent moves west to (39,16), then pushes the boulder northwest to (38,15), that would place the boulder on the fountain at (39,15). Wait, no—if the boulder is at (39,16) and pushed northwest, it would go to (38,15), which is adjacent to the fountain at (39,15). That might work. 

So the steps would be: move west to (39,16) to be adjacent to the boulder, then push it northwest to (38,15), landing it on the fountain at (39,15). That should solve the puzzle. 

But the agent's last action was west to (40,16), and there's a boulder adjacent to the west (39,16). So the next action should be to move west again to (39,16) to get next to the boulder, then push it northwest. However, the agent needs to be facing the correct direction to push. If the agent is at (40,16) and moves west to (39,16), then pushes northwest, that would be the action. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent can push the boulder north first. But from (39,16), pushing north would take it to (39,15), which is the fountain. Wait, that's possible. If the boulder is at (39,16), and the agent is at (39,16) after moving west, then pushing north would move the boulder to (39,15), which is the fountain. That seems better because it's directly into the fountain. 

So the correct sequence would be: move west to (39,16), then push north to (39,15), landing the boulder on the fountain. 

Therefore, the next action should be north, but only after moving west to be adjacent. Since the agent is already at (40,16) with a boulder to the west, the immediate action should be to move west to (39,16), then push north. However, the agent can only push in the direction they are facing. So if the agent is at (40,16) and moves west to (39,16), their facing is west. To push the boulder north, they need to be facing north. Wait, no—when you push a boulder, you move into it from behind, so you need to be facing the direction you want to push it. 

If the agent is at (39,16) (west of current position), facing west, and the boulder is at (39,16), then to push it north, the agent needs to face north and then push. But maybe the agent is already facing north after moving west? Not sure. The map shows the agent's position with <@..``@.{#>, which might indicate the facing direction. Looking at the map line for y=16, the agent is at position x=40, which is the last character in that line: #<..``@.{#. The '<' might indicate the facing direction. If the '<' is facing west, then the agent is facing west. So to push the boulder north, the agent needs to turn north first, but turning isn't an allowed action here—only movement. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent can push the boulder north by moving north while adjacent. Wait, when you move into a boulder, you push it if there's space behind. So if the agent is at (39,16) facing north, and moves north into the boulder at (39,16), that would push the boulder to (39,15). But the agent's current position is (40,16), and the boulder is at (39,16). So the agent needs to move west to (39,16), then move north into the boulder, pushing it to (39,15), which is the fountain. 

Therefore, the correct actions are: west to (39,16), then north. Since the agent's last action was west to (40,16), the next step is to move west again to (39,16), then push north. However, the problem is that the agent can't output two actions at once. The current observation is after moving west to (40,16), and the message says trying to move the boulder in vain, which might mean the agent tried to push but couldn't. So the agent is now at (40,16) with a boulder to the west at (39,16). To push the boulder, the agent needs to move west to (39,16) and then push north. 

But in the current state, the agent is at (40,16), and the boulder is at (39,16). So the next action should be west to get next to the boulder. Once there, the next action would be north to push it. However, since the agent can only output one action per turn, the immediate next action is to move west to (39,16). Then, in the following turn, push north. 

But the user is asking for the next action based on the current observation, which is after the agent moved west to (40,16) and received the message about failing to move the boulder. That suggests that the previous attempt to push the boulder was from position (40,16) towards the west, but perhaps the boulder wasn't adjacent. Wait, no—the boulder is at (39,16), which is west of (40,16). So if the agent is at (40,16) and tries to push the boulder west, they need to be adjacent. But they are one step away. Therefore, the agent needs to move west to (39,16) first, then push west or north. 

So the correct next action is west, moving to (39,16) to get adjacent to the boulder. Then, the following action would be to push north into the boulder, placing it on the fountain at (39,15). 

Given that the current observation is after the agent tried to move the boulder but failed (probably because not adjacent), the next logical step is to move west to get next to the boulder. Therefore, the action should be west.

Let's see. The goal is to push the boulders onto the fountains in Boxoban. The agent is a knight, and they've been moving around trying to push a boulder. The last few actions had them trying to move east and west but failing because the boulder wasn't moving. The latest observation shows that the agent is at (40, 16) and tried to move west but couldn't because of the boulder.

Looking at the map, the agent is near a boulder that's adjacent to the northeast and west. The fountains are adjacent to the northwest and southeast. The stairs are up near the west. The bars are all around, which are obstacles. 

The agent needs to position the boulder so it's against a fountain. The current position has a boulder very near the west, which might be the one they're trying to push. The fountain is adjacent to the northwest, so maybe pushing the boulder northwest towards that fountain. 

The agent's last action was west, which didn't work because the boulder is there. Maybe they need to move in a direction that allows them to push the boulder. Since the boulder is adjacent west and northeast, perhaps moving north or south could let them position themselves to push it. 

Looking at the cursor position (40,16), the boulder is to the west (40,15) and northeast (39,16). The fountain is northwest (39,15) and southeast (41,16). To push the boulder to the northwest fountain, the agent needs to move north or west near the boulder. But the boulder is at (40,15), so if the agent moves north to (40,15), they can push it northwest to (39,14), but that might not be towards the fountain. Wait, the fountain is at (39,15), which is northwest of the agent's current position (40,16). So the boulder needs to be moved to (39,15). 

To do that, the agent should move west to (39,16), then try pushing the boulder north to (39,15). But the boulder is at (40,15), so the agent needs to be next to it. Currently, the agent is at (40,16). The boulder is at (40,15), so the agent can move south to (40,15) and then push west to (39,15), which is the fountain. 

But in the last observation, when the agent tried to move west from (40,16), it couldn't because the boulder was adjacent west. So maybe moving south to get next to the boulder, then pushing west. Let me check the map again. The map shows at (40,15) there's a boulder (`{`), and the agent is at (40,16) with `@`. So the agent can move down (south) to (40,15), then push the boulder west to (39,15), which is the fountain. 

So the steps would be: south to get under the boulder, then push west. But the agent's last action was west, which failed because they weren't next to the boulder. So the correct action now is to move south once to position themselves, then push west. But the user's previous actions included moving south, then east, etc., but maybe they need to adjust. 

Alternatively, check if there's another path. The other boulder is at (39,16) according to the language observation, but the main one to push is at (40,15). So the priority is getting that boulder to the fountain at (39,15). 

So the next action should be south to reach (40,15), then push west. Since the agent is at (40,16), moving south to (40,15) is the first step. That should allow them to then push the boulder west into the fountain. 

Therefore, the correct action now is to move south once.

Let's see what's going on here. I'm playing Boxoban, and my goal is to push the boulders onto the fountains. The current situation is that I'm at position (40, 16). Looking at the map, there's a boulder very near the west, and there's a fountain to the northwest.

First, I need to check where the boulders are and where the fountains are. From the language observations, the boulder is adjacent to the northeast and west. The fountain is adjacent to the northwest. So the boulder next to the west might be near a fountain, but I need to confirm.

The previous attempts to move east or west resulted in either hitting bars or the boulder not moving. The message when trying to move east said, ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain,"" which means there's a boulder blocking that path. So maybe the boulder is right next to me, preventing me from moving east or west.

Looking at the cursor position, I'm at (40,16). The boulder adjacent to the west would be at (39,16). The fountain adjacent to the northwest is at (39,15). So if I can push the boulder at (39,16) towards the northwest fountain at (39,15), that would solve the problem.

To push the boulder, I need to move into it. Since the boulder is to the west (my current x is 40, so west is 39), moving west into the boulder would push it. But earlier attempts to move west resulted in the message about the boulder not moving. Wait, that's conflicting. Maybe there's something blocking the boulder's path when I try to push it west.

Wait, the message when trying to move west said, ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" That implies that there's an obstacle behind the boulder when I push it west. Let me check the bars and other obstacles. The bars adjacent to the southeast, south, and southwest, but the boulder is at (39,16). If I push it west to (38,16), is there a barrier there?

Looking at the map, there's a '##########' structure in the upper part, but my current position is further south. The map shows that at (38,16), there might be a wall or bar. Let me check the language observations again. The bars very near include north, eastsoutheast, westsouthwest, northwest, and northnorthwest. The bars adjacent are southeast, south, southwest. So pushing the boulder west from (39,16) to (38,16) might be blocked by a bar or another obstacle.

Alternatively, maybe pushing the boulder in a different direction. The boulder is adjacent to the northeast and west. If I can push it north or south instead. Let's see: the fountain is to the northwest, which is up and left. So pushing the boulder north to (39,15) where the fountain is. But to do that, I would need to move north into the boulder. However, my current position is (40,16), so moving north would take me to (40,15). The boulder is at (39,16), so moving north from there would require the boulder to be at (39,15). But the boulder is currently at (39,16), adjacent to west (my position). So if I move north towards the boulder at (39,16), I can push it north to (39,15), which is the fountain. That seems possible.

Wait, but how do I get into position to push it north? My current position is (40,16). To reach the boulder at (39,16), I need to move west once. But earlier attempts to move west resulted in the message about the boulder not moving, which might mean the path behind the boulder is blocked. If moving west once gets me next to the boulder, then moving north into it would push it to (39,15), the fountain. Let me verify.

If I move west from (40,16) to (39,16), that's adjacent to the boulder. Then, moving north from (39,16) into the boulder would push it to (39,15), which is the fountain. That should work. But earlier when I tried moving west, the message said I couldn't move the boulder. Maybe there was a different obstacle then. Let me check the latest observation.

In the latest observation, the bars adjacent are southeast, south, and southwest. The boulder is adjacent to northeast and west. So when I'm at (40,16), moving west to (39,16) is possible if the cell is empty except for the boulder. Then, moving north into the boulder would push it north. The cell (39,15) is the fountain, so that's the target.

But why did previous attempts to move west result in the boulder not moving? Maybe there was a bar in the way when I tried earlier. Let me check the map again. The map shows some structures with '#' which are walls or bars. At (39,15), is there a bar? The language observations mention bars very near north, eastsoutheast, westsouthwest, northwest, and northnorthwest. The bars adjacent are southeast, south, southwest. So (39,15) is north of the boulder at (39,16). The bars near there might be in other directions. If there's no bar at (39,15), then pushing the boulder there would be possible.

Assuming the path is clear, the correct sequence would be: move west to (39,16) to get next to the boulder, then move north to push it to (39,15), the fountain. So the next action should be north.

",-0.001,False
32,west,"<reasoning>
Let me try to figure out what the best move is here. I'm playing Boxoban, right? The goal is to push all the boulders onto the fountains. Looking at the current observation, the agent is at position (40, 15). The map has walls (bars) all around, so movement is restricted. There's a boulder very near westsouthwest, and a fountain adjacent to the southwest. The stairs up are near westsouthwest too.

First, I need to check where the boulders are and where the fountains are. From the language observations, the boulder is very near westsouthwest, and there's a fountain adjacent to southwest and west. So one boulder is near westsouthwest, and maybe another one? Wait, the previous messages mentioned moving a boulder before, but now there's a boulder adjacent east and southwest. Hmm, maybe there are multiple boulders. Let me parse the observations again.

The latest message says ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" when moving west earlier. That suggests there's a boulder blocking the way. The cursor is at (40,15), and the adjacent boulders are east and southwest. So the agent is trying to move west but there's a boulder there. The fountains are adjacent to southwest and west. So maybe the boulder near westsouthwest is the one that needs to be pushed onto the fountain.

Wait, the boulder very near westsouthwest—so that's southwest of the agent's current position. The agent is at (40,15). If the boulder is southwest, that would be (39,16) or (40,16). But the cursor is at (40,16) in the previous step. Hmm, maybe coordinates are x,y where moving south increases y. So the agent was at (40,15) then moved south to (40,16), but then tried moving west and couldn't because of a boulder.

The goal is to push the boulder onto the fountain. The fountain is adjacent to southwest and west. So if the boulder is near westsouthwest, pushing it towards the southwest fountain might work. But the agent is blocked by a boulder to the west. Let me visualize the map.

The map shows the agent's position with `<..``@.{#`, which I think means the agent is facing a certain direction. The boulder is adjacent east and southwest. So to the east is a boulder, and to the southwest is another boulder. The agent is at (40,15), so southwest would be (39,14) perhaps. But the fountain is adjacent to southwest and west. So the fountain is probably at (40,14) or (39,14).

To reach the boulder at southwest, the agent needs to move southwest, but there's a boulder to the west blocking the way. Wait, the adjacent boulders are east and southwest. So the agent is facing a direction where east is blocked by a boulder, and southwest is also blocked. Maybe the agent needs to move around the boulders.

Alternatively, maybe the boulder near westsouthwest is the one to push. The agent needs to position themselves so they can push that boulder towards the fountain. Since the stairs are up near westsouthwest, but the goal is to push boulders to fountains, maybe the priority is to get the boulder off the stairs and onto the fountain.

The agent tried moving west before, but there's a boulder there. So perhaps they need to move south to get around the boulder. Wait, the agent is at (40,15), and moving south would take them to (40,16). From there, maybe they can move west? But earlier attempts to move west resulted in the message ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" So there's a boulder adjacent to the agent's current position (40,16) to the west.

Wait, the cursor is at (40,16) with the map showing `#<..``@.{#`. The `<` might indicate the agent's facing direction. If the agent is facing west, then the boulder would be to the west of them, which is (39,16). But they tried moving west and couldn't because the boulder is there. So to push that boulder, they need to move west, but it's blocked. Wait, no. To push a boulder, you have to move into it, right? So if the agent is facing west and tries to move west, they would push the boulder if there's space behind it. But the message says they couldn't move the boulder, which might mean there's no space behind it or another obstacle.

Looking at the language observations, the boulder adjacent east and southwest. So at (40,15), the agent is at x=40, y=15. Adjacent east would be x=41, y=15, and southwest would be x=39, y=16. So the boulders are to the east and southwest. The agent is trying to move west, which is blocked by the southwest boulder? Wait, maybe the coordinates are a bit different. Let me think again.

In MiniHack, the coordinate system is typically (x, y) where moving north decreases y. But the user hasn't specified, but in previous steps, moving south increased the y-coordinate. For example, initial position was (37,15), then moved south to (37,16), then west to (36,16), etc. So y increases when moving south.

So the agent is at (40,15). Adjacent boulders: east (41,15) and southwest (39,16). So the boulder to the east is directly in front if the agent is facing east, but the agent is currently facing a different direction. The map shows the agent's symbol as `<..``@.{#`, which might indicate facing west. The `<` character typically represents the agent facing west. So if the agent is facing west, their position is (40,15), and to their west is (39,15). But there's a boulder adjacent to the agent's west, which would be (39,15). But the language observation says the boulder is adjacent east and southwest. Wait, that doesn't align. Maybe the coordinates are different.

Alternatively, maybe the adjacent boulders are to the agent's east (41,15) and southwest (39,16). So if the agent is facing west, trying to move west would take them to (39,15), but there's a boulder there. So they can't move west. To push the boulder to the west, they need to move into it. But since moving west is blocked, they can't. So perhaps the agent needs to move around the boulder.

Looking at the fountains, they are adjacent to southwest and west. The southwest fountain would be at (39,14), and the west fountain at (40,14). The boulder near westsouthwest is probably at (39,15), which is between the agent and the west fountain. If the agent can push that boulder south to (39,16), then maybe it can be moved onto the fountain at (39,14). But there's a boulder at (39,16) as well (adjacent southwest). Wait, the agent is at (40,15), and the adjacent boulders are east (41,15) and southwest (39,16). So the boulder at (39,16) is southwest of the agent. To reach it, the agent would need to move south to (40,16), then southwest to (39,16). But there's already a boulder there. Maybe the agent needs to push that boulder.

Alternatively, the boulder at (39,16) is adjacent to the agent's southwest. If the agent moves south to (40,16), then they can face the boulder at (39,16) and try to push it west to (39,15), which is where the agent is currently blocked. But that might not help. Alternatively, push the boulder at (39,16) south to (39,17), but there might be walls or other obstacles.

The stairs up are near westsouthwest, which is probably (39,14) or similar. The priority is to get the boulders onto the fountains. The fountain adjacent to southwest and west suggests that pushing a boulder from westsouthwest (like (39,15)) to the west fountain at (40,14) would work. But how to get there.

The agent is at (40,15), facing west. They can't move west due to the boulder at (39,15). So they need to move around. Maybe move south to (40,16), then west to (39,16), but there's a boulder there. Then push that boulder south to (39,17), but is there space? The map shows bars (walls) around, so maybe not. Alternatively, push the boulder at (39,16) west to (39,15), which is where the agent is blocked. That might not be useful.

Alternatively, look for another boulder. The language observation mentions a boulder very near westsouthwest, which could be (39,15). If the agent can push that boulder towards the west fountain at (40,14), they need to get around the current obstacles. The agent is at (40,15), facing west. They need to move south to (40,16), then east to (41,16), then south to (41,17), looking for a path. But this is getting complicated.

Wait, the latest message after moving west was ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" So the boulder is directly in the agent's path. To push it, the agent needs to move in the direction opposite to where they want to push the boulder. For example, to push a boulder east, the agent needs to move west into it. But if there's a wall or another boulder behind it, they can't.

In this case, the boulder adjacent to the agent's west (39,15) is blocking the way. To push it west to (39,14), which is the fountain's position, the agent would need to move west into it, but (39,15) is occupied by the boulder. So the agent should move west, pushing the boulder. But the message says they can't, which implies there's no space behind the boulder. Looking at the map, to the west of the boulder at (39,15) is (39,14), which is a fountain. So there should be space. Unless there's a wall.

The map shows a lot of bars (walls) around. Let me check the map's layout. The agent's current map line is #<..``@.{#. The `@` is the agent, surrounded by other characters. The bars are likely surrounding the play area. So maybe pushing the boulder west into the fountain is possible, but the agent is blocked by another boulder to the west (at (39,15)).

Wait, the adjacent boulders are east and southwest. So at (40,15), east is (41,15) and southwest is (39,16). The boulder at (39,16) is southwest of the agent. To reach it, the agent needs to move south to (40,16), then west to (39,16). But there's a boulder there. So they can't move into that space. Therefore, they need to find another way.

Perhaps the agent should move north to (40,14), then try to navigate around. But the map's previous steps didn't show north as passable. Alternatively, look for a path that allows pushing the boulder towards the fountain.

Another approach: The boulder near westsouthwest (probably (39,15)) is between the agent and the west fountain. If the agent can move south to (40,16), then west to (39,16) (which has a boulder), then south to (39,17), and try to push that boulder west. But this might not lead to the fountain. Alternatively, the boulder at (39,16) can be pushed south to (39,17), but if there's a wall, that's not possible.

Given the limited information and the recent observations, the best action seems to be to move around the blocking boulders to reach the target boulder and push it towards the fountain. Since moving west and east are blocked, perhaps moving south to (40,16) and then trying to navigate west from there. But the agent was already at (40,16) and tried moving west, which was blocked by the boulder at (39,16). So maybe move south again to (40,17), but I don't know if that's possible.

Alternatively, check if there's a boulder that can be pushed into the fountain. The fountain is adjacent to southwest and west. If the agent can push a boulder from westsouthwest (39,15) to west (40,14), that would work. But to do that, the agent needs to be adjacent to the boulder and have space behind it. The agent is at (40,15), facing west. The boulder is at (39,15). To push it west, the agent needs to move west into it, which would require the space at (39,14) to be empty. Since (39,14) is a fountain, that's allowed. So the agent should move west, pushing the boulder into (39,14), which is a fountain. But earlier attempts to move west resulted in failure, which might mean there's another boulder in the way.

Wait, the adjacent boulders are east and southwest. The boulder at (39,16) is southwest, not directly blocking the path to (39,15). So maybe the agent can move west into (39,15), pushing the boulder to (39,14), which is a fountain. That should solve the problem. But why did previous attempts to move west fail? Maybe there's a misunderstanding in the coordinates.

Alternatively, the agent might need to reposition themselves. Maybe move south to (40,16), then west to (39,16) (but that's blocked), then south to (39,17), and try to push from there. But without knowing the layout beyond, it's hard to say.

Given the latest observations, the best action is probably to move west again, hoping that the previous blockage was due to a different boulder. Or check if there's another direction to push.

Wait, the boulder adjacent southwest is at (39,16). If the agent moves south to (40,16), then west to (39,16), but that's blocked. So they can't. Maybe move south twice to (40,17), then west? Not sure.

Alternatively, since the agent has a ladder (the stairs up are near westsouthwest), but the goal is to push boulders to fountains, the priority is to get the boulder onto the fountain. Given the information, the most logical action is to try to push the boulder at (39,15) west into the fountain at (40,14). To do that, the agent needs to move west into it. Even though previous attempts failed, maybe there was a misunderstanding. Perhaps the agent needs to face west and then move west again.

So the chosen action is to move west again, to push the boulder into the fountain.

Let's see. I need to figure out the best move here. The agent is at (39, 15), and the previous actions have been moving around trying to push the boulder.

Looking at the map, there's a boulder very near east. The agent just moved west to (39,15) after being at (40,15). The goal is to push boulders onto fountains. From the language observations, there's a fountain very near eastsoutheast and another adjacent southeast. 

The boulder is adjacent southeast and south. So maybe the agent needs to move the boulder towards the fountain to the southeast. Let's check the movement options. The agent is currently at (39,15). If they move south, they could get closer to the boulder. But the boulder is already adjacent south. Wait, the boulder adjacent south and southwest. So the agent is north of the boulder. 

To push the boulder south, the agent needs to move into the boulder's position. So moving south would allow the agent to push the boulder south into the fountain. Let's confirm the fountain's location. The fountain is adjacent southeast. If the agent pushes the boulder south, it would go towards (39,16), which is adjacent to the fountain at southeast. 

So the action should be south. That way, the agent moves into the boulder's spot, pushing it south onto the fountain. Let me double-check the message history. Previously, when trying to move east or other directions, there were obstacles like bars or other boulders. Moving south seems the right direction here.

",-0.001,False
34,south,"<reasoning>
I need to figure out the best action for the agent in this Boxoban-like game. Let me start by understanding the current state.

First, the agent is located at position (39, 15). The map shows some obstacles (bars) and a boulder that's adjacent to the southwest and south. There's a fountain to the southeast, which is the target where the boulder needs to be pushed. The agent has already tried moving east multiple times but hit bars, so that's not working. 

Looking at the previous actions, the agent tried moving east, then west, south, and other directions. The latest observation shows that the boulder is near the east, and the agent is trying to push it but failing because there's something blocking it. The message ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain"" indicates that the path behind the boulder is blocked, probably by another obstacle like a bar or another boulder.

The goal is to push the boulder onto the fountain. The fountain is at eastsoutheast, so the boulder needs to be moved in that direction. The agent is currently at (39,15). The boulder is very near east, so it's probably adjacent to the agent. If the agent moves east again, they might be trying to push the boulder, but if there's a bar or another obstacle behind it, that won't work.

Looking at the map, the agent's current position in the 9th row (assuming rows are y-coordinates) has a '<' character, which might represent the agent facing a certain direction. The boulder is at (40,15) as per previous observations. The fountain is at eastsoutheast, which would be towards the southeast direction from the boulder's position.

To push the boulder onto the fountain, the agent needs to position it so that moving it southeast would place it on the fountain. However, the current obstacles (bars) are blocking the path. The agent might need to navigate around the bars to reposition the boulder.

Another approach is to check if there's a clear path to move the boulder west or north, then adjust its position towards the fountain. Alternatively, maybe the agent can move south to get a better angle. But the previous attempt to move south resulted in a message about bars blocking, so that might not be possible.

The agent's inventory has a long sword and a lance, but since this is a box-pushing game, using weapons probably isn't the right approach here. The focus should be on movement and pushing the boulder.

Considering the latest observation, the boulder is adjacent to the agent's east (since the agent is at 39,15 and the boulder at 40,15). The agent tried moving east but hit bars. So, maybe the path east is blocked by bars, preventing the boulder from being pushed further east. To get the boulder onto the fountain, the agent might need to push it south or southeast. 

Looking at the language observation, the fountain is very near eastsoutheast. So, the direction from the boulder's current position (40,15) towards southeast would be south and east. But the bars in that direction might be blocking. The agent should check if moving the boulder south first, then east, or east then south could work.

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to move west to create space, then push the boulder east. But previous attempts to move west resulted in the same ""in vain"" message because the boulder's path is blocked.

Another possibility is that the agent needs to climb or use a different ability, but in Boxoban, typically you just move the boulder by walking into it. Since the agent can't push the boulder east due to bars, perhaps moving south to reposition.

Wait, the agent's current position is (39,15), and the boulder is at (40,15). If the agent moves east, they would be at (40,15), which is where the boulder is. So perhaps the agent needs to move in a different direction to get around the bars.

Looking at the map, the bars are very near north, northeast, etc. The agent's current y-coordinate is 15. If the agent moves south to y=16, maybe there's a path. But in the previous observation, moving south resulted in a message about bars blocking. 

Alternatively, the agent could try moving northwest or northeast to find a clear path. But given the previous attempts, it's possible the bars are blocking those directions as well.

Given the constraints, the most logical next step is to try pushing the boulder in a direction that isn't blocked. Since pushing east is blocked by bars, maybe pushing south or southeast. But the message when trying to move the boulder says ""in vain,"" so the path behind it must be blocked. Therefore, the agent needs to find a way to move the boulder by first clearing the path behind it.

Alternatively, perhaps the agent should move in a direction that allows them to reposition the boulder around the bars. For example, moving west to get to (38,15) and then pushing the boulder east towards the fountain. But previous attempts to move west didn't work because the boulder's path was blocked.

Wait, in the latest observation, the boulder is very near east, so at (40,15). The agent is at (39,15). The bars adjacent are north, northeast, and northwest. So, if the agent moves north to y=14, maybe there's a path. But the language observation says the bars are very near north, so moving north might hit bars again.

Hmm, this is tricky. The key is to get the boulder onto the fountain at eastsoutheast. The boulder is currently at (40,15), and the fountain is southeast of that. So the agent needs to push the boulder south and east. But the bars are blocking the way. The agent must find a way around the bars to position the boulder correctly.

Another idea: maybe the agent can move south to y=16, then push the boulder east and south. But previous moves south resulted in bars blocking. Alternatively, moving northeast or southeast from the boulder's position.

Wait, the agent's current position is (39,15). If they move east to (40,15), they're next to the boulder. The boulder is at (40,15), so pushing it east would require the agent to be behind it. Since the agent is already east of the boulder, maybe they need to push it south or southeast.

But the message says they can't push it because the path is blocked. So, perhaps the agent needs to move in a way that allows them to be behind the boulder. For example, moving south to y=16, then pushing the boulder east. But the bars are in the way.

Alternatively, the agent could try moving southwest to (38,16) and then push the boulder southeast. But I need to check the map layout.

Looking at the map provided, the ninth row (y=9) has the agent's position at <...@....{.#, which might indicate the agent is facing east (since the '@' is to the east of the '<'). The boulder is at (40,15) in the ninth row as well, represented by '{'.

The bars are in various directions, but the most immediate barrier is to the east of the boulder. So, pushing the boulder east is blocked by bars. Therefore, the agent needs to find another way to move the boulder towards the fountain.

Perhaps the solution is to move the boulder south first. If the agent can push the boulder south to y=16, then they can push it east. But the bars adjacent to the boulder's current position are north, northeast, and northwest. So moving south might be possible if there's no bar there.

Looking at the language observation, the bars very near the boulder include north, northeast, etc., but not south. So maybe the path south is clear. If the agent can push the boulder south to (40,16), then from there, they can push it east towards the fountain.

To do that, the agent needs to be south of the boulder. Currently, the agent is at (39,15), and the boulder is at (40,15). So the agent can move east to (40,15), then move south to (40,16), and push the boulder south. But the message when trying to push the boulder says ""in vain,"" which implies the path behind it is blocked. So perhaps moving south from the boulder's current position is blocked by bars.

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to move in a different direction. Let me check the latest language observation again.

The latest language observation says: ""bars very near north, northnortheast, northeast, southeast, southsoutheast, south, southsouthwest, southwest, westnorthwest, northwest, and northnorthwest."" So the boulder at (40,15) has bars in almost all directions except maybe east. But since the fountain is to the eastsoutheast, perhaps the path east from the boulder is blocked by bars.

Therefore, the agent needs to find a way to move the boulder around the bars. One possible path is to push the boulder west, then north, then east. But the agent tried moving west and encountered blocks.

Alternatively, the agent could move north around the bars, then east. But the bars are very near north, so that might not be possible.

Wait, the agent's current position is (39,15). If they move north to (39,14), maybe there's a clear path. But the language observation mentions bars very near north, so that's likely blocked.

Another angle: the stairs up are near westsouthwest, which might be a way to go down to another level, but the goal is to push the boulder on this level.

Given all this, the best possible action might be to try pushing the boulder south again, even though previous attempts didn't work. Or perhaps the agent needs to reposition themselves to the southwest of the boulder to push it southeast.

Alternatively, since the boulder is adjacent to the agent's east, maybe the agent should try pushing it in a diagonal direction, but Boxoban typically doesn't allow diagonal movements for pushing.

Considering all this, the most logical next step is to attempt pushing the boulder south. The agent is at (39,15), so moving south to (39,16), then pushing the boulder south to (40,16). If that's possible, then the boulder can be moved east from there.

But the previous attempts to move south resulted in messages about bars blocking. However, the latest observation after moving south says ""You cannot pass through the bars,"" which suggests that moving south from the agent's current position is blocked. But pushing the boulder south would require the agent to be behind it.

Wait, the agent is at (39,15), the boulder is at (40,15). To push the boulder south, the agent needs to move into the boulder's position (40,15) and then move south. So the agent would first move east to (40,15), then move south to (40,16), pushing the boulder to (41,15). But if there's a bar at (41,15), that wouldn't work.

The language observation says the boulder is very near east, which is (40,15). The bars very near include southsoutheast, south, etc. So pushing the boulder south might be possible if there's no bar at (41,15).

Alternatively, maybe the agent can move north, but that's blocked by bars.

Given the uncertainty, the safest action might be to attempt pushing the boulder south again, assuming the path is clear. Alternatively, move the agent to the southwest of the boulder to push it southeast.

But given the previous failures, perhaps the correct action is to try moving the boulder south once more, as the agent might have missed a clear path earlier.

Let's see. The goal is to push boulders onto fountains in Boxoban. The agent is a knight in a grid-like environment. From the observations, there are several boulders and fountains around.

Looking at the map, the agent is at (39,15). There's a boulder very near east and a fountain very near eastsoutheast. So the east direction has a boulder that needs to be moved towards the fountain. But there are bars and dark areas that might block the path. 

Previously, the agent tried moving east multiple times but got messages that either the boulder couldn't be moved or there were obstacles. The last message was ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain,"" which suggests that the agent is trying to push a boulder but can't because it's blocked or there's something in the way.

The cursor shows the knight's position, and the boulder is adjacent to the south and southwest. Wait, the language observation mentions a boulder adjacent south and southwest. So the boulder is to the south or southwest of the agent. But the agent's current position is (39,15). If the boulder is adjacent south, that would be (39,16). Looking at the map, the line for y=16 has the agent's position at <..``@.{#>, which might indicate the agent is at (39,16)? Wait, maybe the map's coordinates are different. Let me check the cursor again. The cursor says (x=39, y=15), so the agent is at that position. The map's ninth line (since y starts at 0?) might correspond to y=15. In the map, the line for y=15 is ""#....@.`.#"", which has the agent (@) at position (39,15). The next line (y=16) is ""#<..``{.{#"", which might have a boulder (<) at (40,16). But the agent is at (39,15), so moving south would take them to (39,16), which has a boulder adjacent? Wait, the language observation says the boulder is adjacent south and southwest. So from the agent's position (39,15), moving south to (39,16) would be next to the boulder. But the map shows a < at (40,16), which is east of the agent's current position. Maybe I'm getting the coordinates mixed up.

Alternatively, perhaps the boulder is to the southeast or south of the agent. The language observation mentions ""boulder adjacent south and southwest"". So if the agent is at (39,15), moving south to (39,16) would have the boulder there. But in the map, the line for y=16 is ""#<..``{.{#"", which has a < (boulder) at position 40,16. So that's east of the agent's current position. Maybe the coordinates are such that each character position is a tile, and the agent's x=39, y=15 is at position (39,15) in the grid. The boulder at (40,16) is to the southeast of the agent. So to reach it, the agent needs to move east then south, or south then east. But there are bars and dark areas blocking the way.

The agent tried moving east multiple times but ended up at x=40, y=15, but then couldn't move further east because of bars. Now the agent is back at x=39, y=15. The message about the boulder being adjacent south and southwest suggests that the boulder is near the agent's current position. Maybe the agent needs to move south to get next to the boulder and push it. But the map shows that moving south from (39,15) would go to (39,16), which has a boulder at (40,16). So perhaps the agent needs to go east once more to get next to the boulder, but there's a bar blocking that. Earlier attempts to move east resulted in ""You cannot pass through the bars."" So the bars are blocking the path east.

Looking at the language observation, there are bars very near north, northnortheast, etc., and bars adjacent southeast, south, and southwest. So the agent's current position (39,15) has bars to the southeast, south, and southwest. That means moving in those directions is blocked by bars. The agent needs to find a way around the bars to reach the boulder.

Alternatively, maybe the agent should move west to get a different angle. But moving west from (39,15) would go to (38,15), which might have bars or other obstacles. The previous attempts to move west resulted in the same issue.

Another approach: since the goal is to push the boulder onto the fountain eastsoutheast, perhaps the agent should navigate around the bars to get to a position where they can push the boulder towards the fountain. The stairs up are westsouthwest, which might not be useful right now. The priority is to interact with the boulder. 

Given that moving east is blocked by bars, the agent might need to move south first. From (39,15) moving south to (39,16). But the map shows at y=16, x=39 is a . (floor), and x=40 is < (boulder). So moving south to (39,16) is possible, and then from there, move east to reach the boulder. However, there's a bar adjacent southeast, south, and southwest. At (39,15), moving south to (39,16) is allowed if there's no bar there. The map line for y=16 is ""#<..``{.{#"", which at x=39 is a ., so it's passable. Then at (40,16) is the boulder. So the path east from (39,16) to (40,16) would hit the boulder. But to push the boulder, the agent needs to be adjacent to it and move in the direction opposite to where the boulder is. Wait, to push a boulder, the agent must move into it, and there must be an empty space behind the boulder. 

So if the agent is at (39,16), next to the boulder at (40,16), they could move east into the boulder, but only if the space behind the boulder (41,16) is free. Looking at the map, the line for y=16 ends with ""#<..``{.{#"", which at x=40 is the boulder, and beyond that, it's part of the ########## wall. So the space behind the boulder is blocked by a wall. Therefore, the agent cannot push the boulder east because there's no space behind it. 

In that case, the agent should look for another direction to push the boulder. Since the boulder is at (40,16), perhaps moving it south or west. But from (40,16), the agent would need to be adjacent and push. The agent is currently at (39,15). To get to (40,16), the agent would need to move south to (39,16), then east to (40,16). But as established, pushing east is blocked. 

Alternatively, maybe the boulder can be pushed north. From (40,16), pushing north to (40,15). But the agent is at (39,15). If the agent moves south to (39,16), then east to (40,16), then north to push the boulder to (40,15). But is (40,15) a valid space? Looking at the map for y=15, the line is ""#....@.`.#"", which at x=40 is a . (floor). So yes, (40,15) is free. Therefore, the agent could move to (40,16), then push the boulder north to (40,15). 

But how to get to (40,16) without being blocked. The bars adjacent southeast, south, and southwest at (39,15) might block moving southeast. So the agent should move south to (39,16), which is a floor, then east to (40,16), which is the boulder. Then move north from there to push the boulder to (40,15). 

So the sequence would be: south, east, north. But need to check if moving east from (39,16) to (40,16) is possible. The boulder is at (40,16), so the agent can move into it if there's space behind. Since behind the boulder (41,16) is a wall, pushing north would place the boulder at (40,15), which is free. 

Therefore, the agent should move south to (39,16), then east to (40,16), then north to push the boulder to (40,15). This would get the boulder closer to the fountain at eastsoutheast. 

But in the current observation, the agent is at (39,15). So the first action should be south to reach (39,16). Let's check if that's possible. The language observation says bars adjacent southeast, south, and southwest. At (39,15), moving south to (39,16) is allowed if there's no bar there. The map shows at y=16, x=39 is a ., so it's passable. 

So the next action should be south to get to (39,16), then east to reach the boulder, then north to push it. However, the agent needs to execute these steps. But the problem is that the user is asking for the next action based on the current observation. The current observation is that the agent is at (39,15) and the last action was south, which resulted in the message about the boulder being adjacent. 

Wait, the latest observation after the previous south action was the same as before, with the message ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" That suggests that the agent tried to push the boulder but couldn't. Maybe because they weren't adjacent to it. 

Looking back, the agent is at (39,15), and the boulder is adjacent south and southwest. So the boulder could be at (39,16) (south) or (38,15) (southwest). If the boulder is at (39,16), then the agent can move south into it. But the map shows at (39,16) there's a ., and the boulder is at (40,16). So perhaps the boulder is to the southeast. 

This is a bit confusing. Maybe the best approach is to move in a direction that gets closer to the boulder. Since the boulder is adjacent south and southwest, moving southwest might reach it. But the agent's position is (39,15). Southwest would be (38,16). Checking the map, y=16, x=38 is a ` (which might be a floor or another feature). But the bars adjacent southeast, south, and southwest at (39,15) might block moving southwest. 

Alternatively, moving west to (38,15) might be possible if there's no bar. The language observation says bars are adjacent southeast, south, and southwest, not west. So moving west could be possible. From (39,15) moving west to (38,15), which is a . on the map. Then from there, check the surroundings. 

But the goal is to get to the boulder. Maybe the agent should move east once more, but earlier attempts were blocked by bars. The language observation mentions bars very near north, eastsoutheast, westsouthwest, etc. So moving east from (39,15) to (40,15) is blocked by a bar. 

In this case, the agent might be stuck. The only free paths are south and west. Moving south to (39,16) is possible, then from there east to (40,16) where the boulder is. Then, push the boulder north to (40,15). 

So the next action should be south to move to (39,16).

Let's see. The agent is trying to navigate this Boxoban map. The goal is to push the boulders onto the fountains. The current position is at (39,15). The last few actions tried were moving west, south, etc., but the boulder isn't moving because there might be something blocking it or the agent isn't positioned correctly to push it.

Looking at the map, the boulder adjacent to the agent is to the southeast. The agent is at (39,15), and the boulder is very near eastsoutheast. So maybe the boulder is at (40,15) or (39,16). The agent tried moving west multiple times but the boulder wasn't moving. Wait, the message says ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" So when the agent tried to push it west, perhaps there's an obstacle behind the boulder, like a bar or another boulder.

Looking at the language observation, there are bars adjacent to the north, northeast, and northwest. The bars are very near various directions. The boulder adjacent southeast and northwest. So the boulder the agent is trying to push might be in the southeast direction, blocked by bars or another obstacle.

The agent might need to reposition to the side of the boulder so they can push it in the right direction. For example, if the boulder is at (40,15), and there's a bar to the north, the agent could move south to get behind the boulder and push it east towards the fountain at eastsoutheast.

Alternatively, the agent might need to check if there's a clear path behind the boulder. The message about the boulder not moving suggests that there's something blocking it. Since the agent is at (39,15), trying to push east might not work if there's a bar or another boulder to the east. Maybe the agent should try moving south to get a better angle, or check north for any obstacles.

Another possibility is that the boulder is already next to a fountain, but the agent isn't seeing it. The fountain is very near eastsoutheast, so perhaps the boulder is already there, but the agent needs to confirm. However, the previous actions didn't indicate success, so probably the boulder isn't in position yet.

The agent's inventory has a lot of items, but pushing the boulder likely doesn't require special items. It's more about movement. The agent should try to find a path around the bars to reposition. Maybe moving south to (39,16) where there's a stairs up near westsouthwest, but that might not help. Alternatively, moving northeast to avoid the bars and get to the side of the boulder.

Wait, the bars adjacent are north, northeast, and northwest. So the agent is surrounded on those sides. The only clear directions might be east and south. But pushing east wasn't successful before. Maybe the agent needs to move south first to (39,16), then see if they can push the boulder east from there. Or check if moving northeast is possible.

Alternatively, since the boulder is adjacent southeast, the agent should position themselves to the north or west of the boulder to push it. If the boulder is at (40,15), then the agent is at (39,15). To push it east, the agent needs to be to the west of the boulder. But the agent is already west of it. So why isn't it moving? Maybe there's a bar to the east of the boulder. Looking at the map, the bars are very near north, eastsoutheast, etc. So east of the boulder might have a bar, preventing it from being pushed further east.

In that case, the agent should try to push the boulder in another direction, like south. If the boulder is at (40,15), pushing it south to (40,16) might be possible if there's no obstacle. But the agent needs to check the map for obstacles in that direction. The map shows stairs up near westsouthwest, which might be at (38,16) or similar. The agent's current position is (39,15), so moving south to (39,16) is possible if there's no barrier.

Looking at the language observation, the bars adjacent are southeast, south, and southwest. So moving south from (39,15) to (39,16) might be blocked by a bar. The message says ""You cannot pass through the bars."" So that direction is blocked. The agent might need to find another path.

Perhaps moving west again, but that didn't work. Or trying to move north, but there are bars there. Maybe the agent needs to look for a different boulder or check if there are multiple boulders. However, the current observations mention a boulder very near eastsoutheast and another adjacent southeast.

Another approach is to use the inventory items. The agent has a +1 long sword and a lance, but using them to push a boulder isn't necessary. The key is movement. Since pushing east isn't working, maybe the agent should move around the boulder to the north or west. But the bars are blocking those sides.

Alternatively, the agent could pick up the boulder, but in Boxoban, you push boulders by walking into them, not picking them up. So the agent needs to position correctly.

Given the current position and the obstacles, perhaps the best action is to move south to see if there's a clear path. But the previous attempt to move south resulted in an error message. Alternatively, move northeast to get around the bars. However, the bars are adjacent to the northeast, so that might not be possible.

Wait, the bars adjacent are north, northeast, and northwest. So the agent is at (39,15) with bars to the north, northeast, and northwest. The boulder is to the southeast. So the agent is between the bars and the boulder. To push the boulder east, the agent needs to be to the west of it. They are already there, but maybe the path is blocked by a bar east of the boulder.

In that case, the agent might need to move the boulder south first, towards the fountain. So from (40,15), pushing it south to (40,16). But the agent is at (39,15), so to push the boulder south, the agent would need to move to the west of the boulder and then push. However, the agent is already west of the boulder. Maybe the barrier is to the east of the boulder, preventing it from moving further east, but south might be possible.

The agent should try pushing the boulder south. To do that, they need to be adjacent to it and move in the direction they want to push. Since the boulder is at (40,15), the agent is at (39,15). To push it south, the agent would move south, but the boulder would move to (40,16). However, there might be a bar at (40,16), blocking that movement.

Looking at the language observation, the bars very near include southsoutheast and south. So (40,16) might have a bar. If so, the boulder can't be pushed there. Then the agent might need to try pushing the boulder in another direction, like west. But the agent is already trying to push west and it's not working.

Alternatively, maybe the agent should move to the northwest of the boulder to push it north, but that's blocked by bars.

This is tricky. The agent might be stuck because the boulder is trapped between bars and other obstacles. The only possible move might be to find a way around the bars to reposition. Since the agent is at (39,15), perhaps moving east to (40,15) where the boulder is, but that's probably blocked by the boulder itself. Or moving north around the bar, but there's a bar there.

Wait, the agent can't pass through bars, so moving north would hit a bar. The same with northwest. So the only possible directions are east, south, and southeast. But pushing east isn't working, and moving south is blocked.

Perhaps the agent needs to use the stairs up near westsouthwest to go down a level, but that's probably not helpful here. The goal is to push the boulder onto the fountain, which is eastsoutheast. The agent needs to get the boulder there.

Another idea: the boulder very near westnorthwest. Maybe that's another boulder that needs to be moved. But the agent's current focus is on the southeast boulder.

Alternatively, the agent might need to check if the fountain is accessible. The fountain is very near eastsoutheast, so perhaps moving the boulder there requires a different path.

In summary, the agent is stuck trying to push the boulder east because there's a barrier. They need to find an alternative path to move the boulder south or west, but those directions are also blocked. The only possible move might be to move around the bars to the northeast or southwest, but those are adjacent.

Given the constraints, the best action might be to move south again, even if it's blocked, to see if there's a different observation. Or try moving northeast to get around the bars. But based on previous attempts, moving south resulted in an error. Alternatively, the agent could try moving west again, but that didn't work.

Wait, maybe the agent needs to move to the exact position of the boulder to push it. If the boulder is at (40,15), the agent is at (39,15). To push it east, the agent would need to move east into the boulder, which would push it to (41,15). But if there's a bar at (41,15), that's not possible. The agent should check if the path is clear.

Looking at the map, the east area near (41,15) is dark, but there might be bars. The language observation mentions bars very near southeast, southsoutheast, etc. So pushing the boulder east might not be possible.

Given all this, the safest bet is to reposition the agent to the side of the boulder where there's no obstruction. Since the agent is at (39,15), and the boulder is at (40,15), moving north to (39,14) might be possible if there's no bar. But the language observation says bars are adjacent north, so moving north would hit a bar.

Therefore, the only possible valid move might be to move east into the boulder, even if it's blocked. But the previous attempts didn't work. Alternatively, the agent could use a different action, like picking up an item, but that's not relevant here.

After considering all options, the next logical action is to try pushing the boulder in a different direction, perhaps south, even though it's blocked, to see if the agent can find a way around. Alternatively, move west again, but that didn't work. Maybe the agent needs to look for a different boulder or check if there's a way to remove the bars, but in Boxoban, bars are static obstacles.

In this case, the best action the agent can take is to move east again, even though it failed before, in case the environment has changed. Or perhaps move south to (39,16) to see if there's a clear path. But the previous south move resulted in an error, so maybe that's blocked by a bar.

Given the lack of clear options, the agent might have to try moving east once more, hoping that the boulder can be pushed this time, or find another way around.

",-0.001,False
37,north,"<reasoning>
I need to figure out the next move here. Let's look at the current state. The agent is at position (40, 15). There's a boulder very near westsouthwest, which probably means it's somewhere to the west side. The fountains are near eastsoutheast, so the goal is to push the boulder there.

Looking at the map, the agent is facing east, and to the east there's a boulder adjacent southeast and northwest. Wait, the cursor shows the agent as '@', and the map shows '#<..``{.{#' near the bottom. The '<' might be the agent's position. The boulder is very near eastsoutheast and westnorthwest in the language observations. 

The agent tried moving east multiple times before but kept getting a ""You cannot pass through the bars"" message. That means there are bars blocking the path east. The bars are adjacent north and northeast, so maybe the agent is next to a bar to the north or northeast. The recent observations mention bars very near north, northnortheast, etc. 

The agent is trying to get to the boulder at westsouthwest to push it towards the fountain at eastsoutheast. The stairs up are near westsouthwest, so maybe the boulder is there. But the agent is at (40,15), and the boulder is very near westsouthwest. Let's check the coordinates. If the boulder is westsouthwest of the agent, that would be moving west and south. 

But the agent tried moving west before and got a message about trying to move the boulder, but in vain. Wait, when the agent moved west, the message said ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" That suggests that there's a boulder adjacent to the agent when trying to move west. Looking at the latest observation, the boulder is adjacent southeast and northwest. So if the agent is facing east, moving west would take them towards northwest, which has a boulder adjacent. Therefore, moving west would try to push that boulder, but there's something blocking its path.

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to move around the bars. The bars are adjacent north and northeast. So the agent is north of a bar, perhaps. The agent needs to find a way to navigate around the bars to reach the boulder. 

Another approach: the fountain is at eastsoutheast. The agent is at (40,15). To reach the fountain, they need to go southeast. But there are bars very near eastsoutheast. Maybe the boulder is between the agent and the fountain. The boulder at westsouthwest is near the stairs up. So perhaps the correct strategy is to move towards the boulder at westsouthwest, push it east towards the fountain.

But the agent is currently at (40,15). To get to westsouthwest, which would be southwest direction. But the agent tried moving south before and got a message about bars. Let's check the latest observation: moving south results in ""You cannot pass through the bars."" The bars are adjacent south and southwest. So the agent is south of a bar, perhaps. 

Alternatively, the agent needs to move north to get around the bars. The bars are adjacent north and northeast. If the agent moves north, they might clear a path. Then from there, move west towards the boulder. 

Wait, the latest language observation says bars adjacent north and northwest. So if the agent is at (40,15), moving north would take them into the area with bars adjacent. But moving north might not be blocked if there's a path. Let me visualize the map. The map shows the agent's position with '#<..``{.{#', which might indicate the agent is in a corridor with walls (bars) around. 

Alternatively, the agent should push the boulder to the southeast. The boulder is at westsouthwest, so pushing it east would move it towards the fountain. But to push it, the agent needs to be adjacent to it and move in the direction opposite to where they want to push. For example, to push a boulder east, the agent needs to move west into it. 

The agent is at (40,15), and the boulder is very near westsouthwest. So the boulder's position would be southwest of the agent. To push it east, the agent needs to move west towards the boulder, then push it east. But when the agent tried moving west before, they got a message that they couldn't move the boulder because it's blocked. So maybe there's another obstacle behind the boulder. 

Looking at the latest observation, the boulder adjacent southeast and northwest. Wait, the agent's position is (40,15). If the boulder is adjacent southeast, that would be to the southeast of the agent. But the fountain is at eastsoutheast, so maybe that boulder is the one to push. But then why is it adjacent southeast? That would mean the boulder is to the southeast of the agent. 

Wait, the language observation says ""boulder very near eastsoutheast"" and ""boulder adjacent southeast and northwest."" So the boulder adjacent southeast is near the agent's current position. So the agent is at (40,15), and the boulder is to the southeast. That would be position (41,16) or similar. But the agent tried moving east and got blocked by bars. 

Hmm, maybe the boulder is between the agent and the bars. The agent needs to push the boulder past the bars. But the bars are blocking the path. So the agent must first move around the bars to get a clear path to push the boulder. 

Alternatively, the agent should move northeast to avoid the bars. The bars are adjacent north and northwest, so moving northeast might take them into an area without bars. Then from there, move southeast towards the fountain. 

But I need to check the possible actions. The allowed actions are north, east, south, west. So the agent can only move in these directions. 

Given that the agent is at (40,15), and the boulder is adjacent southeast, perhaps the agent should move east to get next to the boulder. But moving east was previously blocked by bars. Wait, in the earlier steps, moving east resulted in ""You cannot pass through the bars."" So the path east is blocked by bars. Therefore, the agent cannot move east directly. 

Therefore, to reach the boulder, the agent needs to navigate around the bars. Since the bars are adjacent north and northwest, moving north might be possible if there's a passage. Let's see: the latest observation says bars adjacent north and northwest. So if the agent moves north, they might enter a corridor with bars on the north and northwest sides. But perhaps there's a way through. 

Alternatively, moving west might lead to the boulder, but earlier attempts to move west resulted in trying to move the boulder which was blocked. So maybe the agent needs to move west and then north or south to position themselves to push the boulder. 

Wait, the boulder is adjacent southeast and northwest. If the agent moves west, they would be moving towards the northwest adjacent boulder. But the message says ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain,"" which means there's something blocking the boulder's movement. Perhaps another obstacle behind it. 

Given all this, perhaps the best approach is to move north to get around the blocking bars and then find a way to the boulder. Alternatively, move southwest to reach the boulder at westsouthwest. But the agent's current position is (40,15), and southwest would be decreasing x and y. 

Alternatively, the agent should move south to see if that clears a path. But moving south was previously blocked by bars. 

Hmm, maybe the agent needs to push the boulder first. If the boulder is adjacent southeast, the agent needs to move west into it to push it east. But moving west would require the boulder to be in the west direction. Wait, adjacent southeast means the boulder is to the southeast of the agent. So the agent is at (40,15), and the boulder is at (41,16) or (41,15). To push it east, the agent needs to move west into it, but that might not be possible if there's a barrier. 

Alternatively, maybe the boulder is at (39,15), which is northwest of the agent. Then pushing it east would require the agent to move west into it. That makes sense. If the boulder is adjacent northwest, then moving west into it would push it east. 

In the latest observation, the boulder is adjacent southeast and northwest. So if the agent moves west, they would be next to the northwest boulder. Then pushing it east by moving west into it. But when the agent tried moving west before, they got a message saying they couldn't move the boulder because it's blocked. So perhaps there's another obstacle behind the boulder. 

The agent's inventory has a long sword and a lance, but nokeys or other items that might help remove obstacles. Since it's a box-pushing game, the solution is to push boulders to fountains. 

Given that, the agent needs to find a path to the boulder, avoid bars, and push it towards the fountain. 

Given the agent's current position and the adjacent blocks, the best move might be to move north to avoid the bars blocking the north and northwest, then proceed west to reach the boulder. 

So the chosen action is north.

Let's see. The agent is in MiniHack/Boxoban. The goal is to push all the boulders onto the fountains. From the previous observations, there's a boulder near the east and another very near eastsoutheast. The fountains are in eastsoutheast and southeast. The agent is at (40,15) facing east, with a boulder adjacent to the southeast and northwest.

The bars are blocking movement north, northeast, and northwest. The stairs are up westsouthwest, so maybe that's an exit, but the main goal is the boulders and fountains. The agent tried moving east multiple times but kept hitting bars or boulders. When they tried pushing west, the boulder wouldn't move. So maybe they need to navigate around the bars and boulders to get to the fountains.

Looking at the map, the agent is near a boulder at (39,15) to the west. Since pushing the boulder there didn't work, maybe they need to move south to get around? But the bars are blocking south as well. Alternatively, maybe move east past the bars? But east is blocked by bars. Wait, the map shows the agent's position as { in (40,15). The boulder is at (39,15) southeast? Or maybe the boulder is at (40,16)? The map isn't very clear, but the observations mention boulders adjacent southeast and northwest.

I should try to move around the boulder. Since pushing west didn't work, maybe move south and then try pushing the boulder in another direction. But the bars are blocking south. Alternatively, move east and find a way to push the boulder into the fountain. But east is blocked by bars. Maybe go west to the boulder at (39,15) and try pushing it south into the fountain. But how?

Wait, the agent's last action was north, back to (40,15). The boulder adjacent southeast and northwest. So the boulder to the southeast is at (41,15), and northwest at (39,15). The agent is at (40,15). To push the southeast boulder, they need to move south into it. But the bars are blocking south. Hmm. Maybe the agent needs to go around the bars to the westsouthwest stairs, but that's probably not helpful. Alternatively, find a path through the dark areas.

Alternatively, maybe the agent should go south into a dark area and find another way. But the last observation said when moving south, it's blocked by bars. So perhaps the best move is to try pushing the boulder to the east. The boulder is at (40,15) adjacent southeast, so maybe it's at (41,15). If the agent moves east to (41,15) and then tries to push the boulder south into the fountain. But to get to (41,15), they need to move east, but east is blocked by bars. Wait, previous moves showed that moving east from (40,15) was allowed until they hit a boulder. Wait, in the earlier steps, moving east multiple times got them to (40,15), (41,15), etc., but then hitting bars. Now, the agent is back at (40,15), and the boulder is adjacent southeast. Maybe the agent can move east into the boulder and push it south.

Wait, the message when trying to move west into the boulder said ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" So that means the boulder is blocked. Maybe the boulder is blocked by another obstacle. So the agent needs to find a way to unblock it. Alternatively, push the boulder in a direction where there's space. For example, push the boulder at (40,15) southeast (which is (41,15)) by moving east and then pushing it south. But to do that, the agent needs to move east into (41,15), which is the boulder's position. Then, if they move south while holding the boulder, it would push the boulder south. But is there space south of (41,15)?

Looking at the map, the fountain is very near eastsoutheast, which might be (42,16) or similar. If the agent can get the boulder to that area, they can push it onto the fountain. So the plan is: move east into the boulder at (41,15), then push it south towards the fountain. But first, check if moving east from (40,15) is possible. Earlier attempts to move east were allowed until they hit a bar. Wait, in the history, moving east from (37,15) to (40,15) was possible, but then further east was blocked by bars. So now, the agent is at (40,15), and moving east would take them to (41,15), which is a boulder. So action 'east' would try to push the boulder. If that's possible, then the agent can proceed.

But when the agent tried moving west into the boulder earlier, it didn't work. But maybe moving east into the boulder works. Let's try 'east' again. If that's successful, then the boulder would move to (41,16), and the agent would be on the boulder. Then, moving south could push it further. But need to check if there's space. Alternatively, maybe the agent should move south first to see if that's possible.

Alternatively, the agent could try to move south into a dark area, but the last observation said moving south was blocked by bars. So the best bet is to try pushing the boulder to the east. So action 'east' again.

Let's try to figure out what the agent needs to do next. The goal in Boxoban is to push all the boulders onto the fountains. From the current observation, the agent is at position (41, 15) and has just moved a boulder east to (41,15), probably pushing it there.

Looking at the language observations, there's a boulder very near westsouthwest, which might be the one that was just moved. The fountain is very near west, so maybe the boulder was pushed towards that direction. But I need to check the map layout. 

In the map, after moving east, the agent's position is marked with @, and the boulder is now adjacent east. The fountain is adjacent southeast and southwest. The bars are all around the north and some other directions. The stairs up are far westsouthwest, so probably not relevant right now.

The agent just pushed the boulder east, so the next step is likely to continue pushing it towards the fountain. Since the boulder is adjacent east now, the agent can push it further east if there's no obstacle. The message says the boulder was moved successfully, so the path east should be clear. 

The agent's current position is (41,15), and the boulder is adjacent east. To push the boulder east, the agent needs to move east again. But wait, when you push a boulder, you have to move in the same direction as the boulder. So if the agent is at (41,15) and the boulder is at (42,15), moving east would push the boulder to (43,15), provided there's space. 

Looking at the map, after the update, the agent's new position is shown with @ at (41,15), and the boulder's position isn't explicitly on the map but is mentioned as adjacent east. So moving east again should work. 

But I need to make sure there's no obstacle behind the boulder. The observation mentions bars very near in various directions, but specifically, the bars adjacent are northwest. So east direction should be clear. 

The agent's inventory has a good set of equipment, but that's probably not needed right now. The priority is to keep pushing the boulder towards the fountain. The fountain is adjacent southeast and southwest, so maybe after pushing the boulder east a few more times, it can reach the southeast fountain. 

Alternatively, maybe the boulder is now in a position where it can be pushed south or southeast towards the fountain. But according to the current observations, the fountain is adjacent southeast and southwest. If the boulder is east of the agent, then moving south might not be the right direction. 

So the best next action is to move east again to push the boulder further towards the fountain. Let's confirm that there's no obstacle in the way. The language observation says the boulder is adjacent east, and the bars are adjacent northwest, so moving east should be possible. 

Therefore, the action should be east.

The goal is to push boulders onto fountains. I need to figure out where the boulders and fountains are located based on the observations.

Looking at the language observations, there's a boulder very near westsouthwest, and another one adjacent to the east. The fountain is adjacent to the southeast and southwest. The map shows the agent is at (41,15). The previous actions were moving east multiple times, but the last attempt to push the boulder failed. 

Wait, the latest message says ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" That probably means there's something blocking the boulder's path. The boulder adjacent to the east (which is where the agent is now at x=41) might have an obstacle behind it. The agent needs to check if there's a way to move the boulder by perhaps moving in another direction first. 

Looking at the map, the agent's current position is marked with @, and there's a boulder with {. The fountain is near southeast and southwest. The bars might represent walls or obstacles. The agent tried moving south, west, north, but the boulder won't budge. Maybe the boulder is stuck against another obstacle. 

The agent needs to approach the boulder from the correct direction. If the boulder is at (40,15), then pushing east would move it towards the fountain at (41,15) adjacent southeast. But since moving the boulder failed, perhaps there's a wall or another boulder in the way. Let me check the adjacent areas. 

The bars adjacent to the northwest might be blocking the path. The agent should try moving north or west to position themselves correctly. Alternatively, check if there's a way to push the boulder by moving it west first. 

Wait, the boulder adjacent east is at (41,15), which is where the agent is. So trying to push it further east isn't possible. Maybe the agent should try moving the boulder north or south. But the agent's cursor is at (41,15), and the boulder is adjacent east. Maybe the boulder is at (42,15), and pushing it would require moving east, but that's blocked. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to move around the boulder. Since the agent is at (41,15), and the boulder is east of them, perhaps moving north or south to get a better angle. But the latest observation says the boulder is adjacent east, so it's right next to the agent. 

The message about moving the boulder failing suggests that there's something behind it. Maybe another boulder or a wall. The agent should check the area behind the boulder. Since the agent is east of the boulder, pushing it east would require the path to be clear. If there's a bar (wall) to the east of the boulder, then pushing it isn't possible. 

In that case, the agent might need to move north or south to see if there's a way to push the boulder around the barrier. Alternatively, check if there's another boulder that needs to be moved first. 

Looking at the language observations, there's a boulder very near westsouthwest, which is further away. Maybe the agent needs to handle that one first. But the current adjacent boulder is east. 

Hmm. The agent should try a different direction. Let's see. The possible actions are north, east, south, west. The agent was moving east, but that's not working. Maybe try moving north to see if there's a path. 

Alternatively, check if the fountain is in a direction that the boulder can be pushed towards. The fountain is adjacent southeast and southwest. So if the boulder at (41,15) is pushed east, it would go to (42,15), which is southeast of the agent. If that's a fountain, then pushing it there would solve the problem. But why can't the agent push it? 

The error message says ""in vain,"" so maybe there's an obstacle. The bars adjacent northwest might be a wall blocking the path. If the agent moves north, they could get around the barrier. 

So next move: north. Let's try moving north to see if that allows pushing the boulder.

Let's see. The goal is to push the boulder onto the fountain. From the current observation, the boulder is at westnorthwest, but there's also a boulder very near westsouthwest. The agent is at (41,15), and the map shows some bars and fountains.

Looking at the last move, I pushed the boulder east to (41,15), but then couldn't move it again. Now, the boulder adjacent to east. The fountain is near eastsoutheast, but the most recent observation mentions fountains very near southsoutheast, southsouthwest, and westsouthwest. Hmm.

Wait, the message says ""With great effort you move the boulder"" when moving east to (41,15). Now, the boulder is adjacent to east. The agent is at (41,15). The fountain is very near southsoutheast. So maybe I need to move the boulder towards that fountain.

But the current position of the boulder is at westsouthwest? Wait, no. The latest observation after pushing east says the boulder adjacent east. So the boulder is now next to the agent's current position (41,15). The agent is at (41,15), and the boulder is adjacent east. So the boulder is at (42,15).

To push the boulder further east towards the fountain, the agent needs to move east again. But earlier attempts to move east resulted in ""in vain"" because maybe there's an obstacle. Wait, the latest observation after moving east said the boulder moved, so now it's adjacent east. So maybe the agent can push it again if there's space beyond.

Looking at the map, the agent is at (41,15), and the map shows a '#' which might be a wall or bar. The bars very near include north, northeast, east, etc. So moving east from (41,15) might hit a bar. But the boulder is now at (42,15). To push it east, the agent needs to move into the boulder's tile, which would push it further east if the path is clear.

Wait, the message after moving east previously said ""With great effort you move the boulder,"" implying that the path was clear at that time. Now, after moving north to (41,14), the agent is one tile north. The boulder is adjacent east at (42,15). The agent is at (41,14), which is north of the boulder. To push the boulder east, the agent needs to move east into the boulder's tile. But since the agent is at (41,14), moving east would take them to (42,14), which is northeast of the boulder. That might not push the boulder east. 

Wait, maybe the agent needs to be adjacent to the boulder in the correct direction. The boulder is at (42,15), and the agent is at (41,14). To push it east, the agent should move east to (42,14), which is north of the boulder. Then, moving east again into the boulder's tile (42,15) would push it to (43,15). But the map shows bars in that area. Let me check the map again.

The map shows at position (x=41, y=14) as part of the agent's location. The line for y=15 has `#<..``{.{#`, which might indicate the boulder's position. But the exact map layout is a bit unclear. Alternatively, perhaps the agent needs to move south back to (41,15) to be adjacent east to the boulder, then push it east towards the fountain.

Looking at the cursor position now is (41,14). Moving south would bring the agent back to (41,15), adjacent to the boulder at (42,15). Then, moving east into (42,15) would push the boulder to (43,15). If there's a clear path east from there, towards the fountain in the southeast, that could work. But the language observation mentions bars adjacent north, northeast, west, and northwest at (41,14). So moving east from (41,14) might hit a bar. 

Alternatively, after moving north to (41,14), perhaps moving south back to (41,15) and then east to push the boulder. The key is to get the agent adjacent to the boulder in the correct direction. Since the boulder is now at (42,15), the agent should be at (42,14) or (41,15) to push it east. But the agent is at (41,14), so moving south to (41,15) first, then east into (42,15) to push it to (43,15). 

The fountain is near eastsoutheast, which would be towards the southeast direction. So after pushing the boulder east twice, it should reach the fountain. But need to check for obstacles. The latest language observation says bars adjacent north, northeast, west, and northwest at (41,14). So moving east from (41,14) might be blocked by bars. Therefore, the agent should first move south to (41,15) to be adjacent to the boulder, then east. 

So the steps would be: move south to (41,15), then east to push the boulder to (43,15). Then check if that's towards the fountain. Alternatively, if moving east from (41,15) is blocked by bars, need to find another path. 

Given that the previous move east succeeded, perhaps the path is now clear. Let me think again. After pushing the boulder to (41,15), the agent was at (40,15). Then moving north to (40,16), then west back to (39,15), etc. Now, after moving north to (41,14), the agent is one step north. The boulder is at (42,15). So to push it east, the agent needs to be at (42,14) or (41,15). Since the agent is at (41,14), moving south to (41,15) makes sense. Then move east into the boulder's tile, which would push it to (43,15). If that's towards the fountain, then that's the correct action. 

Therefore, the next actions should be south to get adjacent, then east to push the boulder. But the user is asking for the next action based on the current observation where the agent is at (41,14). So the immediate next step is to move south to (41,15) to be adjacent to the boulder, allowing a push east. However, the user's history shows that after moving east, the agent's position was (41,15), and then subsequent moves tried to push again but failed. Maybe the path is now blocked. 

Alternatively, perhaps the agent should check the surroundings. But the instruction says to avoid repeating the same action if nothing changes. Since the agent is at (41,14), and the boulder is at (42,15), moving south to (41,15) is necessary to interact with the boulder. Then, moving east to push it. So the next action should be south.

I need to figure out the next move in this Boxoban game. The agent is a knight trying to push boulders onto fountains. Let me look at the current state.

The map shows the agent's position at (41, 15). There's a boulder adjacent to the east and southwest. The fountains are south and west. The boulder to the east is right next to the agent, so maybe pushing it west towards the fountain would work. But wait, the boulder adjacent east—so if I move east, I might hit the boulder. But since I can push it, moving into the boulder would push it west. That direction has a fountain adjacent southwest, so that's probably the target.

Let me check the previous actions. The agent moved east a few times, tried to push but failed because the boulder wasn't in front. Then moved north, south, etc. Now the boulder is at (41,15) east, so pushing it west would move it to (40,15), which is towards the fountain west. 

I need to make sure there's no obstacle behind the boulder. The map shows bars and dark areas, but the adjacent squares west of the boulder should be clear if it's pushing towards the fountain. The last observation's message said ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain"" when trying to push east, so maybe the path was blocked. But now, if I push the eastern boulder west, that should work.

So the best action is to move east into the boulder, which will push it west towards the fountain. That should solve the level. Let's go with east.

Let me try to figure out how to solve this Boxoban problem. The goal is to push all the boulders onto the fountains. Looking at the current state, there's a boulder adjacent to the east and another one nearby. The player is at position (41, 15).

First, I need to check where the fountains are. The language observation mentions a fountain very near east and another adjacent to southeast and southwest. So, there's at least one fountain to the east, and possibly others nearby. The main boulder that was moved earlier is now at (41, 15), and there's another boulder very near westsouthwest. 

The player tried moving east multiple times but couldn't because the boulder is blocking. The message says ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" So, the boulder to the east is stuck, maybe because it's against a wall or another obstacle. 

Looking at the map, the player is near the edge, and the boulder adjacent east might be against a bar or another wall. The bars are mentioned in the language observation, which are obstacles. The bars very near north, northeast, etc., suggest that moving the boulder east might not be possible because there's a bar blocking the path.

The other boulder is at westsouthwest, which might be closer to a fountain. The fountain adjacent to northwest could be another target. Maybe pushing that boulder towards the northwest fountain would help. 

The player's current position is (41, 15). If they move west, they can get closer to the boulder at westnorthwest. Let me check the cursor position again. The player is at (41,15), and the boulder adjacent east is at (42,15). The bars are blocking the way east. So moving west might allow accessing the other boulder. 

Alternatively, moving north or south near the current position might reveal if there's a way to push the east boulder. But the previous attempts to move south didn't change anything. The bars might be solid walls. 

Another approach is to check if the boulder at westsouthwest can be moved towards the fountain. If the player moves west to (40,15), then they might be able to push the boulder westnorthwest further. But the current map shows the boulder at westnorthwest, which is probably near the player's initial position. 

Wait, the map shows at position (41,15) the player has a '@' symbol, and the boulder adjacent east is marked with '{'. The bars are all around, making it tricky. The stairs up are near westsouthwest, but that's probably a different area. 

Maybe the solution is to navigate to the boulder at westnorthwest and push it towards the fountain adjacent northwest. To do that, the player needs to move west from (41,15) to (40,15), then check if they can push the boulder west. 

Alternatively, moving north from (41,15) to (41,14) might reveal a path. But the previous move north didn't change the observation, suggesting there's a bar there. 

Another possibility is to check if the boulder at east can be pushed in a different direction. Since it's adjacent east, maybe moving the player north or south could allow a side push. For example, if the player moves north to (41,14), then tries to push the boulder east, but the bars might still block. 

But given the current observations, the most feasible move seems to be moving west to get closer to the other boulder and attempt to push it towards the fountain. Let's go with west as the next action.

Let's see. The goal is to push the boulder onto the fountains. From the observations, there are several boulders and fountains around. The last action was moving west to (40,15). The current map shows a boulder near westnorthwest, and fountains adjacent to southeast and west.

The agent is at (40,15). The boulder that was moved earlier is now at (41,15), but the last message said trying to move it again failed. Maybe there's another boulder. The map shows a boulder very near westsouthwest. Maybe that's the one to focus on.

Looking at the adjacent areas: to the south is a fountain. If I can push the boulder south towards the fountain, that would solve the level. The previous attempts to move the boulder east or south didn't work because it was blocked. Let me check the bars and obstacles. Bars are blocking certain directions, so I need to find a path where I can push the boulder.

The boulder at westsouthwest (probably around (39,15)) might be pushable. If I move west from (40,15) to (39,15), then try pushing the boulder southwest towards the fountain adjacent to west. Wait, the fountain is adjacent to west, so if the boulder is pushed west, it would reach the fountain.

But how to get to the boulder? The agent is at (40,15). Moving west once gets to (39,15), which is where the boulder is very near. Then, try pushing the boulder west. The message says ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain"" before, so maybe the direction was wrong. If the boulder is at (39,15), pushing it west would take it to (38,15), which should be adjacent to the fountain west. Let me confirm the fountain's position. The language observation says ""fountain adjacent west"", so the fountain is to the west of the agent's current position. So pushing the boulder west from (39,15) would place it at (38,15), which is on the fountain.

But why didn't previous attempts work? Maybe the boulder was blocked in another direction. Let me check the map again. The map shows at position (39,15) there's a boulder. The agent is at (40,15). If the agent moves west to (39,15), then tries to push the boulder west, that should work if there's space. The bars and other obstacles are in other directions. The bars very near include north, northeast, etc., but west might be clear.

So the plan is: move west to the boulder's position, then push it west towards the fountain. The previous actions tried pushing east or south, which might not be the right direction. Therefore, the next action should be west to get to the boulder, then push west. Since the last move was west and the agent is now at (40,15), moving west again to (39,15) where the boulder is located. Then, the action would be to push the boulder west.

Let's figure out what to do next in this Boxoban game. The goal is to push all the boulders onto the fountains. From the current observations, there's a boulder at (40,15) which is adjacent to southwest. The agent is at (40,15) as well. The map shows a fountain adjacent to south and west, so maybe one of the fountains is nearby.

First, I need to check if there's a boulder that needs to be moved. The previous messages indicated that trying to push a boulder sometimes fails if there's something blocking it. The last attempt to move the boulder east failed because it's stuck. 

Looking at the map, the agent is facing a boulder to the west (near westnorthwest). Wait, the current position is (40,15), and the boulder is adjacent southwest. So maybe the boulder is to the southwest of the agent. To push it southwest, the agent would need to move southwest and then push. But the agent's current position is at (40,15), and the cursor shows the knight's position there. 

The language observation mentions a boulder very near east and westsouthwest. So maybe the boulder to the east is at (41,15), which the agent previously tried to push but couldn't. The other boulder is at westsouthwest, which might be at (39,14) or similar. 

The fountains are adjacent to south and west, so perhaps the agent needs to move the boulder towards those areas. The agent is currently at (40,15). If there's a fountain to the south, pushing a boulder there would solve the level. 

But the agent can't move south because there are bars. The bars are blocking movement north as well. The agent tried moving north and got a message about bars. So movement is restricted in those directions. 

The available directions are west, east, south, north, but those are blocked by bars or obstacles. The only way to proceed is to push the boulder in a direction where there's space. Since the boulder is adjacent southwest, perhaps pushing it southwest would free up the agent's position. 

So the plan is to move the agent to a position where they can push the boulder southwest towards the fountain. The agent is at (40,15). To push the boulder southwest, the agent needs to be adjacent to it in that direction. The boulder's position is southwest of the agent, so the agent should move west to (39,15) and then push south. 

But the agent tried moving west earlier and couldn't because there was a boulder adjacent northeast and west. Wait, the current language observation says there's a boulder adjacent southwest. So the boulder is to the southwest of the agent. That means if the agent moves southwest, they can push it. 

But the agent's current position is (40,15). Moving southwest would take them to (39,14), which is where the boulder might be. Wait, the cursor shows the knight at (40,15), and the boulder is adjacent southwest. So the boulder is at (39,14). To push it there, the agent needs to move into that position first. 

So the steps would be: move west to (39,15), then move south to (39,14), and push the boulder southwest. But moving south from (39,15) would take the agent to (39,14), which is where the boulder is. Then pushing the boulder southwest would move it to (38,13), assuming there's no obstacle there. 

But need to check if there are obstacles behind the boulder. The message when trying to push earlier says ""in vain,"" which might mean there's something blocking. Looking at the map, there are bars very near north, northeast, etc., but maybe the path behind the boulder is clear. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent should try pushing the boulder in another direction. If the boulder is at (39,14), pushing it north to (39,15) would place it adjacent to the agent's current position, but that might not help. 

Another option is to check the fountain's location. The fountain is adjacent to south and west. If the agent can push the boulder west into the fountain, that would solve it. But the agent is at (40,15), so pushing the boulder west would require moving to (39,15) and then pushing west to (39,14). If the fountain is west of (39,14), that would work. 

Given that the previous attempts to move the boulder east failed, perhaps the correct approach is to push it west towards the fountain. So the agent needs to move west to (39,15), then south to (39,14), and push west. 

But the agent's current position is (40,15). Moving west to (39,15) is possible if there's no obstacle. The language observation mentions bars very near north, northeast, etc., but not specifically blocking movement west. The cursor shows the agent's position at (40,15), and the boulder is adjacent southwest. So moving west to (39,15) should be allowed. 

Once at (39,15), the agent can then move south to (39,14), where the boulder is, and push it west. If that works, the boulder would move to (38,13), potentially onto the fountain. 

So the sequence of actions would be: west, south, push west. 

But the user's previous actions were west, south, north, etc., leading to the current state. The agent needs to try pushing again in a different direction. 

Alternatively, maybe pushing the boulder east towards the fountain. The boulder is adjacent southwest, so pushing it east would move it to (41,14). If there's a fountain east of that, that could work. 

But the agent tried pushing east before and it didn't work. Maybe because there's another obstacle. 

Another consideration: the agent's inventory has a +1 long sword, lance, ring mail, etc., but no keys or tools that would help remove obstacles. The bars are permanent barriers. 

So the best bet is to push the boulder towards the fountain in the west or south direction. Since the fountain is adjacent to south and west, pushing the boulder west into the west fountain seems viable. 

Thus, the agent should move west to (39,15), then south to (39,14), and push west. 

But in the current observation, the agent is at (40,15), and the boulder is adjacent southwest. So moving west to (39,15) is possible, then moving south to (39,14) where the boulder is, and then pushing west. 

The action would be ""push west"" once the agent is adjacent. 

So the appropriate action now is to move west to get next to the boulder, then push west. 

Since the agent is already at (40,15), moving west to (39,15) is the next step. 

But the user's previous attempts to move west didn't result in any change in the message, indicating that movement is possible. 

So the correct sequence is: west, south, push west. 

But the user needs to output the next action. Given the current state, the agent needs to move west to (39,15) to get adjacent to the boulder. 

Therefore, the next action should be ""west"".

The goal is to push the boulder onto the fountain. Let me look at the current observation.

The cursor is at (39,15). The map shows a boulder at (40,15) because when I moved west earlier, I ended up at (39,15). The boulder was previously adjacent to the northeast and west, but after moving west, the boulder might have moved. Wait, the language observation says ""boulder adjacent southwest"" now. Hmm, maybe the boulder is to the southwest of the agent's current position.

Looking at the map, the agent's position is marked with @. The boulder might be adjacent. The message when trying to push before said ""in vain,"" which probably means there's an obstacle behind the boulder. The bars are still blocking north, so the boulder can't go north. 

The fountain is adjacent southeast. So the plan is to get the boulder to the southeast fountain. To do that, the agent needs to position the boulder so that it can be pushed towards the southeast. Since the boulder is currently southwest of the agent, maybe the agent needs to move in a direction that allows pushing the boulder south or east.

Wait, the boulder is adjacent southwest. That means the boulder is to the southwest of the agent's current position. So if the agent is at (39,15), the boulder would be at (38,14) or nearby. To push the boulder, the agent needs to move towards it and then push. But the agent is currently at (39,15). If the boulder is southwest, maybe it's at (38,14). To push it east or south, the agent needs to be adjacent.

But the agent just moved west to (39,15). Let me check the language observation again. It says ""boulder adjacent southwest."" So the boulder is southwest of the agent. That would be to the left and down. So the boulder's position is (38,14). 

The agent needs to get next to the boulder to push it. To do that, the agent should move west again to (38,15), which would be south of the boulder? Wait, no. If the boulder is southwest at (38,14), then moving west from (39,15) to (38,15) would place the agent to the north of the boulder. Then the agent could push it south. 

Alternatively, moving south to (39,16) would place the agent east of the boulder, allowing a push west. But looking at the map, there's a fountain at the southeast. So pushing the boulder towards the southeast fountain would require moving it south or east. 

If the agent moves west to (38,15), then pushes the boulder south to (38,14), but that's where the boulder was already. Maybe the boulder needs to be moved further. Alternatively, the agent could move south to (39,16) and then push the boulder west into a position where it can then be pushed east towards the fountain. 

Wait, the agent's current position is (39,15). The boulder is at (38,14) (southwest). So the agent can move west to (38,15), which is north of the boulder. Then push south into (38,14), but that's where the boulder is. Wait, maybe the agent needs to position themselves to the west of the boulder to push it east. 

If the agent moves west to (38,15), they are north of the boulder at (38,14). To push the boulder south, they would move south into (38,15) and then push the boulder south to (38,14), but that's the same spot. That doesn't help. 

Alternatively, moving south to (39,16) and then west to (38,16), which is east of the boulder at (38,14). Then pushing the boulder north into (38,15), but that's the agent's position. Not helpful. 

Hmm. Maybe the agent needs to move in a different direction. Looking at the language observation, there's a fountain adjacent southeast. So the agent should try to get the boulder towards there. The boulder is currently southwest. So maybe push it east first. 

If the agent moves west to (38,15), then pushes the boulder east into (39,15), which is where the agent is. That's not possible. Wait, the agent is already at (39,15). The boulder is at (38,14). To push the boulder east, the agent needs to be to the west of the boulder. So the agent should move to (38,15), which is north of the boulder. Then, to push the boulder east, the agent needs to move into the boulder's position. So the agent moves west to (38,15), then pushes east into (39,15), which is occupied by the agent. That can't be right. 

Wait, when you push a boulder, you move into it, and it moves in the opposite direction. So if the agent is at (38,15) and the boulder is at (38,14), the agent can move south into the boulder, pushing it north to (38,15). But that doesn't help. 

Alternatively, if the agent is at (38,15) (north of the boulder at (38,14)), they can push the boulder south by moving south into (38,14), but that's where the boulder is. That's not possible. 

Maybe the agent needs to move east to (40,15), which is where they were before. Then, the boulder is at (38,14). The agent could move south to (40,16) and then push the boulder west. But that might not be the right path. 

Alternatively, check if there's a way to get the boulder closer to the fountain. The fountain is southeast. So pushing the boulder east or south-east. But bars are blocking north, so south might be an option. 

Looking at the map, there's a stairs up near westsouthwest, but that's probably not relevant right now. The key is to get the boulder to the fountain. 

Another approach: The agent is at (39,15). The boulder is southwest at (38,14). The agent needs to move to the west of the boulder to push it east. So move west to (38,15), then push east into (39,15), but that's where the agent is. That's a problem. 

Wait, maybe the agent can move south to (39,16), then west to (38,16), which is east of the boulder at (38,14). Then push the boulder north into (38,15). But that's the agent's previous position. 

This is getting confusing. Let me think again. The boulder is at (38,14). The fountain is at southeast, which would be (41,16) perhaps. To get the boulder there, need to move it east and south. 

The agent is at (39,15). To push the boulder east, the agent must be to the west of the boulder. So move west to (38,15), then push east into (39,15), but the agent is already there. So that's not possible. 

Alternatively, the agent can move south to (39,16), then west to (38,16), which is east of the boulder. Then push the boulder north into (38,15), which is where the agent was. Still stuck. 

Maybe the agent needs to find a way to bypass the bars. The bars are blocking north, so pushing the boulder north isn't possible. South might be an option. If the agent can push the boulder south towards the fountain. 

From (38,14), pushing south would take it to (38,13). Is that allowed? The language observation doesn't mention obstacles there, just bars in certain directions. If there are no bars south of the boulder, then pushing it south could work. 

But the agent needs to be adjacent to the boulder. So the agent needs to get to the south of the boulder. To do that, the agent could move west to (38,15), then south to (38,16), then east to (39,16), and then south to (39,17), positioning to push the boulder. But this seems complicated. 

Alternatively, maybe the boulder can be pushed into a position where it's adjacent to the fountain. The fountain is adjacent southeast. So if the boulder is pushed to (40,16), then the agent can push it further east. 

But the agent is at (39,15). To get to (40,16), the agent would need to move east and south. However, moving east from (39,15) to (40,15) is possible if the boulder isn't blocking. The boulder is at (38,14), so that path is clear. 

Wait, the agent is at (39,15). The boulder is at (38,14). If the agent moves east to (40,15), then they can move south to (40,16), which is east of the current position. Then, from there, push the boulder east into (41,16), which is near the fountain. 

But how to get the boulder from (38,14) to (41,16)? That would require multiple pushes. First, push it east to (39,14), then (40,14), then (41,14), then south to (41,15), then east to (41,16). But this seems like a long process and might require navigating around obstacles. 

The current observation shows that the agent tried to push west before but it didn't work because of an obstacle. Maybe there's a wall or bar behind the boulder. The message said ""in vain,"" which implies there's something blocking the boulder's path. 

Looking at the map, the bars are very near north, northeast, etc., so maybe pushing the boulder south into an area without bars. If the agent can push the boulder south past the bars, that might work. 

So, steps could be: 
1. Agent moves west to (38,15) to be north of the boulder.
2. Push the boulder south to (38,14) → but that's the same spot. 
Wait, no. If the agent is at (38,15) and the boulder is at (38,14), pushing the boulder south would require the agent to move into the boulder's position. So the agent moves south to (38,14), pushing the boulder north to (38,15). But that doesn't help. 

This is tricky. Maybe the agent needs to find a different approach. Let's check the inventory. The agent has a blessed lance and a long sword. Maybe using a projectile to move the boulder, but I think in Boxoban, you can only push, not shoot. 

Alternatively, maybe the boulder is stuck because there's a bar behind it. The message when pushing said ""in vain,"" so there's an obstacle. Looking at the language observation, the bars are very near north, so if the boulder is pushed north, it hits the bars. But pushing south or east might be possible. 

If the agent can push the boulder east into an open area, then from there push it towards the fountain. 

So, from the current position (39,15), the agent needs to move to the west of the boulder (38,14). To do that, move west to (38,15), then push east into (39,15), but the agent is there. Not possible. 

Wait, maybe the agent should move south to (39,16), then west to (38,16), then push the boulder north into (38,15). But that's the agent's previous position. 

Hmm. Perhaps the agent needs to move east to (40,15), then move south to (40,16), then west to (39,16), and then push the boulder east. But I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, check if the boulder is at (38,14) and the fountain is at (41,16). The agent needs to move the boulder along the south or east directions. 

Another idea: The agent can move south to (39,16), then east to (40,16), then push the boulder south into (40,15), then east to (41,15), and finally push it north into (41,16), which is the fountain. But this requires the boulder to pass through those areas without obstacles. 

Looking at the language observation, bars are present in various directions, but maybe there's a path. The agent needs to navigate carefully. 

Given the confusion, maybe the best immediate action is to try pushing the boulder in a direction that could move it towards the fountain. Since the boulder is southwest, pushing it east might be a start. 

So, the agent is at (39,15). To push the boulder east, the agent needs to be west of it. Move west to (38,15), then push east. But when the agent tries to push east, the boulder would move to (39,15), which is where the agent is. That's not possible. 

Wait, when you push a boulder, you move into it, and it moves in the opposite direction. So if the agent is at (38,15) and pushes east, the boulder moves west to (38,14). But that's where it was. 

This is a dead end. Maybe the agent needs to find a way to get around the boulder. For example, move south to (39,16), then west to (38,16), then push the boulder north into (38,15). But that's the agent's original position. 

Alternatively, move south to (39,16), then east to (40,16), then push the boulder south into (40,15). Then from there, push it east to (41,15), and finally north into (41,16). 

This seems possible, but requires multiple steps. However, the agent needs to choose a single action now. 

Given the current position and the need to progress, perhaps the best immediate action is to move east to (40,15), which is clear, then from there attempt to push the boulder. 

Alternatively, try pushing the boulder west, but that's towards the bars. 

Wait, the message when trying to push west before said ""in vain,"" which implies there's a bar behind. So pushing west is not possible. 

Given all this, the best action might be to move east to (40,15) and then try pushing the boulder south or east. 

So, the agent's next move should be east to (40,15), then from there push the boulder. But since the agent can only choose one action now, they should move east to get into a position to push the boulder east towards the fountain.

47,push west,"<reasoning>
I need to figure out how to push the boulder onto the fountain in this Boxoban-like game. Let's start by looking at the current situation.

The agent is a knight at position (40,15). The map shows some bars, dark areas, and what looks like a boulder near westnorthwest and the agent's current position. There's a fountain very near eastsoutheast, which is the goal. 

The previous actions tried moving around, pushing the boulder east, but it didn't work. The message says ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain,"" which probably means there's something blocking the boulder's path. Maybe another object or the wall.

Looking at the cursor position and the map, the agent is next to a boulder. The observations mention a boulder adjacent east and southwest. So, the boulder is probably to the east or southwest of the agent. 

The goal is to push the boulder onto the fountain. The fountain is south and west adjacent. So, the boulder needs to be moved southwest towards the fountain. 

Wait, the current cursor is at (40,15). The fountain is adjacent south and west. So, if the agent can move the boulder west or south, it might reach the fountain. But the previous attempts to push east didn't work because of a block. 

The obstacle might be bars or another boulder. The language observation mentions bars adjacent north and northwest. So, moving north or northwest is blocked by bars. 

Looking at the map symbols: '@' is the agent, '{' might be the boulder, and '<' could be the fountain. The map shows ""#....{@.`#"", which suggests the agent is next to some objects. 

The agent should try to push the boulder southwest. Since the agent is at (40,15), pushing the boulder southwest would mean moving west and then south. But the agent's last position was (40,15) after moving west. 

Wait, the last valid action was 'west' which moved the agent to (39,15). Then tried pushing west again but it didn't work. Maybe the boulder is to the west of the agent now. 

If the boulder is adjacent southwest, the agent needs to push it southwest. That would require moving the boulder by walking into it from the northwest direction. 

But the agent is at (39,15) after moving west. The boulder is near westnorthwest and westsouthwest. So, perhaps the boulder is diagonally southwest from the agent. 

In Boxoban, to push a boulder, the agent has to move into it, and there must be empty space behind the boulder. So, if the agent is at (39,15) and the boulder is at (38,16), the agent could move south into the boulder, pushing it to (38,15). But need to check if that space is free. 

Alternatively, if the boulder is at (39,16), the agent could move west into it, pushing to (38,16). 

Looking at the map: the line with the agent is ""#....{@.`#"". The agent is in the 5th position (assuming each '.' is a space). So, maybe the boulder is to the east or west. 

This is a bit confusing without the exact map layout. But based on the observations, the boulder is adjacent east and southwest. The agent is at (40,15). So, the boulder could be at (41,15) (east) or (40,16) (south) or (39,15) (west) or (40,14) (north). But earlier attempts to push east didn't work, so maybe the boulder is east but blocked. 

Alternatively, the boulder is southwest of the agent. If the agent moves south, then west, they could push it towards the fountain. 

The fountain is adjacent south and west. So, if the boulder can be moved to (39,14) or (40,14), that might place it on the fountain. 

But the bars adjacent north and northwest are blocking movement in those directions. So, the agent needs to move south or east. 

Wait, the latest cursor position is (40,15) after moving west. The boulder is adjacent east and southwest. So, the boulder is either at (41,15) (east) or (40,16) (south) or (39,15) (west) or (40,14) (north). But since the agent is at (40,15), the adjacent positions would be:

- north: (40,14)
- east: (41,15)
- south: (40,16)
- west: (39,15)

The boulder is adjacent east and southwest. Southwest would be (39,16). But that's not adjacent to the agent's position. So perhaps the boulder is at (41,15) (east) and (39,15) (west). But earlier attempts to push east failed, meaning there's an obstacle there. 

Looking at the language observation, there are bars very near north, northnortheast, etc. So, moving north is blocked by bars. The bars adjacent north and northwest mean the agent can't move north or northwest. 

So, possible moves: south, east, west, or push in those directions. 

The agent is at (40,15). If the boulder is to the east (41,15), and pushing it east is blocked (maybe by bars or another boulder), the agent needs to try pushing it in another direction. 

But the fountain is south and west. So, maybe pushing the boulder west or south-west. 

If the boulder is at (40,16) (south), the agent could move south into it, pushing to (40,15), but that would swap positions. Not helpful. 

Alternatively, if the boulder is at (39,15) (west), the agent could move west into it, pushing to (38,15), but need to check if that space is free. 

The latest map shows ""#....{@.`#"", which might indicate that moving west from (40,15) to (39,15) is possible, but the boulder is there. 

Wait, the cursor is at (40,15), and the map line is ""#....{@.`#"". Let's parse this. Each '#' is a wall or obstacle. The '.' are floor tiles. The '@' is the agent. The '{' is the boulder. So, the line is:

# . . . . {@ . ` #

So, positions (assuming x increases to the right, y increases downward):

x=35: #
x=36: .
x=37: .
x=38: .
x=39: .
x=40: {
x=41: @
x=42: .
x=43: `
x=44: #

So, the agent is at (41,15) (since x=41 is the @). Wait, previous steps: initial position was (40,15). After moving west, it became (39,15). Then tried east back to (40,15). Then north to (40,14), then south back. 

Wait, maybe the map's x and y are inverted. The cursor position is (x=40, y=15), and the map line is ""#....{@.`#"". If each character represents a tile in the map, then the agent is at position 41 in the string (since counting from 0 or 1?), which would correspond to x=41, y=15. But earlier movements might have adjusted that. 

This is getting confusing. Let's try to simplify. The agent needs to push the boulder towards the fountain, which is south and west. The boulder is currently nearby. 

Possible actions:

1. Try pushing the boulder west again. If the previous attempt failed, maybe there's a different way.
2. Move south to get a better position.
3. Check if the boulder can be pushed southwest by moving diagonally.

In Boxoban, you can push a boulder by moving into it, and the space behind must be free. So, if the agent is next to the boulder and the space behind is clear, they can push it. 

Given the obstacles (bars), the agent must find a path where pushing the boulder doesn't hit a wall. 

Looking at the latest observations, the boulder is adjacent east and southwest. The agent is at (40,15). If the boulder is at (41,15) (east), then pushing east would require the space at (42,15) to be free. But the language observation says there are bars very near north, etc., which might block east. 

Alternatively, if the boulder is at (40,16) (south), pushing south would require (40,17) to be free. 

But the fountain is adjacent south and west, so ideally, the boulder needs to be placed on (40,14) or (39,15). 

Given the agent's current position and the boulder's location, the best bet is to try pushing the boulder west or southwest. 

Since the agent is at (40,15), moving west to (39,15) and then pushing the boulder southwest (to (38,16)) could work, provided that (38,16) is a floor and not blocked. 

But the bars adjacent north and northwest might be in the way. 

Alternatively, the agent can move south to (40,16) and then try pushing the boulder west or southwest from there. 

Given the uncertainty, the safest action might be to push the boulder west, which was the last direction tried but failed. Maybe there was a momentary block, but now it's possible. 

Alternatively, check the adjacent squares. If the boulder is to the east and the space behind is clear, push it. But since pushing east didn't work before, perhaps the space behind is blocked by bars. 

In the end, the most logical action is to continue trying to push the boulder in a direction that leads it towards the fountain, probably west or southwest. 

Given the agent's current position and the fountain's location, pushing the boulder southwest (which would be moving the agent west and then south) might be the way to go. 

So, the chosen action is to push the boulder west. But since the previous attempt failed, maybe the correct action is to move west first and then push. 

Wait, the agent is at (40,15). If the boulder is at (39,15) (west), then the agent can move west into it, pushing to (38,15). But need to check if (38,15) is free. 

The language observation mentions bars very near north, etc., but not specifically at (38,15). Assuming that's a floor, pushing the boulder there would get it closer to the fountain at (39,14) or (40,14). 

Alternatively, if the boulder is at (40,16) (south), the agent can move south into it, pushing to (40,15), which doesn't help. 

Given the information, the best bet is to try pushing the boulder west again, possibly after moving into the correct position. 

But the previous attempt to push west resulted in a message saying it couldn't move, so maybe there's an obstacle now. 

Alternatively, the agent should move south to get a clear path. 

After considering all options, the most plausible action is to push the boulder west, even if it failed before, in case the environment changed. Alternatively, move west and then push. 

But the user's tip says to avoid repeating the same action if nothing changes. However, since the agent just moved back and forth, maybe a different direction is needed. 

Given the fountain is south and west, perhaps pushing the boulder southwest by moving the agent west and then south, then pushing. 

But the agent's current position is (40,15). Moving west to (39,15), then south to (39,16), and then push the boulder west to (38,16). 

But this requires multiple steps. Since the agent needs to output a single action, the immediate action should be to either move towards the boulder or push it. 

Considering all this, the best action is to try pushing the boulder west again, as it's the most direct path towards the fountain.

48,push west,"<reasoning>
Let me try to figure out what I should do here. The agent is in a Boxoban-like game, trying to push boulders onto fountains. The goal is to get all the boulders to their target positions.

Looking at the current observation, the agent is at position (40, 15). The map has several bars and dark areas, which I assume are obstacles. The nearest boulder is adjacent to the southwest, and there's a fountain adjacent to the southeast and west. So, a boulder is nearby that needs to be pushed towards the fountain.

The previous actions tried moving south multiple times, but the message says ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" That probably means there's something blocking the path when trying to push the boulder south. Maybe another obstacle or another boulder?

The inventory shows the agent has a long sword and a lance, but those aren't useful for pushing boulders. The important thing here is to navigate around obstacles and push the boulder towards the fountain.

Looking at the map, the fountain is to the southeast and west of the agent. The boulder adjacent to the southwest might be the one that needs moving. To push it southwest towards the fountain, the agent would need to move in a direction that allows pushing the boulder. But the agent is at (40,15), and the boulder is southwest, which would be to the left (west) and down (south). 

Wait, the boulder adjacent southwest means it's one step southwest of the agent's current position. So the agent is at (40,15), and the boulder is at (39,14) or (39,16)? Let me check the map. The map shows the agent's position with '@' at (39,15) after moving west. Wait, in the latest observation, the cursor is at (40,15) with the map showing #....{@.`# on line 8. So '@' is at (40,15). The boulder adjacent southwest would be at (39,14) or (39,16). 

If the boulder is southwest of the agent, pushing it southwest would take it further towards the fountain. But the agent needs to position themselves to push it. Since the agent is at (40,15), to push a boulder southwest, they would need to move west and then push. But earlier attempts to move south resulted in failure, possibly because there's a bar or another obstacle.

Looking at the language observation, there are bars very near the north, northeast, etc. The bars adjacent to the agent are north and northwest. The message when trying to move south before was ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain,"" which might mean there's something blocking the path when pushing the boulder south. Maybe another boulder or an obstacle.

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to move around the bars to get a clear path. The bars adjacent north and northwest mean that moving north or northwest is blocked. So the agent can't go that way. The other directions are south, east, or west. 

Since the agent is trying to push the boulder towards the fountain (adjacent southeast and west), perhaps moving east towards the fountain would be better. But when the agent tried moving east before, it either didn't work or the boulder wasn't there. 

Wait, the fountain is adjacent southeast and west. The agent is at (40,15). So to the west is the fountain, and to the southeast is another fountain. The boulder adjacent southwest needs to be pushed towards the west fountain. 

If the agent moves west, they could get next to the boulder and push it west. But the agent's current position is (40,15). Moving west to (39,15) would put them next to the boulder (which is southwest of (40,15), so maybe at (39,14) or (39,16)). Wait, if the boulder is adjacent southwest, that would be diagonally south and west. So from (40,15), southwest would be (39,14). So the boulder is at (39,14). 

To push that boulder southwest (to (38,13)), the agent would need to be adjacent to it and push in that direction. But the agent is at (40,15). To get to (39,14), the agent needs to move west once to (39,15), then south to (39,14). But moving south from (39,15) would require checking if there's a path. However, the bars very near north, northeast, etc., might block that. 

Alternatively, the agent could move west to (39,15), then try to push the boulder south to (39,14) towards the fountain. But the problem is that when the agent tried moving south before, it didn't work. Maybe there's a bar in the way. 

Looking at the map, the line 8 shows ""#....{@.`#"". The '@' is at position (40,15) in that line. The characters around it are dots and possibly bars. The presence of bars in the adjacent areas might prevent the agent from pushing the boulder in certain directions. 

Another approach: since the boulder is adjacent southwest, maybe the agent should move west and then push the boulder south. But the agent needs to check if the space behind the boulder is free. If the agent moves west to (39,15), then tries to push the boulder south into (39,14), but if there's a bar or another obstacle there, it won't work. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent should move north around the bars, but the bars are adjacent north and northwest, so moving north is blocked. 

The other option is to move east towards the fountain, but the boulder is not there. The fountain is to the southeast and west, so pushing the boulder west into the fountain adjacent to (39,14) would require getting the boulder to (38,14) or similar. 

Given the previous failures when trying to move south, perhaps the agent needs to position itself differently. Maybe move west to get next to the boulder and then push it south. 

So the steps could be: west to (39,15), then push south. But before that, check if moving west is possible. The language observation says there are bars very near north, northeast, etc., but moving west from (40,15) to (39,15) should be possible unless there's a bar there. The map shows dots and possibly a bar in that area. Looking at the map line 8: ""#....{@.`#"". The '@' is at the fifth position (assuming each # is a position). So the characters are: # . . . @ . ` #. So moving west from (40,15) to (39,15) is a dot, which is passable. 

So the agent can move west to (39,15), then attempt to push the boulder south into (39,14). If that space is free, the boulder can be pushed. The message when trying to push before was ""in vain,"" which might mean the space behind the boulder is blocked. 

Looking at the latest observation, the boulder adjacent southwest. If the agent moves to (39,15), then tries to push the boulder south (to (39,14)), they need to check if (39,14) is free. The language observation mentions bars very near north, etc., but doesn't specify the south direction. If there's a bar at (39,14), then pushing the boulder there would fail. 

Alternatively, maybe the space behind the boulder is clear. If the agent can push the boulder south into (39,14), which is adjacent to the west fountain, that would solve the puzzle. 

So the plan is: move west to (39,15), then push the boulder south to (39,14). 

But the user's previous attempt to push west resulted in a default action of north due to invalid input. So the correct action format is to specify ""push west"" as the action. 

Therefore, the chosen action is to push the boulder west, which would move it towards the fountain.

49,south,"<reasoning>
The agent is trying to solve Boxoban. The goal is to push all boulders onto fountains. The map has bars (walls), dark areas, stairs, boulders, and fountains. The current position is (40,15). There are two boulders: one near westnorthwest and another very near east. The fountains are southeast and southwest, and there's a fountain adjacent southeast and southwest.

In previous steps, the agent tried moving south multiple times but couldn't push the boulder. Then tried east, north, and west. The last action was ""push west"", which was invalid. The error message says ""You cannot pass through the bars,"" so maybe the boulder is blocked by a bar or another obstacle.

Looking at the map, the agent is at (40,15). The boulder adjacent southwest means there's a boulder to the southwest of the agent. To push it west, the agent would need to move west into the boulder, but it's blocked by bars. The bars are very near north, northeast, etc., so the path west might be blocked.

Alternative approach: Maybe the agent needs to move around the boulder. The other boulder is near westnorthwest, which is further west. If the agent moves north or south around the current boulder, perhaps they can position themselves to push it. Let's check the surroundings.

The fountain is adjacent southeast and southwest. The agent's current position is (40,15). The southeast fountain is near eastsoutheast. If the agent can push the eastern boulder towards there, that would solve the level. The eastern boulder is very near east. So maybe the agent needs to go east and push that one towards the fountain.

But moving east from (40,15) to (41,15) had a boulder there that couldn't be moved before. Wait, in the last observation, the boulder adjacent east. So at (41,15) there's a boulder. The agent tried pushing west, but that's blocked by bars. Maybe the agent should try to move north or south around the eastern boulder and then push it east towards the fountain.

Alternatively, check if there's a path to the western boulder. The western boulder is near westnorthwest, which is at (38,13) maybe? Since the agent is at (40,15), moving west would go towards (39,15), but there's a boulder at (39,15) (from the map's #<..``{.{# where the boulder is represented by '@' or something similar). Wait, the map shows the agent at (40,15) with '@' in the position. The boulders are near westnorthwest and east. The eastern boulder is adjacent east, so at (42,15).

So to push the eastern boulder (at 42,15) towards the southeast fountain, the agent needs to move east into it, but that's blocked by bars. The bars are very near north, so maybe the path is blocked. The agent might need to move north or south around the boulder and then push it.

Alternatively, check if the western boulder can be moved. The western boulder is near westnorthwest, so perhaps at (38,14). The agent is at (40,15). To push that boulder west, they would need to move west into it, but there's a bar adjacent northwest. So maybe that's blocked.

Another idea: The stairs up are near westsouthwest. Maybe the solution is to push both boulders and then use the stairs, but the goal is to push onto fountains. The agent needs to focus on moving the boulders to the fountains.

Looking at the fountain positions: southeast and southwest. The eastern boulder is near east, so pushing it southeast towards the fountain there. But the path might be blocked by bars. The agent needs to navigate around the bars to position themselves to push the boulder.

Current position: (40,15). The eastern boulder is at (42,15). To push it east towards the fountain at eastsoutheast, the agent would need to move east into the boulder, but there's a bar adjacent north and northwest. Perhaps the agent should move north or south around the boulder first.

If the agent moves north to (40,14), then tries to push the boulder east, but the boulder is at (42,15). From (40,14), moving east to (41,14), then maybe push the boulder from there. But the map shows bars very near north, so maybe that's not possible.

Alternatively, the agent could move south to (40,16) and try to push the eastern boulder south-east. But the map doesn't show a clear path there. The bars are very near south, southsoutheast, etc., so that might be blocked.

This is tricky. Maybe the agent needs to try a different direction. Let's look at the last valid action that worked. Previously, moving east from (39,15) to (40,15) placed the agent next to a boulder. Then pushing west wasn't possible due to bars. Perhaps the agent should try moving north or south around the current position and then attempt to push the boulder again.

Looking at the language observation, the bars adjacent north and northwest. So from (40,15), moving north would hit a bar. Moving northwest would also be blocked. So the agent can't go north or northwest. What about south? The agent was trying south before but it didn't work. The boulder adjacent south and southwest. So at (40,15), south is (40,16), which has a boulder. To push that boulder south, the agent would need to move into it, but there's a bar very near south, so maybe that's blocked.

Alternatively, the agent could move west to (39,15), which has a boulder there. Then try to push that one west, but it's blocked by bars. Alternatively, move north to (39,14) and try to push the western boulder. But the bars are adjacent north and northwest, so that's not possible.

Hmm. Maybe the agent should try to move around the eastern boulder. From (40,15), move east to (41,15), which is blocked by a boulder. Then move north to (41,14) and try to push the boulder east from there. But the bars are very near north, so that might not work.

Alternatively, the agent could look for a path to the western boulder. From (40,15), move west to (39,15), which has a boulder. Then try to push it west, but it's blocked by bars. So that's not helpful.

Wait, the inventory shows the agent has a +1 long sword and a lance, but in Boxoban, you don't need weapons to push boulders. The key is to move the boulders with your body. The problem seems to be that the boulders are blocked by bars, and the agent is not able to find a path to maneuver them.

Perhaps the solution is to find a way to move the boulder by going around it. For example, if the agent can move north around the eastern boulder and then push it east towards the fountain. Let's see: from (40,15), move north to (40,14). Then move east to (41,14). From there, push the eastern boulder (at 42,15) east into (43,15), but the fountain is at eastsoutheast, which might be (43,16) or similar. However, the map's fountain positions are not clearly indicated in the coordinates, but the language observation says fountain very near eastsoutheast, which is probably in that general area.

But the bars are very near north, so moving north from (40,15) to (40,14) might be possible if there's no bar there. The language observation says bars very near north, so maybe (40,14) is blocked by a bar. Hence, the agent can't move north.

This is getting complicated. Maybe the agent needs to try a different approach. Since the previous attempts to push west or east didn't work, perhaps the best move is to try moving south again, even though it didn't work before. Or check if there's a way to move the boulder by first moving in another direction.

Wait, the agent's previous action was ""push west"", which was invalid. The system defaulted to north, which hit a bar. Now, the agent needs to choose a valid action. Looking at the current position and surrounding bars, the possible valid moves are east, south, or west, but those might be blocked.

Alternatively, the agent could try moving to a different direction entirely. For example, moving northeast or northwest, but the language observation says bars are adjacent north and northwest, so those directions are blocked.

In this case, the only possible valid move might be to move south again, even though it didn't work before. Or maybe the agent is stuck and needs to find another way. Alternatively, check if there's a way to push the boulder by moving in a different sequence.

Another idea: The agent could move east to (41,15), which has a boulder. Then move north to (41,14) and try to push the boulder east from there. But again, bars might block the path.

Given the constraints, the best possible action the agent can take without further observation is to try moving south again, hoping that maybe the blockage has changed, or to explore another direction that might lead to a valid push.

Let's see where I am in this Boxoban level. I need to push all the boulders onto the fountains. The map looks pretty cluttered with bars, so navigating around them is going to be tricky.

Looking at the current position, I'm at (40,16). The boulder is adjacent to the west, so maybe I need to push it towards a fountain. The language observation mentions a fountain adjacent northwest. If I can push the boulder west into that direction, it might end up on the fountain.

But wait, the boulder is already adjacent to me (west), but when I tried pushing it west before, there were bars blocking the way. The latest observation says ""boulder adjacent southwest"". So perhaps the boulder is southwest of me? Or maybe I need to check the map again.

Looking at the map, my position is marked with '@' at (39,15) previously, but now I'm at (40,16). The boulder is near westnorthwest, but in the current observation, the boulder is very near eastnortheast and west. Wait, this is a bit confusing. Let me parse the latest observations.

The current language observation says ""boulder very near eastnortheast and west"". So there's a boulder to the eastnortheast and another to the west. My current position is (40,16). If there's a boulder west of me, that would be at (39,16). The fountain is adjacent northwest, which would be at (39,15). So maybe I need to move west to get next to the boulder and then push it northwest towards the fountain.

But when I tried moving west before, there were bars. The latest observation says ""bars adjacent southeast, south, and southwest"". So moving southwest might be blocked. But if the boulder is to the west, perhaps I can move west, then push it northwest.

Alternatively, maybe the boulder is to the northwest. The map shows a '#' symbol which might be the boulder. Let me check the map again. The map has a '#' at position (39,14) perhaps? Not sure. The cursor is at (40,16), and the map shows ""#<..``@.{#"". So in the 9th line (assuming y=15 is the 9th line), there's a '@' at position 8 (since x=40, which might correspond to the 8th or 9th character in the line). The boulder is represented by '#' characters. 

In the current map, the line is ""#<..``@.{#"". So the '@' is between some characters. The boulder might be to the west of the '@', which is at (40,15) maybe? Wait, the cursor position is (40,15) in some previous steps, but now it's (40,16). The map's y-coordinate might be different. This is getting a bit confusing with the coordinates, but the key is to figure out where the boulder is and where the fountain is.

The fountain is adjacent northwest, which would be up and to the left. If I can push the boulder in that direction, it should land on the fountain. Since the boulder is near west, moving west to get next to it, then pushing northwest. But I need to check if there's a clear path.

The bars are adjacent southeast, south, and southwest, so moving in those directions is blocked. So probably, the best move is to go west to the boulder, then push it northwest towards the fountain. Let me try moving west first.

Let me try to figure out what to do next. The goal is to push the boulder onto the fountain. Looking at the current observation, the boulder is adjacent to the southwest. The fountain is adjacent to the northwest. The agent is at (40,16). The boulder is west of the agent.

Wait, in the last move, the agent tried to push west but failed. The message said ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" That probably means there's something blocking the path behind the boulder. Let me check the map again. The map shows the boulder at westnorthwest, which might be near the agent's current position. Maybe there's a wall or another obstacle behind the boulder that's preventing it from being pushed further west.

The agent is at (40,16). The boulder is adjacent southwest. So the boulder is at (39,16). To push it west, the agent would need to move into the boulder's position, then the boulder would move west. But the previous attempt failed, so maybe there's something blocking the way west of the boulder. Let me check the language observations. The bars adjacent to the boulder are northwest, which might mean there's a wall or obstacle there. 

If the boulder is stuck because there's a wall behind it, the agent can't push it further. So maybe the agent needs to move around to a different position to approach the boulder from another angle. Alternatively, maybe the boulder needs to be pushed south or north first to free it up. 

Looking at the map, the agent is at (40,16). The fountain is adjacent northwest, which would be at (39,15). The boulder is at (39,16). If the agent can move north and then try to push the boulder west, that might work. Let me think: if the agent moves north to (40,15), then tries to push west into the boulder, the boulder might move to (39,15), which is the fountain's location. That could solve the problem. 

But first, the agent needs to reposition. Let's see the available actions. The agent could move north, then attempt to push west. Let me check the current cursor position. The agent is at (40,16). Moving north to (40,15). Then, from there, pushing west into the boulder at (39,16) would move it to (39,15), which is the fountain. That seems possible. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent should move south first to get a different angle. But the agent was previously at (40,15) and moved south to (40,16). Maybe moving north again is better. 

Another possibility is that the boulder is blocked by a bar or wall. The language observation mentions bars adjacent to the boulder's northwest. So if the boulder is at (39,16), pushing it west would require moving it to (38,16), but there's a bar there, preventing movement. That would explain why pushing west failed. So the agent needs to find a way to move the boulder around the bars. 

Perhaps the agent can push the boulder north or south instead. Let's see. If the agent moves north to (40,15), then tries to push north into the boulder, but the boulder's position is (39,16). Wait, moving the agent north to (40,15) would allow them to be adjacent to the boulder at (39,16). Then pushing west would target (39,15). But if there's a bar at (38,16), that's still a problem. Unless pushing the boulder north or south first. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent should move west to (39,16) and then push west, but that's where the boulder is. Wait, the agent is at (40,16). To push the boulder west, the agent needs to be next to it. The boulder is at (39,16), so the agent is east of it. So the agent can move west to (39,16) and then push further west. But the previous attempt to push west from (40,16) didn't work, probably because the boulder is blocked. 

Wait, the message said ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" So when the agent tried to push west from (40,16), the boulder is at (39,16), and pushing it west would require moving it to (38,16), but there's a bar there. So the boulder can't be pushed further west. Therefore, the agent needs to push the boulder in another direction if possible. 

Looking at the boulder's current position (39,16), adjacent cells are north (39,15), south (39,17), east (40,16) where the agent is, and west (38,16) which is blocked. So the only possible directions to push the boulder are north or south. 

If the agent can push the boulder north to (39,15), which is the fountain's location, that would solve the problem. But is there a way to do that? The agent is at (40,16). To push the boulder north, the agent needs to be north of it. So the agent would need to move north to (40,15), then push north into the boulder. Let's check if that's possible. 

From (40,15), pushing north into the boulder at (39,16) would attempt to move it to (39,15), which is the fountain. If there's no obstacle there, that would work. But the language observation mentions the fountain is adjacent to northwest, which is (39,15) from the agent's current position (40,16). Wait, the fountain adjacent northwest from the agent's position would be (39,15). So yes, pushing the boulder there would place it on the fountain. 

But how to get the agent to the position where they can push the boulder north. The agent is at (40,16). Moving north to (40,15), then moving west to (39,15) and pushing north? Or maybe directly push north from (40,15). 

Wait, the agent is at (40,16). To push the boulder north, the agent needs to be north of the boulder. The boulder is at (39,16). So the agent needs to be at (40,15) to be north of the boulder. Then, pushing north would move the boulder to (39,15), the fountain. 

So the plan is: move north to (40,15), then push north into the boulder. Let's check if that's possible. 

In the current state, the agent is at (40,16). Moving north to (40,15). Then, from there, the boulder is at (39,16). The agent can push north into the boulder, which would attempt to move it to (39,15). The fountain is at (39,15), so that's the target. 

But we need to ensure that there's no obstacle at (39,15). The language observation says the fountain is adjacent northwest from the agent's current position (40,16), which is (39,15). So that cell should be a fountain. Therefore, pushing the boulder there should succeed. 

So the steps would be: move north to (40,15), then push north. 

Alternatively, the agent could move west to (39,16) and then push north, but that's the same as moving north first. 

Another consideration: the agent's previous attempts to push west failed because the boulder is blocked by a bar to the west. So pushing north or south might be the way to go. 

Therefore, the best action now is to move north to (40,15), then push north to move the boulder onto the fountain.

52,Failed to obtain a valid action from the reasoning.,"<reasoning>
The agent is in a Boxoban-like game. The goal is to push boulders onto fountains. Let's look at the current state.

The cursor is at (40, 15). The map shows several bars and a boulder near westnorthwest. There's a fountain very near eastsoutheast. The previous actions tried pushing the boulder west but failed because barriers were in the way. The latest observation after trying to push west again resulted in a message saying the boulder couldn't be moved.

Looking at the map, the agent is near a boulder at (40,15) adjacent to east and southwest. The fountain is adjacent to south and west. So the boulder is right next to the agent's current position. To push the boulder onto the fountain, the agent needs to move it west towards the fountain. But earlier attempts to push west didn't work, maybe because there's a barrier blocking the path behind the boulder.

Wait, the map shows bars adjacent north and northwest. So the boulder might be against a wall or barrier when trying to push west. If the agent is trying to push the boulder west but there's a bar (wall) north or northwest, that would prevent movement. The agent might need to move in a different direction first to create space.

Alternatively, maybe the agent is next to the boulder but needs to position themselves correctly. Let me check the cursor position again. The agent is at (40,15), and the boulder is adjacent east and southwest. So the boulder is to the east or southwest of the agent. To push it towards the fountain (south and west), the agent should push the boulder southwest. But how to do that?

Wait, in Boxoban, you push by moving into the boulder when there's space behind it. So if the agent is next to the boulder and there's empty space behind, they can push. If pushing west is blocked by bars, maybe pushing in another direction first would work. For example, move south to get the boulder out of the way, then push it west.

Looking at the language observation, the bars are adjacent north and northwest. So the boulder might be against a bar when trying to push north or northwest. The agent is at (40,15), and the boulder is adjacent east and southwest. So the boulder is likely at (41,15) east or (40,16) southwest. If the agent is at (40,15), and the boulder is to the east at (41,15), pushing west would require the agent to move into the boulder, which they did before, but the message said it failed. Maybe because the space behind the boulder (west of it) is blocked by bars.

Alternatively, if the boulder is to the southwest at (40,16), pushing it southwest would require moving the agent to (40,15) and pushing the boulder to (39,16), but there might be barriers there.

The fountain is adjacent south and west. So the agent needs to get the boulder to the southwest direction towards the fountain. Perhaps moving south first to clear the path, then pushing the boulder west. But the agent tried moving south earlier, and the cursor is now at (40,16). Wait, in the last observation, after moving south, the cursor was at (40,16). Then moving west resulted in trying to push the boulder but failing.

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to reposition. Let's look at the map again. The agent's position is marked with '<' at (40,15). The boulder is at (41,15) (since it's adjacent east). The bars are adjacent north and northwest, meaning there's a bar at (40,14) north and (39,15) northwest. So pushing the boulder west from (41,15) would require moving it to (40,15), but the agent is already there. Wait, no—the agent is at (40,15), and the boulder is at (41,15) (east). So to push the boulder west, the agent needs to move into it, which would push it to (40,15). But the agent is already there. That can't be right. Maybe the boulder is at (40,14) southwest? No, the cursor is at (40,15), and the boulder is adjacent east and southwest. So if the agent is at (40,15), the boulder could be at (40,14) (southwest) or (41,15) (east). Let me clarify:

The 'boulder adjacent east and southwest' means the boulder is next to the agent's current position in those directions. So east would be (41,15), and southwest would be (40,16) or (39,15). Wait, southwest from (40,15) is (40,16) if moving diagonally, but in grid-based movement, southwest would be (39,16). But the agent is on a grid where movement is north, south, east, west. So adjacent cells are directly up, down, left, right. So southwest would actually be (40,16) if moving down and right, but in standard grid terms, southwest is down and left. Hmm, maybe the description uses ""southwest"" as the cell to the south and west of the agent. So from (40,15), southwest would be (39,16). But the boulder is adjacent east and southwest, meaning the boulder is at (41,15) (east) and (39,16) (southwest). That seems possible, but the map shows the boulder very near westsouthwest, which would be further away.

Alternatively, perhaps the boulder is at (39,15) which is west of the agent's current position (40,15). If the boulder is at (39,15) (west), then the agent is at (40,15), and pushing east into the boulder would move it to (41,15). But the previous attempts to push west resulted in failure, which might indicate the boulder is already being pushed east. Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me try to parse the observations again.

The latest observation after moving south to (40,16) shows the boulder adjacent west. So at (40,16), the boulder is to the west, meaning at (39,16). The agent is trying to push it west, but there's a barrier. The bars adjacent southeast, south, and southwest suggest there are barriers in those directions. So pushing the boulder west from (39,16) would require moving it to (38,16), but if there's a bar there, it's blocked.

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to find a way to move the boulder around the barriers. Since the fountain is to the south and west, perhaps pushing the boulder southwest. But the agent's current position is (40,15), and the boulder is at (39,15) (west). If the agent moves west to (39,15), then can push the boulder southwest to (38,16), but there might be bars there.

This is tricky. The key is to move the boulder onto the fountain adjacent south and west. The fountain is at a location south or west of the boulder. The agent needs to position the boulder so that it's on the fountain. Given the barriers, the agent might need to navigate around them.

Another approach: check the inventory. The agent has a sword, lance, shield, etc., but no keys or other items that might help remove barriers. So the solution must involve pushing the boulder through valid paths.

Looking at the map, the agent is surrounded by bars on the north and northwest. To the east is the boulder. To the south is the fountain. So perhaps the agent needs to push the boulder south towards the fountain. But the boulder is adjacent east, so the agent needs to move into it from the west. If the agent moves west to (39,15), then can push the boulder south to (39,16). But is (39,16) a valid position? The bars are adjacent southeast, south, and southwest at the agent's current position (40,15), which might mean barriers at (41,16), (40,16), and (39,16). If that's the case, pushing the boulder south from (39,15) to (39,16) would be blocked.

Alternatively, maybe the barriers are not in all those directions. The language observation says ""bars adjacent southeast, south, and southwest"" at the agent's current position (40,15). So those bars are at (40,16) south, (41,16) southeast, and (39,16) southwest. So pushing the boulder south from (39,15) to (39,16) would hit the bar at (39,16), making it impossible.

In that case, the agent needs to find another way. Maybe move the boulder east first, but earlier attempts to push east resulted in failure. Wait, the boulder is adjacent east, so pushing east would require the agent to move into it, pushing it to (42,15). But is there space there? The bars are far north, etc., but the map shows a lot of bars, so maybe east of the boulder is blocked.

Alternatively, the agent could move north, but there's a bar adjacent north, so that's blocked.

Hmm. This is challenging. The agent needs to get the boulder to the fountain at south and west. Given the barriers, perhaps the only way is to push the boulder west towards the fountain. But the agent is at (40,15), and the boulder is to the west at (39,15). To push it west, the agent would move into (39,15), pushing the boulder to (38,15). But is (38,15) passable? The map doesn't show bars there, but there might be dark areas or other obstacles. The language observation mentions dark areas far north, west, and northwest, but not specifically at (38,15).

Alternatively, maybe the agent should move south to (40,16) and then try to push the boulder west from there. If the boulder is at (39,15), moving the agent to (40,16) and then pushing west would require the agent to be adjacent to the boulder. But the boulder is at (39,15), so from (40,16), the boulder is to the northwest. Pushing it west would require the agent to move northwest into the boulder, which isn't a valid action since movement is only north, south, east, west.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe the best action is to keep trying to push the boulder in a direction that might work. Since previous attempts to push west failed due to barriers, perhaps trying to push the boulder south. If the agent moves west to (39,15), then pushes the boulder south to (39,16), but that's blocked by a bar. Alternatively, push the boulder east, but that's also blocked.

Wait, another idea: the agent's current position is (40,15), and the fountain is adjacent south and west. The boulder is adjacent east and southwest. If the boulder is at (41,15) (east), then pushing it west would move it to (40,15), but the agent is already there. That's not possible. So maybe the boulder is at (40,14) (south), but the agent is at (40,15). Then pushing north into the boulder would move it to (40,14), but there's a bar adjacent north, so that's blocked.

I think the correct approach here is to move the agent to the position where they can push the boulder in the desired direction. Since the fountain is to the south and west, and the boulder is to the east or southwest, the agent needs to reposition to be next to the boulder in a direction where pushing will lead it towards the fountain.

Given the agent's current position at (40,15), and the boulder adjacent east and southwest, if the boulder is at (41,15) (east), the agent can move west to (39,15), then push east into the boulder, moving it to (40,15), but that's where the agent is. Not helpful. Alternatively, if the boulder is at (39,15) (west), the agent is already adjacent and can push east into it, moving it to (40,15), which is occupied. So that's not possible.

Wait, maybe the boulder is at (40,16) (south). Then the agent can move south to (40,16) and push north into the boulder, but there's a bar adjacent north at (40,14). So that's blocked.

This is really confusing. Maybe the best action is to try pushing the boulder in a different direction. Since previous attempts to push west failed, perhaps try pushing south. If the boulder is at (41,15) (east), pushing it south to (41,16). Is that possible? The agent would need to move into the boulder from the north, pushing it south. The agent is at (40,15), moves north to (39,15), then pushes south into the boulder at (41,15)? No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, the agent could move east to (41,15), then push west into the boulder, but that's where they started. Hmm.

Wait, the latest observation after moving south to (40,16) shows the boulder adjacent west. So the boulder is at (39,16). The agent is at (40,16). To push the boulder west, the agent needs to move into it from the east, which would push it to (38,16). But is there a barrier there? The language observation says bars are adjacent southeast, south, and southwest at (40,15), which are (41,16), (40,16), and (39,16). So (39,16) is a bar? No, the boulder is at (39,16), and the bars are adjacent to the agent's position (40,15). So the bar at (40,16) is a barrier, meaning the agent can't move south into it. But the boulder is at (39,16), which is west of the agent at (40,16). So pushing the boulder west from (39,16) would require moving it to (38,16), but there's no information about barriers there. If that's a valid space, then pushing west is possible.

Assuming that pushing the boulder west from (39,16) to (38,16) is possible, the agent should move to (39,16) and push west. But how to get there? The agent is at (40,16). They can move west to (39,16), then push the boulder west to (38,16). If that space is clear, then the boulder would be moved towards the fountain located south and west. However, the fountain is adjacent south and west at the agent's current position (40,15), which is south to (40,16) and west to (39,15). So if the boulder is moved to (38,16), it's not adjacent to the fountain. The fountain is at (39,15) south and west of the agent's original position.

This is getting too complex without seeing the actual map layout clearly. Based on the previous map descriptions, the agent needs to find a path to push the boulder towards the fountain. Given the barriers, the most feasible action might be to keep trying to push the boulder in the direction that seems closest to the fountain, which is west or south.

Considering the agent's current position (40,15) and the boulder adjacent east and southwest, if the boulder is to the east at (41,15), pushing it west towards the fountain at (40,15) is occupied by the agent. That's not possible. If the boulder is to the southwest at (39,16), pushing it west to (38,16) might be the way, but need to check for barriers.

Alternatively, move the agent south to (40,16) and then try to push the boulder west from there. If the boulder is at (39,16), pushing it west to (38,16). If that's allowed, then the action would be 'push west'. However, the previous attempt to push west resulted in a failure message, possibly due to a barrier.

Given the information, the best action is to try pushing the boulder west again, as that's the direction towards the fountain. Even though it failed before, maybe there was a misunderstanding in the barrier positions. Alternatively, move the agent to a different position to create space.

But according to the tip, avoiding repeating the same action if nothing changes. The agent has already tried 'west' and 'push west' multiple times without success. So perhaps a different approach is needed.

Another possibility is that the boulder is already in a position where it's on a fountain, but the observations don't indicate that. The fountain is very near eastsoutheast, so maybe the boulder needs to be moved there.

Wait, the latest message after pushing west said ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" Which implies that the boulder couldn't be moved because there's an obstacle behind it. So the boulder is pushed against a barrier or another object.

In Boxoban, you can't push a boulder into a wall or another boulder. So the agent needs to ensure there's space behind the boulder when pushing.

Given that, the agent should move to a position where pushing the boulder will have space behind it. For example, if the boulder is at (41,15), and there's an empty space at (42,15), then the agent can push it east. But the observations don't show that.

Alternatively, if the boulder is at (39,15) (west of the agent), and there's space to the southwest at (38,15), the agent can push it southwest.

But without knowing the exact map layout, it's hard to say. based on the latest map description, the agent is at (40,15), and the boulder is adjacent east and southwest. The map shows '#....{@.`#' which might indicate the boulder at position (40,15) with '@' being the agent and '{' the boulder. So the boulder is at (40,15), but that can't be right because the agent is there. Maybe the map symbol notation is different. Often, in these games, '@' is the agent, '$' is a boulder, and '.' is floor. The map line shows '#....{@.`#', which might mean that in that row, the agent is at position with '@', and the boulder is at the position before that, perhaps '{' is a wall or another object. This is getting too ambiguous.

Given the uncertainty, the safest action is to continue trying to push the boulder in the direction that seems most plausible towards the fountain. Since the fountain is south and west, and the boulder is adjacent east and southwest, perhaps pushing southwest would be the way. But the allowed actions are only north, south,","

Let's try to figure out what to do next. The agent is in Boxoban, trying to push the boulders onto the fountains. The current position is (40, 15), and the boulder is adjacent to the southwest. The agent already tried pushing west before but couldn't because of barriers.

Looking at the map, there are bars surrounding the area to the north and northwest. The boulder is near westsouthwest and westnorthwest. The fountain is adjacent to south and west. The agent needs to get the boulder closer to the fountain. 

The last valid action was 'north', but that hit a bar. Maybe moving south could help? But moving south brings the agent back to y=16, which might not be better. Alternatively, trying to push the boulder to the west might be possible if there's a clear path behind it. But the problem is there are bars adjacent to the northwest, blocking that direction. 

Wait, the boulder is adjacent to southwest. If the agent moves west, maybe they can push the boulder southwest. Let me check the language observation again. It says the boulder is adjacent southwest. So if the agent is at (40,15) and moves west to (39,15), then pushes west, the boulder would go to (38,15). But is there a fountain there? The fountain is adjacent south and west. If the boulder is pushed west, maybe it can reach the west fountain. 

But the bars adjacent to northwest might still block the path. The bars very near include north, northeast, southeast, etc. So pushing the boulder west would require the agent to position themselves correctly. Let me visualize the area. The agent is at (40,15), the boulder is at (39,15) or (38,15)? The previous observations show the boulder adjacent east and southwest. Wait, in the last observation, the boulder is adjacent southwest, so maybe it's at (40,15) but that's the agent's position. Wait, no— the cursor is at the agent's position, and the boulder is adjacent southwest. So the boulder is likely at (40,14) or (39,15). 

Hmm, maybe moving south to y=16 and then trying to push the boulder west? But the bars are present in various areas. Alternatively, the agent could try moving southwest but since movement is only in cardinal directions, that's not possible. 

Wait, the agent's inventory has a +1 long sword and other items, but in Boxoban, you usually just need to push boulders. The key is to find a path where the boulder can be pushed towards the fountain without hitting bars. Since the fountain is adjacent south and west, maybe pushing the boulder west into the west fountain. But the agent needs to be next to the boulder and have space behind it. 

The current position is (40,15). If the boulder is adjacent southwest, then it's probably at (39,15). To push it west, the agent needs to be at (39,15) and move west, pushing the boulder to (38,15). But the agent is at (40,15). So the agent should move west to (39,15) first. But when they tried moving west earlier, they couldn't push the boulder because it's already adjacent. Wait, in the previous steps, moving east when the boulder was adjacent caused a failure. So maybe the agent needs to get next to the boulder in the correct direction to push it. 

Alternatively, if the boulder is at (40,14), then pushing it west would require the agent to be at (40,14) and move west. But the agent is at (40,15). Moving south to (40,16) and then west? But the bars are in the way. 

Another idea: Look at the map. The boulder is very near westsouthwest. The fountain is adjacent west. So maybe the boulder is near the west edge, and pushing it further west into the fountain. But there are bars blocking the path. Unless the bars are not in the way when pushing the boulder. 

Wait, the message when trying to push west previously was ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" Which suggests that there's an obstacle behind the boulder. So the boulder can't be pushed in that direction because there's something blocking. The bars adjacent northwest might be behind the boulder. 

So the agent needs to find a way to reposition the boulder such that there's no obstacle behind it when pushing. Maybe move the agent in a different direction to create space. For example, move north to y=14, then try pushing the boulder west. But the bars are still there. 

Alternatively, check if there's a clear path to the fountain. The fountain is adjacent west, so if the boulder can be pushed all the way west to the fountain, that would solve the problem. But the bars are in the way. Unless the boulder can be pushed around the bars. 

Wait, the bars are far north, northnortheast, etc., but the very near bars include northwest. So the boulder can't be pushed northwest because of those bars. Maybe pushing the boulder south towards the fountain. If the agent moves the boulder south into the fountain. But the fountain is adjacent south and west. 

The agent is at (40,15). The boulder is adjacent southwest, so perhaps at (39,15). If the agent moves west to (39,15), then pushes west to (38,15), but then the next position (37,15) must be free. But the language observation says bars very near include southwest, so maybe (38,15) is blocked. 

This is tricky. The agent needs to find a way to maneuver the boulder towards the fountain without hitting bars. Since previous attempts to push west failed, maybe try moving the agent in a different direction to get a better angle. For example, move south to y=16, then try pushing the boulder west. But the bars are still present. 

Alternatively, check if there's a different boulder. The observation mentions a boulder very near westsouthwest and another adjacent east. The agent's goal is to push all boulders to fountains. So maybe there are multiple boulders. The one adjacent east might need to be pushed to the southeast fountain. 

But in the current state, the agent is focused on the southwest boulder. Maybe the correct action is to keep trying to push west, but the barriers are making it impossible. Perhaps the agent needs to move around the boulder to a different side. For example, move south to get behind the boulder and then push it north or west. 

Alternatively, since the stairs are nearby at westsouthwest, maybe the agent needs to use them to go down, but the problem is on level 1. 

Another possibility: The agent might have to push the boulder into the fountain that's adjacent south. So moving the boulder south into the fountain. But the boulder is currently adjacent southwest, so moving it south would require the agent to be at (40,15) and push the boulder south to (40,14). Is (40,14) a fountain? The fountain is adjacent south and west, so (40,14) would be south of the agent's current position, which is adjacent to the fountain. If the boulder is pushed south to (40,14), which is adjacent to the fountain at (40,13), then that would place the boulder on the fountain. 

But can the agent push the boulder south? The agent is at (40,15), the boulder is at (39,15) (assuming adjacent southwest). Wait, adjacent southwest would be (39,14), perhaps. This is getting confusing. Maybe the map can help. 

Looking at the map, the agent's position is marked with `<` at (40,15). The boulder is marked with `@` at (40,15) adjacent southwest, so maybe the boulder is at (39,15). To push it southwest would require the agent to be at (39,15) and move southwest, but movement is only cardinal. So to push west, the agent needs to be west of the boulder. 

So the agent needs to move to (39,15), then push west to (38,15). But is (38,15) clear? The language observation says bars very near include northwest, so maybe (38,15) is blocked. 

Alternatively, if the boulder is at (40,14), then pushing it south to (40,13) which is a fountain. But how to get there? The agent would need to move to (40,14) and push south. 

This is getting a bit complex. Given the previous failures, maybe the best action is to try pushing the boulder in a different direction, perhaps south. Or move around to find a clear path. 

Since the last valid action was north which hit a bar, maybe moving south to y=16 could open up a path. But the observation after moving south didn't show any change. 

Alternatively, the agent could try moving west again, but the boulder might be stuck. Maybe the key is to find that the boulder can be pushed into the fountain by moving it south. 

Given the current position and the need to avoid bars, perhaps the best action is to push the boulder south into the adjacent fountain. So the agent should move to the boulder's position and push south. 

But the agent is at (40,15), and the boulder is adjacent southwest. So if the boulder is at (39,15), the agent needs to move west to (39,15) and then push south to (39,14), which is a fountain. 

Assuming that (39,14) is a fountain, pushing the boulder there would solve the problem. 

So the steps would be: move west to (39,15), then push south. 

But in the current state, the agent is at (40,15). Moving west once gets to (39,15), then pushing south would move the boulder to (39,14). 

The language observation mentions that the fountain is adjacent south and west. So if the boulder is pushed south to (39,14), which is south of (39,15), and the fountain is at (39,13) (south of that), then that would place the boulder on the fountain. 

Therefore, the correct action is to move west to (39,15) and then push south. However, the agent can only perform one action at a time. So first, move west, then push south. 

But the previous attempts to push west failed, possibly because the agent wasn't next to the boulder correctly. 

In the current observation, the agent is at (40,15), and the boulder is adjacent southwest. So the boulder is likely at (39,15). Therefore, moving west to (39,15) is necessary to push it. 

So the next action should be 'west' to get next to the boulder, then 'push south'. But since the agent can only choose one action now, the immediate action is to move west. 

However, earlier attempts to move west resulted in trying to push the boulder but failing. Wait, no—the messages when moving west were ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" Which implies that the agent was trying to push it while adjacent, but there was an obstacle. 

So maybe the agent needs to move west first to get next to the boulder, then push in the desired direction. 

Given that, the correct action now is to move west to (39,15), which would position the agent next to the boulder, allowing a push in a cardinal direction. 

Therefore, the chosen action is 'west'.

",-0.001,False
54,west,"<reasoning>
Let's see. I need to push a boulder onto a fountain in Boxoban. The player is a knight at position (39,15) looking west. The map shows various bars and fountains around.

Looking at the observations, there's a boulder adjacent to the southwest. The fountain is adjacent to the southeast. The bars are blocking some directions, especially north and northwest. The previous attempts to push west resulted in messages saying the boulder couldn't be moved, probably because there's an obstacle behind it.

Wait, the latest cursor position is (39,15) after moving west. The boulder is adjacent southwest, which would be at (38,14). To push the boulder towards the fountain to the southeast (40,16), maybe I need to free up the path. The bars are in the way north and northwest, so moving south or east might help.

Alternatively, maybe the boulder is stuck because there's something behind it. If I can move the boulder southwest towards the fountain, but the message says it's impossible. Perhaps the path isn't clear. Let me check the map again. The map shows a `@` at (39,15), and the boulder is at (38,14) (southwest). The fountain is at (40,16) (southeast). The bars are adjacent north and northwest, so moving north or northwest is blocked.

Maybe I need to move the boulder south to (38,16), then east? But the current position is (39,15). If I push the boulder southwest, that's towards (38,14), but the fountain is at (40,16). Wait, the fountain is adjacent southeast. So the boulder needs to be moved to (40,16). But the boulder is at (38,14). How to get it there?

Possible path for the boulder: From (38,14), push east to (39,14), then east to (40,14), then south to (40,15), then south to (40,16) which is the fountain. But the agent is at (39,15). Let me see if the agent can move to push the boulder in that direction.

The agent is at (39,15). To push the boulder from (38,14) eastward, the agent needs to be adjacent. The boulder is southwest of the agent. So to push it east, the agent needs to move east first? Wait, the agent is at (39,15). The boulder is at (38,14). To push the boulder southwest (which would be towards the agent's current position), but that's not helpful. Maybe the agent needs to move to the boulder's position and push it in the desired direction.

Alternatively, perhaps the agent should move south to (39,16) and then push the boulder east. But the map shows that moving south from (39,15) is allowed. Let me check the previous observations. When the agent moved south to (40,16), there was no block. But in the current state, the agent is at (39,15). If I move south to (39,16), then perhaps push the boulder east from there.

Wait, the boulder is at (38,14). To push it east, the agent would need to be at (38,15) and move east into the boulder. Then the boulder would move to (39,15). But the agent is currently at (39,15), which is occupied by the agent. So that's not possible. Maybe the agent needs to move west to (38,15), then push the boulder east into (39,15), then proceed further.

But the agent just moved west to (39,15) and then tried pushing west, which failed because there's a bar. So perhaps the path is blocked by bars north and northwest. The agent might need to find a way around the bars to manipulate the boulder.

Another approach: The fountain is at (40,16). The boulder is at (38,14). The agent is at (39,15). To get the boulder to (40,16), the path would be east, east, south, south. But the bars are in the way north and northwest. Maybe the agent needs to move around the bars to access the boulder's path.

Alternatively, maybe the boulder is already adjacent to the fountain, but the observation says the fountain is adjacent southeast. The boulder adjacent southwest would be at (38,14), which is not near the fountain. So the boulder needs to be moved southeast.

Hmm. The agent is at (39,15). To push the boulder from (38,14) to (39,14), the agent needs to be at (38,15) and move east. So the agent should move west to (38,15), then push east into the boulder, moving it to (39,15). But the agent is already at (39,15), so that's occupied. Therefore, the agent needs to move west to (38,15) first.

But in the current observation, after moving west to (39,15), the next move was push west, which failed. So the agent is at (39,15) with the boulder at (38,14). To push the boulder east, the agent must be adjacent to it. The only way is to move west to (38,15), then push east.

So the sequence would be: west to (38,15), then push east. This would move the boulder to (39,15), which is where the agent is. But that's not possible because the agent can't be in two places. Wait, when you push a boulder, you move into the boulder's space, and it moves in the direction you pushed. So if the agent is at (38,15) and pushes east, the boulder moves from (38,14) to (39,14), and the agent moves into (38,14). But that might not help.

Alternatively, if the agent is at (39,15) and pushes the boulder southwest (which is where it's already located), but that direction is blocked by the agent's position. So that's not possible.

I think the correct approach is to move the agent to the boulder's position and then push it in the desired direction. So from (39,15), move west to (38,15), then push east into the boulder, which would move it to (39,15), allowing the agent to then move into the boulder's previous position and continue pushing. However, this might require multiple steps.

But given the previous attempts, the agent is stuck because pushing west isn't working. Maybe the agent should try moving south to (39,16) and then see if pushing the boulder east from there is possible. Let's check: from (39,16), pushing the boulder east would require the boulder to be at (39,15), which it's not. The boulder is at (38,14), so that's not adjacent.

Alternatively, move south to (39,16), then west to (38,16), then push east into the boulder at (38,14)? No, that's not adjacent.

This is getting confusing. Let me recap:

- Agent is at (39,15)
- Boulder is at (38,14) (southwest of agent)
- Fountain is at (40,16) (southeast)
- Bars block north and northwest, so moving those directions is impossible.

To get the boulder to the fountain, need to move it east and south. From (38,14), push east to (39,14), then east to (40,14), then south to (40,15), then south to (40,16).

The agent needs to be adjacent to the boulder to push it. So first, move the agent to (38,15) (west of the boulder), then push east into the boulder, moving it to (39,14). Then the agent can move to (39,14) and push east again to (40,14), and so on.

But in the current state, the agent is at (39,15). So the steps would be:

1. Move west from (39,15) to (38,15).
2. Push east into the boulder at (38,14), moving it to (39,14).
3. Move east from (38,15) to (39,15) (now empty).
4. Move east to (40,15).
5. Push south into the boulder at (40,14) (but the boulder is now at (39,14)), so need to adjust.

This is getting complicated. Maybe the immediate action is to move the agent west to (38,15) to get adjacent to the boulder and then push it east.

I need to figure out the best move here. Let's look at the current situation.

The agent is a knight at position (38,15). The map shows several bars, dark areas, stairs, and fountains. The main goal is to push boulders onto fountains. 

Looking at the observations, there's a boulder adjacent to the southeast and south. The fountains are near east and eastsoutheast. The bars are blocking many paths, especially to the north. The stairs are up westsouthwest, which might not be necessary right now since the goal is to push boulders.

The agent just moved west twice to get to (38,15). The boulder is at (38,15) adjacent southeast and south. To push a boulder, the agent needs to move into it, which would push the boulder in the direction they're moving. 

If I try to push the boulder to the east, that might get it closer to the fountain at eastsoutheast. But the current position of the boulder is southeast and south of the agent. Wait, the boulder adjacent southeast and south—so the agent is at (38,15), and the boulder is to the southeast (probably (39,16)) and south (39,15)? Or maybe (38,16) and (39,15)? Need to visualize the map.

The map shows that at (38,15) the agent's position has '@', and the boulder is marked '{' which is adjacent. The message mentioned a boulder adjacent southeast and south. So moving east would push the boulder east, but east might be blocked by bars. Let me check the bars around here.

The language observation says bars very near north, northeast, etc. The adjacent bars are to the north, northeast, and northwest. So moving north or east might be blocked. The south and southwest have a boulder and fountain. 

If the agent moves south, they can try to push the boulder to the southwest towards the fountain. Alternatively, moving east might help if there's a path. But the east direction seems blocked by bars as per previous observations.

Another option is to check the fountain positions. The fountain is adjacent east, so if the boulder can be pushed east into that fountain, that would solve the problem. However, moving east from (38,15) would take the agent to (39,15), where there's a boulder. Wait, the boulder is adjacent southeast and south. Maybe the boulder is at (39,15) and (39,16). If the agent moves east to (39,15), they can try to push the boulder further east. But east of (39,15) might be a bar or another obstacle.

Looking at the map again, the agent's current position is at (38,15) with '@', and the boulder is marked '{' to the southeast (perhaps (39,16)) and south (39,15). The fountain is adjacent east, which would be (39,15)'s east, but (39,15) has a boulder. So maybe pushing the boulder from (39,15) east into the fountain at (40,15)? But the bars adjacent north and northwest might block that path. 

Alternatively, moving south to (38,16) and then pushing the boulder southwest towards the fountain at southeast. But I need to ensure there's a clear path behind the boulder. If the boulder is at (39,15), pushing it south would take it to (39,16), which might be towards the fountain at southeast. 

Wait, the fountain is adjacent southeast, which would be (39,16) or (40,16). If the boulder is at (39,15), pushing it south to (39,16) could get it closer to the fountain. Then from there, maybe push further. 

But the agent is currently at (38,15). To push the boulder south, the agent needs to move south into the boulder. So moving south to (38,16), then the boulder at (39,15) would be pushed to (39,16). Then from there, the agent can move to (39,16) and push south again towards the fountain. 

Alternatively, if the agent moves east to (39,15), which has the boulder, then tries to push east, but east might be blocked by bars. 

Hmm, considering the bars adjacent to the agent's current position (north, northeast, northwest), moving north is blocked. Moving east is blocked by bars. So the best options are south or west. 

But the boulder is to the southeast and south. If the agent moves south to (38,16), they can then try to push the boulder south into (39,16), which might be towards the fountain. Then from there, continue pushing. 

Alternatively, move west again, but the agent was already moving west and encountered the boulder. 

Another possibility is that the boulder adjacent southeast is at (39,16), and pushing it west into a fountain. But the fountain is adjacent east, so maybe not. 

Wait, the fountain is adjacent southeast, which would be (38,16) southeast? No, coordinates are a bit confusing. Let me think in terms of the map grid. The agent is at (38,15). Southeast would be (39,16), and the fountain is there. So if the boulder is at (39,16), pushing it west into the fountain at (38,16). But how to get to that position. 

The agent is at (38,15). To get to (39,16), they need to move east then south, but east is blocked by bars. Alternatively, move south to (38,16), then east to (39,16), but east from (38,16) might be possible if there's no bar. 

Looking at the bars very near north, northeast, etc., the adjacent bars are to the north, northeast, and northwest. So from (38,15), moving south to (38,16) is possible. Then from (38,16), moving east to (39,16) might be possible if there's no bar there. 

If the agent moves south to (38,16), then east to (39,16), and if there's no bar, they can push the boulder at (39,16) west into the fountain at (38,16). That seems like a good plan. 

So the steps would be: 
1. Move south to (38,16)
2. Move east to (39,16)
3. Push west to move the boulder from (39,16) to (38,16), which is the fountain.

But need to check if the path is clear. From (38,15) south to (38,16): the map shows that the agent's current position is at (38,15) with '@', and the next row down (38,16) has '#....{..`#', which includes a '{' at (39,16), so the boulder is there. 

So moving south to (38,16) is possible. Then from (38,16), moving east to (39,16) would be into the boulder. But the agent can push the boulder by moving into it. So pushing east from (38,16) would move the boulder to (39,16), but that's where it's already. Wait, maybe the boulder is at (39,16), and the agent needs to push it west into the fountain at (38,16). 

So the correct action would be to move east from (38,16) to (39,16) and then push west. But first, the agent needs to get to (38,16). 

So first action: south to (38,16). Then from there, east to (39,16), then push west. 

Alternatively, the agent could try to push the boulder directly from (38,15) south into (39,16), but that would require moving south into the boulder. 

Wait, the boulder is adjacent south at (39,15). So if the agent is at (38,15), moving south to (38,16) won't push the boulder south. The boulder at (39,15) would only move if the agent is beside it and pushes. 

So the agent needs to get next to the boulder. The boulder is at (39,15) (south) and (39,16) (southeast). 

To push the boulder at (39,15) south to (39,16), the agent needs to be at (39,14) and move south into it. But the agent is at (38,15), so moving east to (39,15) and then south. But (39,15) has the boulder. So moving east into (39,15) would allow the agent to push the boulder south. 

So steps: 
1. Move east to (39,15) (which has the boulder)
2. Push south to move the boulder from (39,15) to (39,16)
3. Then from (39,16), push west into the fountain at (38,16)

But moving east from (38,15) to (39,15) is possible if there's no barrier. However, previous observations mentioned bars very near north, northeast, etc. The agent is at (38,15), adjacent bars are north, northeast, northwest. So moving east to (39,15) might be possible unless there's a bar there. 

Looking at the map, the row for (38,15) is ""#....{@.`#"" which suggests that east of (38,15) is a '.' or a path. Then (39,15) is part of the next row, which is ""#<..``{.{#"". So the character at (39,15) is '{', which is the boulder. So moving east from (38,15) to (39,15) is possible because it's a boulder, but to push it, the agent needs to move into it. 

Wait, no. The agent can move into the boulder to push it. So moving east from (38,15) to (39,15) would allow the agent to be next to the boulder, then push it further east or south. 

So the correct action here is to move east into (39,15) where the boulder is, then decide the direction to push. Since the fountain is adjacent east (which would be (40,15)), pushing the boulder east from (39,15) to (40,15) would place it on the fountain. But need to check if there's a clear path east of (39,15). 

Looking at the map, the east of (39,15) is part of the row ""#<..``{.{#"", which at (40,15) is '{', another boulder. Wait, no—the map shows that at (39,15) is '{' (boulder), and east of that would be (40,15), which is also '{' according to the map. So pushing the boulder east from (39,15) to (40,15) would be pushing into another boulder, which isn't possible. 

So that approach won't work. alternative is to push the boulder south from (39,15) to (39,16), which is towards the fountain at (39,16) southeast? Wait, the fountain is adjacent southeast, which would be (39,16)'s southeast, maybe (40,17)? Not sure. Alternatively, the fountain at (39,16) is adjacent east, which would be (40,16). 

This is getting a bit confusing. Let's try to outline the possible moves again. 

Current position: (38,15)
Boulders: one at (39,15) (south) and another at (39,16) (southeast)
Fountains: adjacent east (so (39,15)'s east is (40,15)) and adjacent southeast (maybe (39,16)'s east is (40,16))

The goal is to push a boulder onto a fountain. 

If the agent moves east to (39,15), which has the boulder, then pushes south to (39,16), that boulder is now at (39,16). From there, the agent can move to (39,16) and push west into the fountain at (38,16). 

So the steps would be:
1. east to (39,15)
2. push south to (39,16)
3. west to (38,16)
4. push west to (37,16), but need to check if there's a fountain there. 

But the fountain is adjacent southeast, which might be at (38,16) southeast, like (39,17). Not sure. Alternatively, the fountain at (39,16) is the one adjacent southeast. 

Alternatively, pushing the boulder from (39,16) west into (38,16), which might be a fountain. 

Assuming that (38,16) is a fountain, pushing the boulder there would solve the problem. 

So the agent needs to execute the following actions:
- Move east to (39,15)
- Push south to (39,16)
- Move west to (38,16)
- Push west to (38,16) into the fountain. 

But the agent's current position is (38,15). So first action is to move east. 

But earlier attempts to push west resulted in ""You cannot pass through the bars."" So moving east might be possible. 

The previous observations showed that after moving west, the agent was at (38,15), and there was a boulder adjacent southeast and south. 

So the best action now is to move east into (39,15) where the boulder is, then push it south to (39,16), then push it west into the fountain. 

Therefore, the first action should be to move east.

56,south,"<reasoning>
Let's try to figure out what the agent should do next. The goal is to push the boulders onto the fountains in Boxoban. From the observations, there's a boulder adjacent to the southeast and south. The agent is currently at (39, 15) and there's a boulder at (38,15) to the west. The map shows some bars and dark areas, which are probably walls or obstacles that can't be passed through.

The message mentions that trying to move the boulder earlier failed because of bars, so maybe the boulder is blocked by something else. The agent tried pushing west before but got a message that it couldn't move the boulder. Wait, the message said ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" So perhaps there's another obstacle behind the boulder that's preventing it from being moved further west.

Looking at the map, the agent is at position (39,15) with a boulder at (40,15). The agent moved west to (39,15) and then tried pushing west again, but it didn't work. Maybe the boulder is against a wall or another boulder. The cursor is now at (39,15) after moving west, and the boulder is at (40,15), which was previously at (41,14) initially.

The agent needs to navigate to a position where they can push the boulder towards a fountain. The fountains are near eastsoutheast and southwest. The southwest fountain is adjacent, but the boulder there might be blocked. The eastsoutheast fountain is further away. Alternatively, there's a fountain adjacent to northwest, which is maybe the same as the one near west.

The agent's inventory has a long sword and a lance, but pushing boulders doesn't require attacking. The key is to find a path where the agent can push the boulder by moving into it from the front, ensuring there's space behind it. The bars mentioned are probably walls that can't be moved through. The agent needs to check the surrounding cells for possible movement directions that allow pushing the boulder.

Currently, the agent is at (39,15) with a boulder at (40,15). To push the boulder west, the agent would need to move west into it, but the cell behind the boulder (39,15) is where the agent is already standing. Wait, no, the boulder is at (40,15), so if the agent is at (39,15), pushing west would require the agent to move into (40,15) (the boulder) and then the boulder would move to (41,15). But earlier attempts to push west resulted in failure, which might mean that (41,15) is blocked by a bar or another obstacle.

Looking at the map, cell (41,15) is probably a bar or wall, hence why pushing the boulder there isn't possible. The agent needs to find another way to position the boulder. Maybe moving north or south to create a path. The agent was previously at (40,15) south of the current position. Moving south to (39,16) might reveal if there's space to push the boulder in a different direction.

Alternatively, the agent could move east to (40,15) where the boulder is, but that's occupied. The agent needs to find an adjacent cell that's free to allow pushing the boulder. Since pushing west isn't working due to bars, perhaps moving north or south and then trying to push in a different direction.

Looking at the language observation, there's a fountain adjacent to the southwest. The boulder at (40,15) is north of that fountain. If the agent can push the boulder south into the fountain, that would solve the problem. To do that, the agent would need to move south into the boulder's position, making the boulder move south into the fountain. However, the cell south of (40,15) is (40,16). Is that cell free?

From the current map, the cell (40,16) is shown with a '@' symbol, which is the agent's position. Wait, no, the agent is at (39,15) now. The boulder is at (40,15). The cell (40,16) would be south of the boulder. If that cell is free (not a wall or bar), then the agent can move south into the boulder, pushing it to (40,16). Then, check if (40,16) is a fountain. The language observation mentions a fountain adjacent to southwest, which might be at (40,16) or another position.

Alternatively, maybe the agent should move north to (39,14) to see if there's a path. But the initial moves were north, south, east, west, and the agent is circling around. The key is to identify the positions of the boulders and fountains precisely.

Looking at the cursor position and map, the agent is at (39,15), and the boulder is at (40,15). The fountain is adjacent to southwest, which might be at (39,14) or (38,14). If the agent can push the boulder south into (40,16), and if that's a fountain, then that would be the solution. Alternatively, moving the boulder west towards the fountain at (38,15) southwest, but that's blocked by bars.

Given the previous attempts to push west failed due to bars, the next best option is to try pushing the boulder south into (40,16). If that cell is free, the agent can move south into the boulder, pushing it south. Then check if (40,16) is a fountain. From the language observation, ""fountain adjacent southwest"" might mean the fountain is at (39,14) or similar. If the boulder is moved to (40,16), which is south, and if that's a fountain, then the goal is achieved.

So the plan is: move south to (40,15) (the boulder's current position), then push south to (40,16). But wait, the agent is currently at (39,15). To push the boulder south, the agent needs to move south into it. So the agent should first move south to (39,16), then push the boulder south to (40,16). But need to check if (39,16) is passable.

Looking at the map, the cell (39,16) is part of the map's layout. The map shows a '#' for walls, '.' for floor, '{' for boulders, '@' for the agent, and '<' for stairs. From the map provided, the agent's current position is at (39,15) with a boulder at (40,15). The cell (39,16) is likely a floor (.) or passable. If moving south to (39,16) is possible, then the agent can then push the boulder south into (40,16).

Alternatively, the agent could move east to (40,15) where the boulder is, but that's occupied. So moving south first to (39,16) seems necessary. Then, from there, push the boulder south.

Therefore, the next actions should be: south, then push south. But the agent needs to ensure that the path behind the boulder is clear. If (40,16) is a fountain, then pushing the boulder there would solve the problem. Given the observations mention fountains near eastsoutheast and southwest, and the agent is near the southwest fountain, moving the boulder there would be the solution.

In conclusion, the agent should move south to get behind the boulder and then push it south towards the fountain.

Let me try to figure out what to do next in this Boxoban game. So the goal is to push all the boulders onto the fountains. Looking at the map, the agent is at position (39,15). There's a boulder adjacent to the southwest. The fountains are southeast and southwest. The problem is that the boulders are stuck behind bars or other obstacles.

In the current observation, when I tried pushing the boulder west, the message said it's in vain. The bars are blocking the path. So maybe I need to find a way around the bars to position myself so I can push the boulder. Let's check the map again. The map shows a lot of '#' which are probably walls or obstacles. The bars are mentioned in various directions, so maybe moving in a direction that isn't blocked by bars would help.

The agent is near a staircase up to the westsouthwest, but I don't know if that's useful yet. The boulder is adjacent southwest, so maybe if I move south or west, but the bars are blocking the way. Alternatively, perhaps I can move east to get a better angle to push the boulder. Wait, but earlier attempts to push west resulted in failure because of the bars. Maybe I need to relocate the agent to a position where the boulder can be pushed without obstacles.

Looking at the cursor position, moving west again might not work. Let me check the adjacent directions. South is possible, but the boulder is already there. Maybe moving east to get next to the boulder and then push it west towards the fountain. But the fountain is southwest, so pushing the boulder southwest might be the way. However, the current position of the boulder is adjacent southwest, so it's already next to the fountain. Wait, the message says the fountain is adjacent southeast and southwest. If the boulder is adjacent southwest, then that should be on a fountain. But why can't I push it?

Wait, maybe the boulder is already on the fountain. If that's the case, then the game might be solved. But the initial problem was that the agent was trying to push it but failing. Maybe the boulder is stuck because of the bars. Alternatively, perhaps there's another boulder that's not yet on a fountain. Let me check the language observations again.

The language observation mentions ""boulder adjacent southwest"" and ""fountain adjacent southeast and southwest"". So the boulder is next to the southwest fountain, which means it's already on the target. Then why the message says ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain.""? That's confusing. Maybe there's another boulder that hasn't been placed yet. Let me check again.

The initial problem statement said the goal is to push all boulders onto fountains. The observations mention ""boulder adjacent east"" and ""boulder adjacent southwest"". So perhaps there are two boulders. One is adjacent east, and the other is adjacent southwest. The one adjacent southwest is on the fountain, but the east one isn't. However, in the current map, the agent is at (39,15), and the boulder adjacent east would be at (40,15), but the agent is there. Wait, no, the boulder is adjacent east, so maybe at (40,15). But the agent is at (39,15), so east would be (40,15), which is where the boulder is. But earlier when the agent tried to move east, it tried to push the boulder but failed. So the boulder is at (40,15), blocking the agent's path.

So the agent needs to move around the boulder to get to it. Let's see. The agent is at (39,15). The boulder is at (40,15). To push it west, the agent needs to be next to it and push. But the agent is already east of the boulder. So pushing west would move the boulder to (39,15), which is where the agent is. That's not possible because the agent can't be in two places at once. Wait, no, when you push a boulder, you move into the boulder's space, and the boulder moves into the space behind it. So if the agent is at (39,15) and the boulder is at (40,15), the agent can push the boulder west to (39,15) and themselves move to (40,15). But that would require the space behind the boulder (west of (40,15)) to be unoccupied. Looking at the map, the space at (39,15) is where the agent is, so it's occupied. Therefore, the boulder can't be pushed west because the agent is in the way.

So the solution is to move the agent out of the way. The agent is currently at (39,15). They need to move south or north to create space. Let's check the map. To the south of (39,15) is y=16. The cursor's position after moving south earlier was (39,16). The map shows a '#' at y=15, row 8, which is perhaps a wall. Wait, the map might be a bit confusing. Looking at the map section:

                              #....{@.`#                                    
                              #<..``{.{#                                    

These lines represent the agent's position. The '@' is at position (39,15) in the first line, and '<' is at (40,15) in the second line. So the boulder is at (40,15), which is the '<' character. The '@' is the agent. To push the boulder west, the agent needs to be at (40,15) and push west to (39,15), but the agent is already there. So that's not possible. Therefore, the agent needs to move to (40,15) to push the boulder. But to get there, the agent needs to move east, but that's blocked by the boulder. Wait, no, the agent is already at (39,15). To move east to (40,15), which is the boulder's location, they would have to move into it, but that's only possible if they push it. But pushing requires the space behind the boulder to be free.

Alternatively, maybe the agent can move south to (39,16) and then try to push the boulder from there. Let me check the map again. The agent is at (39,15), and moving south takes them to (39,16). The map at y=16 shows a '#' in the first line, which might be a wall. So moving south might be blocked by a wall. The cursor's position after moving south was (39,16), but the message didn't say anything about a wall. Hmm, maybe the south movement is possible.

Alternatively, the agent could move north. From (39,15), moving north to (39,14). Let's see if there's a path there. The map's northern parts have a lot of '#' which might be walls. It's unclear. The language observations mention bars far north, so moving north might be blocked.

Another approach: since the boulder at (40,15) can't be pushed west because the agent is in the way, the agent should move south to (39,16) and then try to push the boulder south. But looking at the map, the agent is at (39,15) and moving south to (39,16) would place them in a position where the boulder is at (40,15). Then pushing the boulder south to (40,16) if that space is free. However, the fountain is adjacent southeast and southwest, which might be in that direction. But I need to check if there are bars or other obstacles.

The language observation says ""bars very near north, northnortheast, northeast, southeast, southsoutheast, south, southsouthwest, southwest, westnorthwest, northwest, and northnorthwest"". So moving south from (40,15) to (40,16) might be possible if there are no bars there. The agent needs to check the adjacent directions. Since the agent is at (39,15), moving south to (39,16), then from there, pushing the boulder south to (40,16). But first, the agent needs to get to (40,15) to push it. However, moving east from (39,15) is blocked by the boulder.

Wait, maybe the agent can move around the boulder to the east and then push it. But the boulder is at (40,15), and moving east from the agent's position would take them into the boulder. Unless they can walk around it. But according to the game mechanics, you can't walk through boulders. So the agent has to find a path around the boulder.

Looking at the map, the agent is at (39,15), the boulder is at (40,15). To the east of the boulder is (41,15), which might be a wall or open space. If it's open, the agent could move east to (41,15), then maybe push the boulder west from there. But how? The agent would need to be adjacent to the boulder. If the agent is at (41,15), then the boulder is at (40,15), so the agent could push the boulder west to (39,15), which is where the agent is. That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, the agent could move to (40,16) and then push the boulder south or west.

This is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to summarize:

- Agent is at (39,15)
- Boulder is at (40,15) (adjacent east)
- Fountain is at southwest (adjacent to the boulder)
- Bars are blocking movement north and some other directions
- Need to push the boulder onto the fountain, which it's already adjacent to, but perhaps it's not on it yet? Or maybe there's another boulder.

Wait, the initial problem stated there's a boulder adjacent east and another adjacent southwest. The one adjacent southwest is on the fountain, but the east one isn't. So the agent needs to push the east boulder onto the fountain southeast.

To do that, the agent needs to get next to the east boulder and push it. But the agent is currently west of the boulder. So possible actions:

1. Move east to (40,15) to be next to the boulder, but that's occupied by the boulder, so can't move there unless pushing.
2. Move south to (39,16), then try to push the boulder south.
3. Move north to (39,14), then find a way around.

But moving south might be blocked by a wall. The cursor's position after moving south was (39,16), and the map shows a '#' at y=16, which might be a wall. So moving south from (39,15) to (39,16) is blocked by a wall. Therefore, that's not possible.

Moving north from (39,15) to (39,14). The map's northern parts have a lot of '#', so probably a wall there too.

Alternative idea: move west to (38,15), then see if there's a path to the boulder. From (38,15), the agent can move east to (39,15), then north or south. But the boulder is at (40,15), so moving east from (38,15) to (39,15), then east again is blocked by the boulder.

Alternatively, move west to (38,15), then south to (38,16), and see if that path is clear. If so, then from there, move east towards the boulder.

This is getting too convoluted. Maybe the best action is to keep trying to push the boulder in different directions. Since pushing west didn't work because of the agent's position, perhaps pushing south or north.

Wait, the boulder is at (40,15). If the agent is at (39,15), they can push the boulder west to (39,15), but that's where the agent is. So that's invalid. Alternatively, pushing south would require the space behind the boulder (south of (40,15)) to be free. If that space is free, the agent can push the boulder south to (40,16), and move into (40,15). Let's check if (40,16) is free. The map at y=16 shows a '#' in the first line, which might be a wall. So moving south from (40,15) is blocked by a wall. Therefore, the boulder can't be pushed south.

What about pushing north? The space north of (40,15) is (40,14). The map's northern part has '#'s, so likely a wall. Therefore, pushing north is blocked.

So the only possible direction is east, but the agent is already there. This is a problem. Maybe the agent needs to find another boulder. Wait, the initial observations mentioned a boulder adjacent east and another adjacent southwest. The one adjacent southwest is on the fountain, so the main issue is the east boulder. Since the agent can't push it west or south or north, maybe they need to find another way.

Wait, perhaps the agent needs to move to a different position to push the boulder. For example, move to (40,16) and then push the boulder west. But getting to (40,16) is blocked by a wall. Alternatively, move to (41,15) and then push the boulder west from there. But (41,15) is east of the boulder, so pushing west would move the boulder to (40,15), which is where the agent is. That doesn't work.

This is tricky. Maybe the solution is to move the agent to (40,15) by pushing the boulder, but that's not possible. Alternatively, the agent needs to use another item or ability. But the agent has a long sword and lance, but using combat isn't relevant here. The problem is purely about pushing boulders.

Another possibility: the agent is stuck because the boulder is in a corner with bars on multiple sides. In that case, the only way is to find a path around the bars to access the boulder from another direction.

Looking at the map, the agent is at (39,15). To the west is (38,15), which might be a free space. From (38,15), the agent can move north or south. If moving north to (38,14), which might be a free space, then from there, move east towards the boulder. But the bars are in various directions, so this might not be possible.

Alternatively, the agent could move south to (39,16), but that's blocked by a wall. So that's not an option.

Given the current constraints, the only possible movement is west, east, north, or south, but many are blocked. The last action was west, which moved the agent to (38,15). From there, maybe moving north or south.

Wait, the agent was at (38,15) after moving west. Let's check the map there. The map's line for y=15 is ""#....@..`#"". So at (38,15), the agent is in the fifth position (0-based index 4?), which is the '@'. Moving north from (38,15) to (38,14). The map's line for y=14 is not shown, but earlier lines have lots of '#', so likely a wall.

This is really challenging. Maybe the solution is to keep moving west until there's a free space to push the boulder. Alternatively, the agent needs to find the other boulder mentioned in the observation.

Wait, the initial problem said there's a boulder adjacent east and another adjacent southwest. The one adjacent southwest is on the fountain, so the main target is the east boulder. But the agent can't push it because it's stuck between bars and the agent's position.

In this case, perhaps the only way is to move the agent to a different position where they can push the boulder. For example, move to (40,16) if possible, but that's blocked. Alternatively, move to (41,15) and then push the boulder west, but that's not feasible.

Given all this, the safest bet might be to continue moving west to find a way around, or try pushing in a different direction even if it doesn't seem possible. Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to interact with the stairs up to the westsouthwest, but that's probably a different level and not relevant here.

After considering all options, the best action seems to be to keep trying to push the boulder in a direction that might work. Since pushing west from the current position didn't work, maybe pushing south or north. But both seem blocked. Alternatively, moving the agent to a different position to create space.

Wait, the agent is at (39,15). If they move south to (39,16), which might be possible if there's no wall, then from there, try to push the boulder south. But earlier moving south didn't result in a wall message, so maybe it's possible. Let me check the cursor position after moving south was (39,16), and the map showed a '#' at y=16, which might be a wall. So moving south is blocked.

In that case, the only possible movement is west or east. West takes the agent further away from the boulder, east is blocked by the boulder. This is a dead end. Maybe the agent needs to use a different strategy, like moving around the bars to access the boulder from another side.

Alternatively, perhaps the agent should pick up an item to help push the boulder, but the inventory doesn't show any relevant items. The agent has a sword and shield, which aren't useful for pushing.

Given the current information, the only viable action is to keep trying to push the boulder west, even though it's not working, or find a way to move around it. Since the agent can't push the boulder west from their current position, the next best step is to move the agent to a position where they can push it. For example, move east to (40,15) to be next to the boulder and then push west. But the agent can't move east into the boulder; they have to push it. So the correct action would be ""push east"", which would move the agent into (40,15) and the boulder into (41,15), if that space is free. Let me check if (41,15) is free.

Looking at the map, the line for y=15 is ""#....{@.`#"". So at (41,15), the character is '`', which is likely a floor space. Therefore, pushing east would move the boulder to (41,15), which is free. Then the agent would move into (40,15), next to the boulder. This could create a new opportunity to push the boulder further.

Wait, the agent's current position is (39,15). To push east, the agent needs to be adjacent to the boulder. The boulder is at (40,15). So pushing east would move the boulder","

Let's try to figure out what's going on here. The agent is in a Boxoban-like game, right? The goal is to push boulders onto fountains. The current map has a bunch of bars and dark areas, so probably walls or obstacles. The agent is a knight at position (39,15), looking north, northeast, etc.

Looking at the observations, there are boulders near westsouthwest and westnorthwest, and fountains southeast and southwest. The agent tried pushing west a few times but couldn't because of bars. The latest message says ""You cannot pass through the bars,"" so the agent is hitting a wall or obstacle when trying to move north.

The agent was at (40,15) and kept moving west, south, etc., but ended up stuck. The cursor is now at (39,15). The map shows the agent with @ and a boulder with {. The fountains are adjacent southeast and southwest, so maybe the boulders need to be moved towards those spots.

But the problem is the bars blocking the agent's path. The agent needs to navigate around the bars to get to the boulders. Since pushing west isn't working because of bars, maybe moving south or east could help. The stairs are up westsouthwest, but that might not be immediately useful.

Another approach: check if there's a way to get around the bars to access the boulders. The agent's inventory has items like a sword and shield, but in Boxoban, you just push boulders, so combat items might not be needed here. The key is to find an open path to the boulders and then push them towards the fountains.

Looking at the map, maybe moving south from (39,15) could lead to a clearer path. Alternatively, moving east might let the agent circle around the bars. But earlier attempts to move east didn't change the position, so perhaps there's a wall there too. 

The latest valid action was ""south,"" which didn't result in a message, so maybe moving south is possible. Let's try that again. If the agent moves south, maybe they can find a spot to push the boulder west into a fountain. Alternatively, moving east might reveal a path where the boulder can be pushed.

Wait, the boulder adjacent east. So there's a boulder near the agent's current position to the east. If the agent can move east past the bars, they could push that boulder. But the bars are blocking the way. Maybe the agent needs to find a different direction to approach the boulder.

Let me check the language observations again. The bars adjacent north and northwest. So the agent is north of the bars. The boulder is adjacent east. So to the east of the agent is a boulder. If the agent can move east, but the bars are in the way. Wait, the bars are very near north, etc. Maybe the agent can move east around the bars.

Alternatively, maybe the agent should try pushing the boulder to the south or west. But since the fountains are southeast and southwest, pushing the boulder towards those directions would be better. If the agent can move south and then push the boulder west, that might work.

But the agent is currently at (39,15). Moving south to (39,16) might be possible. Then, from there, if there's a path west, the agent could push the boulder. Let's see the map again. The map shows at position (39,15) the agent is at #@... and the boulder is at {. So maybe moving south to (39,16) where the map has `<..``{.{#`, which might be a path. Then from there, move west towards the boulder.

Alternatively, the agent could try moving east again, but previous attempts didn't change the position. Maybe there's a wall there. So the best bet is to move south to a position where there's a clear path to the boulder and then push it west or southwest towards the fountain.

59,push north,"<reasoning>
Let's try to figure out what to do next. The agent is in a Boxoban-like game, trying to push boulders onto fountains. From the observations, the key elements are:

- There's a boulder adjacent to the southwest.
- There's a fountain southeast and west.
- The agent (knight) is at (39,15). The boulder is southwest of the agent, so maybe at (38,16) or similar.
- The bars and dark areas are blocking movement in some directions, especially north and northwest.

The agent tried moving west multiple times but ended up against bars. Then moved south, but couldn't push the boulder. Now the cursor is back at (39,15). The goal is to push the boulder onto the fountain. The fountain is adjacent southeast and west. The boulder is adjacent southwest, so maybe the agent needs to move towards it to push.

But the agent is at (39,15). If the boulder is southwest, that would be to the left and down. Wait, the map shows the boulder adjacent southwest. So from the agent's position (39,15), southwest would be (38,16). But the agent is currently at (39,15). To get to the boulder at (38,16), the agent needs to move west (to 38,15) and then south (to 38,16). However, moving south from (39,15) might be blocked by bars or dark areas.

Looking at the language observation: bars adjacent north and northwest. So from (39,15), north is blocked by bars, northwest is blocked. So the agent can't go north or northwest. The boulder is southwest, so possibly the agent needs to move west to (38,15) and then check if they can push the boulder south to (38,16), which might be towards the fountain.

But when the agent tried moving west before, they ended up at (38,15) but then couldn't push the boulder. Maybe the boulder is stuck against another obstacle. Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to reposition to get a clear path to push the boulder towards the fountain.

Another approach: The fountain is adjacent southeast and west. If the boulder could be pushed west towards the fountain at (39,14), but the agent is at (39,15). So pushing the boulder west would require the agent to be to the east of the boulder. But the boulder is southwest of the agent, so it's to the left. Maybe the agent needs to move west to be next to the boulder, then push it south or west.

Wait, the agent's current position is (39,15). The boulder is adjacent southwest. So the boulder's position would be (38,16), perhaps. To push it, the agent needs to be adjacent to it and move in the direction opposite to where they want to push. So if the agent moves south to (39,16), then pushes the boulder north? But the bars are adjacent north, so that might not work.

Alternatively, if the agent moves west to (38,15), then they can try to push the boulder south to (38,16), which might be towards the fountain. But the agent tried moving west before and got a message that they couldn't push the boulder. Maybe the boulder is blocked by another obstacle there.

Looking at the map, the agent's current position is marked with @, and there's a boulder `{` adjacent southwest. The map shows `#` as walls or bars. The stairs are up near westsouthwest, but the agent's goal is to push boulders to fountains.

Perhaps the correct move is to try pushing the boulder west towards the fountain. To do that, the agent needs to be to the east of the boulder. If the boulder is at (38,16), the agent would need to move to (38,15) and then push west. But earlier attempts to move west resulted in the agent being unable to push the boulder. Maybe there's an obstacle behind the boulder.

Alternatively, maybe the agent should move south to (39,16) and then try pushing the boulder west or north. But the bars adjacent north and northwest might block that.

Another possibility is that the agent should reposition to a different spot to get a clear path. For example, moving east to (40,15) and then trying to navigate around the bars to get to the boulder. However, moving east from (39,15) is allowed if there's no obstacle. The language observation says bars adjacent north and northwest, but east is not mentioned as blocked. So maybe moving east is possible.

Wait, in the latest observation, after moving south, the agent is back at (39,15). The message says ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" Which suggests that the agent was trying to push the boulder but couldn't because it's blocked. So the boulder must be against another obstacle or the agent isn't positioned correctly.

Given that the boulder is adjacent southwest, the agent is at (39,15). To push it southwest (which would be towards the fountain west), the agent needs to be to the east of the boulder. So move west to (38,15), then push the boulder west to (38,14), which is towards the fountain at (39,14) (assuming the fountain is west adjacent). But the agent's current position after moving west is (38,15), and the boulder is at (38,16). So from (38,15), the agent would need to move south to (38,16) to be adjacent to the boulder, then push it west to (38,15), but that's where the agent is. Maybe that's not the right direction.

Alternatively, if the boulder is at (38,16), and the agent is at (38,15), they can push the boulder south to (38,17), but that's away from the fountain. The fountain is adjacent southeast and west. The fountain west would be at (38,14), perhaps.

This is getting a bit confusing. Let's recap:

- Agent is at (39,15).
- Boulder is adjacent southwest, so likely at (38,16).
- Fountain is adjacent west and southeast. So the west fountain would be at (38,15), and southeast at (40,16).

To push the boulder onto the west fountain at (38,15), the agent needs to move the boulder there. The boulder is at (38,16). So the agent needs to push it north to (38,15). To do that, the agent must be to the south of the boulder. So the agent needs to move to (38,16), which is the boulder's current position, but that's occupied. So instead, the agent should move west to (38,15) and then push the boulder north to (38,14), but that's not the fountain. Wait, the fountain is adjacent west, which would be (39,14). Hmm.

Wait, the language observation says ""fountain adjacent south and west"". So the agent's current position (39,15) has a fountain adjacent south (at 39,16) and west (at 38,15). So the west fountain is at (38,15), and south fountain at (39,16).

The boulder is at (38,16), adjacent southwest to the agent. To push the boulder onto the west fountain at (38,15), the agent needs to move the boulder north to (38,15). To do that, the agent must be to the south of the boulder (at 38,16) and push north. So the agent needs to move to (38,16), but that's where the boulder is. So instead, the agent can move west to (38,15), then push the boulder north to (38,14), which is not the fountain. Alternatively, push the boulder west to (37,16), but that's away from the fountain.

Alternatively, maybe the agent should move east to (40,15), then find a way to position themselves to push the boulder towards the southeast fountain at (40,16). But the bars are adjacent north and northwest, so moving north is blocked. Maybe moving east and then south?

This is tricky. Given the previous attempts to push west resulted in failure, perhaps the agent needs to try a different direction. Since the boulder is to the southwest, maybe moving south to (39,16) and then trying to push the boulder west or north. But from (39,16), pushing west would aim for the fountain at (38,16), but the boulder is already there. Alternatively, pushing north is blocked by bars.

Alternatively, maybe the agent should move west to (38,15) and then push the boulder north to (38,14), which is towards the west fountain at (38,15). But that's one step away. So pushing the boulder from (38,16) north to (38,15) would place it on the west fountain. To do that, the agent must be to the south of the boulder, so they need to move to (38,16) and push north. But the agent can't move into the boulder; they have to push it by moving into it from the opposite direction.

Wait, in Boxoban, you push a boulder by moving into it from the side, which moves the boulder in the direction you moved. So if the agent is at (38,15) (west of the boulder at (38,16)), and moves south into the boulder, that would push the boulder north to (38,15), which is the west fountain. That seems possible.

So the steps would be:

1. Move west from (39,15) to (38,15).
2. Move south from (38,15) into the boulder at (38,16), pushing it north to (38,15), which is the fountain.

But in the previous attempts, moving west didn't result in being able to push. Maybe there was an obstacle preventing that. However, according to the latest observation, after moving south, the agent is back at (39,15), and the boulder is adjacent southwest. So the agent is at (39,15), boulder at (38,16).

To execute the push:

- Agent moves west to (38,15).
- Then moves south to (38,16), which is the boulder's position, pushing it north to (38,15), the fountain.

But when the agent tried moving west before, they might have been blocked or the boulder was stuck. Let's check the map again. The map shows at position (38,16) a `.` which is an empty floor, and the boulder is marked as `{` at (38,16). Wait, no—the map shows:

In the map section for y=15, the agent is at (38,15) with `@`, and the next line (y=16) has the boulder `{` at position (38,16). So the agent needs to move south to (38,16) to be adjacent to the boulder, then push it north to (38,15), which is the fountain.

So the correct action sequence would be:

1. west to (38,15)
2. south to (38,16) (pushing the boulder north to (38,15))

But in the previous steps, when the agent tried moving west, they ended up at (38,15) but couldn't push. Maybe because the boulder was already north of the fountain and couldn't be moved further.

Wait, the fountain is at (38,15). If the boulder is at (38,16), pushing it north to (38,15) would place it on the fountain. That's the goal.

So the agent needs to move to (38,15) and then push the boulder north. The action would be ""push north"" when at (38,15).

But the possible actions are north, east, south, west, and push direction. So the correct action is ""push north"" when the agent is at (38,15), which is west of the boulder.

Therefore, the agent should first move west to (38,15), then push north.

",-0.001,False
60,west,"<reasoning>
Let's try to figure out what to do here. The agent is stuck trying to move a boulder, but it's not working. The map shows a bunch of bars blocking the way north, northnortheast, westnorthwest, and northnorthwest. The player is at position (39,15), and there's a boulder near westnorthwest. The goal is to push the boulder onto the fountain, which is southeast of the current position.

First, looking at the map, the agent's current position is at (39,15). The fountain is near eastsoutheast, which would be to the southeast. But there are a lot of bars blocking the direct path. The boulder is adjacent to southwest, so maybe it's to the southwest of the agent's current position. 

The agent tried pushing west before, but the boulder wasn't there. Wait, the latest observation says the boulder is adjacent to southwest. So if the agent is at (39,15), southwest would be (38,14). But the agent's y-coordinate is 15, so moving south would take them to y=16. The boulder is adjacent to southwest, meaning it's either to the south or west. 

The agent needs to get to the boulder and push it towards the fountain. The fountain is in the southeast, so the best path for the boulder is probably south or east. But with all the bars, movement is restricted. The agent tried moving west multiple times but ended up back at (40,15) or similar. The bars are blocking north, so moving north isn't possible. 

The latest message says ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" That suggests the agent tried pushing it in a direction but there's an obstacle behind. Since the boulder is adjacent to southwest, maybe the agent needs to move west to get next to it. Wait, but earlier steps showed that moving west got the agent to (39,15), and then trying to push west again didn't work. Maybe the boulder is not in that direction. 

Looking at the cursor position after moving west to (39,15), the boulder is still near westnorthwest. Westnorthwest from (39,15) would be (38,14). So the agent needs to get to (38,14) to push the boulder. To get there, the agent needs to move west again, but there's a dark area nearby. Maybe there's a path through the dark area. 

Alternatively, since the agent is at (39,15) and the boulder is at (38,14), moving west once more would get to (38,15). From there, moving south to (38,16) might allow pushing the boulder southwest towards the fountain. But the map shows a dark area very near southeast, south, and southwest. So moving south might lead into a dark area, which could be a problem. 

Another option is to check if there's a clear path to the boulder. The agent could move west to (38,15), then check if the path to the boulder (southwest to (38,14)) is clear. If there are no obstacles, the agent can push the boulder southwest. But the current observations don't show any clear path in that direction; the bars are very near north, northeast, etc. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent should try pushing the boulder in a different direction. If the boulder is at (38,14), pushing it east would move it to (39,14), which is adjacent to the agent's current position. Then the agent could move south to push it further towards the southeast fountain. 

But the agent needs to get next to the boulder first. Since the agent is at (39,15), moving west to (38,15), then south to (38,16), then west to (38,15) again? Not sure. Or maybe move south first to (39,16), then west. 

Wait, the latest map shows the agent's position at (39,15) with the boulder adjacent to southwest. So the boulder is to the southwest, which from (39,15) is either (38,15) south or (39,14) west. But adjacent southwest would be one square diagonally southwest, which is (38,14). So the boulder is at (38,14). 

To get there, the agent needs to move southwest. But movement is only allowed in four directions. So the agent can move west to (38,15), then south to (38,14), positioning next to the boulder. Then push it south or east. 

But moving west to (38,15) is possible if there's no obstacle. The language observation mentions bars very near north, northeast, etc., but not specifically blocking (38,15). So maybe it's a safe move. 

Once next to the boulder at (38,14), the agent can push it south to (38,13) or east to (39,14). Pushing east towards the fountain's direction might be better. 

So the plan is: move west to (38,15), then south to (38,14), then push east. But need to check if those moves are possible. 

However, the agent has been trying to push west but getting errors. Maybe the boulder isn't there anymore or there's an obstacle. Alternatively, the agent needs to reposition properly. 

Another possibility is that the boulder is already in a position where pushing it south would place it on the fountain. If the fountain is at (40,16), for example, pushing the boulder from (38,14) south to (38,13) won't reach it. Maybe the fountain is at a different location. 

Looking at the cursor position and the map, the fountain is very near eastsoutheast. So maybe (41,16) or similar. To get the boulder there, the agent needs to push it east multiple times. But with bars blocking the north, the agent might need to find a path around. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent should move east to get closer to the fountain. But the boulder is west of the agent. 

This is getting complicated. Let's summarize the possible steps:

1. Move west to (38,15) to get closer to the boulder.
2. Move south to (38,14) to be adjacent to the boulder.
3. Push the boulder east towards the fountain.

But need to ensure that those moves are possible and that there are no obstacles. The bars are blocking north, but south and east might be clear. 

The agent's previous attempts to push west resulted in failure, possibly because the boulder wasn't in the right position or there was an obstacle behind. 

Given the current position and the boulder's location, the best action seems to be moving west to (38,15) to reposition. Then south to (38,14), then push east. But the agent needs to check if those moves are allowed. 

Alternatively, since the agent is at (39,15) and the boulder is at (38,14), moving southwest isn't possible, so the agent must move west then south. 

So the next action should be west to (38,15). Then, once there, check again and proceed.

",-0.001,False
61,push east,"<reasoning>
The agent is stuck trying to push a boulder that's blocked by bars. Let's look at the current observation.

The player is at position (38, 15). The map shows several bars around, which are obstacles that can't be moved through. The boulder is adjacent to the southwest and south. The fountain is to the southeast, which is the goal. The player's inventory has a long sword and other items, but nothing that would help here.

The previous attempts to push the boulder with ""push west"" didn't work because the boulder is blocked by maybe another obstacle or the bars themselves. The message after pushing west said ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain,"" indicating there's something blocking the boulder's path.

Looking at the map, the boulder is adjacent to the southwest and south. The player is trying to move west but the boulder is there. Maybe the boulder needs to be pushed in a direction where there's no obstacle. Since the boulder is south and southwest of the player, maybe pushing it south into the fountain would solve it. However, the fountain is already adjacent to the southeast, which might be a different fountain. Wait, the language observation mentions a fountain very near eastsoutheast, which is probably the target. The player needs to push the boulder to the eastsoutheast fountain.

But the current position of the boulder is southwest and south of the player. If the player moves south and then tries to push the boulder east towards the fountain? Let's see. The player is at (38,15). Moving south to (38,16), then maybe east to position (39,16), and push the boulder east towards the fountain.

But the player's last move was west, ending up at (38,15). The boulder is adjacent to the southwest (which would be (37,15)) and south (38,16). So pushing the boulder south from (38,15) would be to (38,16), but there's a dark area there. Maybe the boulder can't be pushed into darkness. Alternatively, pushing the boulder southwest towards (37,14), but that's blocked by bars. 

Alternatively, the player might need to reposition themselves to be adjacent to the boulder in a direction where it can be pushed towards the fountain. Since the fountain is eastsoutheast, maybe pushing the boulder east. But the boulder is currently southwest and south. The player is west of the boulder. So the player needs to move east to be next to the boulder. Let's check the current position. The player is at (38,15), and the boulder is adjacent southwest (37,15) and south (38,16). So if the player moves east to (39,15), they can then try to push the boulder south or east.

Looking at the map, moving east from (38,15) to (39,15) is possible if there's no obstacle. The map shows at (39,15) as part of the path with a '@' symbol, so that's the player's position. Wait, no—the map shows the player's position as (38,15) with '@' and the cursor is there. The boulder is at (39,15) adjacent south and southwest? Wait, maybe the boulder is at (39,15), so the player is trying to push it west, but the bars are blocking.

Alternatively, maybe the boulder is at (38,16) south of the player. If the player moves south to (38,16), they can try to push the boulder east towards the fountain. But the southern area has dark areas, so pushing into darkness might not be allowed. The goal is to push the boulder onto the fountain, which is in the eastsoutheast direction. So maybe the correct approach is to move the player closer to the boulder in a direction that allows pushing it towards the fountain.

Given the previous attempts to push west resulted in failure, perhaps moving south and then pushing east would work. Let's see:

1. Move south from (38,15) to (38,16).
2. Then push east towards the fountain.

But the boulder is at (38,15)'s south, which is (38,16). If the player is at (38,16) and the boulder is at (38,16), that can't be. Wait, the boulder is adjacent south of the player, meaning the boulder is at (38,16). So the player needs to push it east into the fountain. But the fountain is at eastsoutheast, which is (39,17) perhaps? Not sure about the map coordinates, but the language observation says fountain very near eastsoutheast.

If the boulder is at (38,16), pushing it east would move it to (39,16). Then from there, pushing further east to reach the fountain. But the current map shows that at (39,16) there's a `<` symbol, which might be a door or another obstacle. Alternatively, maybe the fountain is at (39,17).

Alternatively, maybe the player needs to find a path around the bars to get to a position where the boulder can be pushed towards the fountain. The bars are very near north, northeast, etc., so moving around them is difficult.

Another idea: The stairs up are near westsouthwest, so maybe the solution is to go upstairs, but the goal is to push the boulder, not escape. So focusing on that.

The player's inventory has a shield and armor, but no keys or tools to remove obstacles. So the only way is to find a path to push the boulder through available spaces towards the fountain.

Given the boulder is at (38,16) south of the player, moving the player to (38,16) and then pushing east might be possible if there's no obstacle. But the map shows at (39,16) there's a `<` which could be a door or a passage. If it's a door, maybe it's closed, but the player can push the boulder through if it's open or kick it open. However, the agent doesn't have that information.

Alternatively, maybe the boulder can be pushed north towards the bars, but that's not helpful. The goal is to get it to the fountain.

Another approach: The player is at (38,15). The boulder is at (38,16) south. If the player moves south to (38,16), then tries to push the boulder east. If the space east of the boulder (39,16) is accessible, then that's the way to go. The observation mentions a fountain adjacent southeast, which could be at (39,17). So pushing the boulder east twice: first to (39,16), then to (40,16), and finally to (40,17) where the fountain is.

But the current map shows at (39,16) a `<` which might block the path. If that's a door, the player might need to open it first, but they don't have a key. Alternatively, maybe the `<` is a staircase down, but the player is on the first level.

Given the lack of tools to manipulate doors or keys, the best bet is to push the boulder towards the fountain through open paths. Since the player is at (38,15), moving south to (38,16) and then pushing east twice.

So the sequence would be:

1. south
2. push east

But need to check if the path is clear. The observation says that after moving south, the boulder is at (38,16), and pushing east would move it to (39,16). The language observation mentions ""fountain adjacent southeast"", which might be at (39,17). So pushing the boulder from (38,16) east to (39,16), then east again to (40,16), then north or east to reach the fountain.

Alternatively, maybe the boulder can be pushed directly east from its current position (38,16) to (39,16), which is adjacent to the fountain. If the fountain is at (39,17), then moving the boulder to (39,16) would be one step closer.

But the player needs to be adjacent to the boulder to push it. So after moving south to (38,16), they can push east.

However, previous attempts to push west resulted in failure because the boulder was blocked by bars. Maybe pushing east is possible if the path is clear.

Given the current observation, the best action is to move south to get next to the boulder and then push east towards the fountain.

I need to solve this Boxoban level. The goal is to push all the boulders onto the fountains. Let me look at the current situation.

Looking at the map, the player is at position (38, 15). There's a boulder near the westnorthwest direction. The fountains are near eastsoutheast. The bars are blocking a lot of paths, especially to the north. The agent tried pushing west before but couldn't due to the boulder or bars. 

The latest observation shows that after moving west to (38, 15), there's a boulder adjacent to the southwest. The message says ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" So maybe the boulder is blocked by something else. 

I need to check the map again. The map shows some structures with bars and dark areas. The player is next to a boulder at (38, 15), perhaps to the southwest. The fountain is at eastsoutheast, which is probably to the east and south. 

Since pushing west isn't working, maybe try moving east to get closer to the boulder. Wait, the cursor is at (38, 15), and the boulder is adjacent southwest. So moving south might allow accessing that boulder. Alternatively, moving east could get past some bars.

But the bars adjacent north and northwest are making it hard to go north. Maybe the best approach is to go around the bars by moving south or east. Let's check the language observations again. The bars very near include north, northeast, etc., so moving north is blocked. 

If I move south, perhaps I can find a path to the boulder. The fountain is south and west, so maybe pushing the boulder towards there. Let me see the cursor position: (38,15). If I move south to (38,16), maybe there's a path. The map shows some '.' and '#' which could be floor and walls. 

Alternatively, moving east to (39,15) might open up a path. There's a boulder very near east and westsouthwest. Wait, there's a boulder at westnorthwest, which is near the current position. Maybe the agent needs to push that boulder south or east. 

But the boulder is adjacent southwest, so moving south might allow pushing it further. Let's try pushing the boulder south. The action would be ""push south"". But the previous attempts to push west resulted in errors, likely because the boulder is blocked. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to move around to a different direction. If the bars are blocking north, perhaps moving east to find a way around. The stairs up are near westsouthwest, but the goal is fountains, not stairs. 

Another idea: check if the boulder can be pushed east towards the fountain. If the agent moves east and then pushes the boulder east, that might work. Let's see. The cursor is at (38,15). Moving east to (39,15), then pushing east towards the fountain. But need to make sure there's no obstacle behind the boulder. 

Looking at the map, at (38,15) southwest is the boulder. So moving south to (38,16) and then pushing the boulder south or east. 

Wait, the latest observation says ""boulder adjacent southwest"". So the boulder is to the southwest of the agent's current position. That would be at (37,14) or similar. To push it, the agent needs to be adjacent and push in a direction. 

But the agent is at (38,15). To push the boulder southwest, the agent would need to be to the northwest of the boulder. Maybe the agent should move west then south. But moving west got stuck before. 

Alternatively, move south to (38,16), then west to (37,16), then push the boulder south or west. However, the bars and dark areas might block that path. 

This is a bit confusing. The key is to get the boulder onto the fountain. The fountain is at eastsoutheast, so pushing the boulder east or southeast would be ideal. 

Given the obstacles, maybe the best move is to move east to (39,15) and then try pushing the boulder east. But need to check if there's a clear path. 

Alternatively, since the agent is stuck trying to push west, maybe try a different direction. Move south to (38,16) and see if there's a path. The map shows some open areas with '.' which might be walkable. 

Another possibility: the boulder at westnorthwest (near (37,14)) can be pushed east towards the fountain. To do that, the agent needs to move to the northwest of the boulder, which is (38,14), then push east. But moving to (38,14) might be blocked by bars or dark areas. 

Looking at the map, the area at (38,14) is probably a wall or bar. The map shows ""##########"" which are walls. So that's blocked. 

Hmm, maybe the agent needs to go around the bars to the east. Moving east from (38,15) to (39,15), then south to (39,16), and then look for a way to push the boulder. 

But the latest observation after moving east to (39,15) shows the same boulders and fountains. The agent is stuck in a loop trying to push west but can't. 

Perhaps the solution is to move south, then east, then push the boulder east. Let's try that. Move south to (38,16), then east to (39,16), then check if the boulder can be pushed east. 

Alternatively, since the fountain is at eastsoutheast, maybe pushing the boulder southeast. But the agent needs to be in the right position. 

This is tricky. The main issue is the bars blocking movement north and the boulder's position. The agent needs to find a way to maneuver the boulder around the obstacles. 

Given the previous attempts failed, maybe the best action is to move south to see if there's a clear path. The action would be ""south"".

Let me try to figure out what the agent should do here. The environment is Boxoban, a Sokoban-like game where the goal is to push boulders onto fountains. The agent is a knight who can push boulders by walking into them, provided there's nothing blocking their path behind.

Looking at the current observation, the agent is at position (38, 15). The map shows walls (bars) all around the northern part, which the agent can't pass through. There's a boulder (""boulder very near east and westnorthwest"") and a fountain near eastsoutheast. The agent's inventory includes a sword, lance, ring mail, helmet, shield, gloves, and some food, but no key or other items that might be relevant here.

The agent tried pushing west and encountered the boulder, which didn't move because there's likely an obstacle behind it. The message ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" indicates that the boulder can't be moved in the last attempted direction (probably west). Now, the agent is at (38, 15) again after moving west and then back.

The immediate goal is to get the boulder onto the fountain. The fountain is at eastsoutheast, which is south-east relative to the agent's current position. The boulder near east might be closer to the fountain, but there's a dark area and bars blocking direct paths. The agent needs to navigate around the obstacles to position the boulder.

Looking at the map structure, there's a stairs up near westsouthwest, but the agent's focus should be on the boulders and fountains. The bars are solid walls, so the agent can't go through them. The dark areas might be out of bounds or hidden pathways, but it's safer to assume they're obstacles unless specified otherwise.

The agent's last successful move was moving west to (38, 15). Now, trying to push the boulder east might be possible if there's space behind it. Alternatively, moving south could allow the agent to approach the boulder from a different angle. However, the message when trying to push west indicates that the boulder can't be moved there, so maybe the path behind it is blocked by a wall or another boulder.

Alternatively, moving south might lead the agent into a position where they can push the boulder east towards the fountain. Let's check the surrounding terrain:

- To the north: bars, so no movement possible.
- To the east: a boulder and a fountain. If the agent can push the boulder east, it might reach the fountain.
- To the south: there's a boulder adjacent to the southwest and southeast. If the agent moves south, they might be able to navigate around these obstacles.

Wait, the current cursor position is (38, 15). Moving south would take the agent to (38, 16). Looking at the map, at (38, 16), there's a `<` which might be the fountain adjacent to the west. But the boulder is at westnorthwest, which is probably at (37, 15) or nearby. The agent needs to get that boulder to the fountain.

Another approach: the boulder near east (at (39, 15)) is adjacent to the southeast and south. If the agent can move east to that boulder and then push it south or southeast towards the fountain. But the agent is currently at (38, 15), so moving east once gets to (39, 15), which is where the boulder is. Then, attempting to push the boulder east might work if the path behind it is clear. However, the observation says ""boulder adjacent southeast and south,"" so pushing east might be possible if there's space behind.

Alternatively, the agent could move south to (38, 16) and then try to push the boulder from there. But the message when pushing west failed because the boulder couldn't move, perhaps due to a wall behind it. So, the agent needs to find another way to reposition the boulder.

Given the current position, the agent's best bet might be to move east to the boulder at (39, 15) and then try pushing it east towards the fountain. However, the previous attempt to push west failed, so maybe the agent needs to try a different direction. Let's see:

If the agent moves east to (39, 15), which is where the boulder is, then tries to push east, the boulder would move to (40, 15). If that space is free (not blocked by bars or other boulders), then it could reach the fountain. Checking the map, at (40, 15), there's a `#` which is a wall (bars), so pushing the boulder east won't work. Therefore, the agent needs to find another path.

Alternatively, moving south to (38, 16) and then trying to push the boulder south or east. At (38, 16), the agent might have a better view of the obstacles. The fountain is at eastsoutheast, which would be further south-east. Maybe moving the boulder south first and then east.

But the agent's previous attempts to push west and north resulted in failures due to bars. The key is to find a clear path for the boulder to the fountain. Given the current layout, perhaps the agent needs to move the boulder at (39, 15) southeast towards the fountain. To do that, the agent could move east to be next to the boulder, then push it southeast. However, looking at the map, the southeast direction from (39, 15) would be (39, 16), which is a dark area. If that's passable, then pushing the boulder there might work. But dark areas might be out of bounds, so it's risky.

Another possibility is that the boulder near westnorthwest (probably at (37, 15)) can be moved north or east. The agent is currently at (38, 15), which is adjacent to that boulder to the east. If the agent moves west to (37, 15) and tries to push the boulder west, but west is blocked by bars. So pushing west isn't possible. Pushing north might be possible if the path is clear. From (37, 15), pushing north would go to (37, 14), which is a bar, so that's blocked. Therefore, that boulder can't be moved either.

This suggests that the agent is stuck trying to move the boulders because their paths are blocked by walls or other boulders. The only movable boulder might be the one at (39, 15), but pushing it east is blocked by a wall. The other boulder at (37, 15) is also stuck.

Given this, the agent might need to reposition itself to find a different path. Moving south to (38, 16) and then trying to navigate around the obstacles. From (38, 16), moving east to (39, 16) which is a dark area—perhaps that's passable? If so, the agent could move into (39, 16) and then try to push the boulder from there. However, the dark area might mean it's a different room or blocked, so the agent should avoid it unless necessary.

Alternatively, the agent could move north, but that's blocked by bars. The only viable movement seems to be south or east. But east is blocked by the boulder and a potential wall. South might lead to a better position.

Wait, the agent is at (38, 15). Moving south to (38, 16), which is marked as `<` in the map. Looking at the map provided:

At row 8 (assuming the map starts from the bottom?), the agent's position is at (38, 15). The map lines are a bit unclear, but the `<` is likely the fountain. The fountain adjacent south and west would be at (38, 15) south and west. So moving south to (38, 16) gets the agent next to the fountain. If the boulder can be moved here, that would solve the problem.

But the boulder at (39, 15) is east of the agent. If the agent moves east to (39, 15) and then pushes the boulder south to (39, 16), which is adjacent to the fountain at (38, 16), that could work. However, the path from (39, 15) south to (39, 16) must be clear. The observation mentions ""bars very near north..."" but doesn't specify the south direction here. If (39, 16) is a dark area, it's possibly blocked.

Given the uncertainty, the safest bet might be to move south to (38, 16) and then try to push the boulder from there. Alternatively, move east to the boulder and attempt a different push direction.

After considering all options, the best action seems to be moving south to (38, 16) to get a better view and possibly push the boulder towards the fountain from there.

64,push east,"<reasoning>
Let's try to figure out what to do next. The agent is stuck trying to push a boulder but it's not working. The previous attempts to move west, north, south, and push directions didn't work because of bars or the boulder not being in the right position.

Looking at the map, the agent is at (38,15). The boulders are either near westnorthwest or east. The goal is to push the boulder onto the fountain, which is near eastsoutheast. The stairs are up at westsouthwest, but maybe that's not relevant right now.

The last message said ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" So the agent is trying to push a boulder but there's an obstacle. The bars are blocking the way north. Maybe the boulder is adjacent to a bar, making it impossible to push further.

Looking at the cursor position and the map, the agent is next to a boulder at (38,15). The boulder adjacent southwest might be the one. To push it southwest, the agent needs to be facing the right direction. The agent is facing south based on the map's '@' position. If the boulder is southwest of the agent, pushing it would require moving the agent west or south. But the bars are north, so moving north is blocked. 

Alternatively, maybe the boulder is to the east. The agent tried pushing east before, but failed. Perhaps the boulder is blocked by another obstacle. The dark areas and bars might be creating a barrier.

Another approach: maybe the agent should move around the boulder to get a better position to push it. Since the agent is at (38,15), moving west to (37,15) might allow pushing the boulder southwest. Or moving south to (38,16) if possible. But the map shows that moving south might hit a bar or dark area.

Check the language observations again. The boulder adjacent southwest. So the boulder is southwest of the agent. To push it southwest, the agent needs to be facing southwest and then push. But the agent's current position is (38,15), and the boulder is southwest, so perhaps at (37,14). To push it there, the agent needs to be adjacent and push in the direction of the boulder. 

Wait, the agent's current position is (38,15). The boulder adjacent southwest would be at (37,14). To push it southwest, the agent needs to move into (37,14) and push it further. But the bars are north, so maybe the path is blocked. Alternatively, the agent should move west to (37,15) and then push south into (37,14), which is the boulder's position. But the problem is that the agent tried pushing east and west before, but the boulder wasn't moving. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to check if there's a clear path behind the boulder. If the boulder is against a wall or another obstacle, pushing it won't work. The bars are all around, so maybe the boulder is stuck between bars. 

Given that the agent is stuck, perhaps the best move is to try a different direction. Maybe move south to (38,16) and see if there's a path. But the language observations mention bars very near south, so moving south might hit a bar. 

Alternatively, look for the fountain at eastsoutheast. The agent is west of it. Maybe moving east towards the fountain, but there's a boulder in the way. The boulder near east is at (39,15), adjacent to the agent's current position. To push that boulder east into the fountain, the agent needs to be facing east and have a clear path. But the bars are north, so moving east might be possible if the path is clear. 

The agent tried pushing east before, but the message said it failed. Maybe the boulder is blocked by another boulder or an obstacle. Looking at the language observations, the boulder very near east and westsouthwest. The one near east is at (39,15), adjacent to the agent. To push it east into the fountain (eastsoutheast), the agent needs to be at (39,15) and push east. But the agent is currently at (38,15). So moving east to (39,15) and then pushing east. 

Wait, the agent is already next to the boulder. The message says ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" So when the agent tried to push east, the boulder didn't move. That could mean there's something blocking the path east of the boulder. The fountain is eastsoutheast, which is further east. So maybe there's a bar or dark area blocking the path beyond the boulder. 

In that case, the agent needs to first move the boulder past the blocking obstacle. But if the path is blocked by bars, pushing the boulder further east isn't possible. So maybe the agent should try to move the boulder in another direction. For example, if the boulder is at (39,15), pushing it south into (39,16) if that's possible. 

Checking the map, the agent's current position is (38,15) with '@', and the boulder is at (39,15) marked as '{@'. The cursor is at (38,15). To push the boulder east, the agent needs to be adjacent and push. The problem is that east of (39,15) is probably a bar or another obstacle. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent should move south to (38,16) and then try to push the boulder from a different angle. But looking at the language observations, bars are adjacent north and northwest. So moving south might not be blocked. 

Another idea: check if the boulder can be pushed west. The boulder at (39,15) is east of the agent. Pushing west would move it to (38,15), but the agent is already there. So that's not possible. 

Alternatively, the agent should look for another boulder. The language observations mention a boulder very near westsouthwest. Maybe that's the other one. If the agent can move to that boulder and push it towards the fountain, that could work. 

The agent is at (38,15). The westsouthwest boulder would be somewhere like (37,14) or similar. To get there, the agent needs to move west and south. But the bars are north and northwest, so moving west is possible, but moving south might hit a bar. 

Alternatively, the agent could try to move north around the bars, but the message says they can't pass through the bars. So north is blocked. 

Given all this, the most logical step is to try pushing the eastern boulder again, but in a different direction. Maybe the agent needs to check if there's a clear path east of the boulder. If there's a bar there, pushing won't work. But if the path is clear, then pushing east into the fountain would be the solution. 

Since the agent keeps getting ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain,"" maybe the path is blocked. So perhaps the agent should instead move to the other boulder in westsouthwest and try to push that towards the fountain. 

To reach the westsouthwest boulder, the agent would need to move west to (37,15), then south to (37,14), which is the boulder's position. From there, pushing it south or east towards the fountain. 

But the agent's current position is (38,15). Moving west to (37,15), then south to (37,14) (the boulder), then push southwest or southeast. 

However, the agent's previous attempts to move west resulted in being next to the boulder but still unable to push. Maybe the agent needs to position themselves correctly. 

Alternatively, the agent could try to move the boulder in a direction that avoids the bars. For example, pushing the western boulder south into an open area. 

Given the limited information and the fact that the agent is stuck, the next best action is to try a different direction. Since pushing east didn't work, maybe pushing south towards the fountain's direction. 

Wait, the fountain is eastsoutheast, so south-east. The agent is at (38,15). To move towards the fountain, the agent could go east and south. But there's a boulder east. 

Alternatively, the agent could move south to (38,16) and then east to (39,16), but the bars are in the way. 

In conclusion, the agent should continue trying to push the eastern boulder east, but if that's blocked, then move to the other boulder and try pushing that towards the fountain. However, based on the current position and observations, the best immediate action is to try pushing the eastern boulder east again, perhaps in a different sequence of moves.

",-0.001,False
65,west,"<reasoning>
Let's see where I am in this Boxoban game. The goal is to push the boulders onto the fountains. From the observations, there's a boulder near westnorthwest and another adjacent to southwest. The fountain is adjacent to northwest.

Looking at the map, the agent is at (38, 15). The boulder adjacent to southwest is probably south of the agent's current position. The fountain is to the east, so maybe pushing a boulder towards there would help. 

Earlier attempts to move north hit bars, so that's blocked. The agent tried moving west, east, and south, but the boulders aren't moving because they might be blocked by walls or other obstacles. The message says ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain,"" which means the boulder can't be pushed because there's something behind it.

I need to check if there's a way to reposition the agent to push the boulder in the right direction. Maybe moving east to get closer to the boulder near westnorthwest? Or west to get next to the boulder adjacent to southwest. 

Wait, the boulder adjacent to southwest is at (38, 16) perhaps? If the agent moves south to (38, 16), they might be able to push the boulder west or east. But the message says moving the boulder fails, so maybe the path behind it is blocked. 

Another idea: the fountain is adjacent to northwest. If the agent can push a boulder from the westnorthwest towards the northwest fountain, that would solve it. But the current position of the agent is west of that boulder. Maybe moving west again to get next to it, then pushing east? But the agent was already at (38,15) and moving west got to (37,15), but the boulder is at westnorthwest, which might be further west.

Alternatively, check if the stairs up near westsouthwest are relevant. Maybe going upstairs changes the level, but the goal is on this level. Probably not necessary right now.

The key is to find a boulder that can be pushed towards a fountain. The boulder very near westnorthwest is at (39,14) maybe? If the agent can get to the west of that boulder and push it east towards the fountain at (39,14) east would be (40,14), which is a fountain. But the agent's current position is (38,15). To reach the westnorthwest boulder, the agent needs to move west to (37,15) and then maybe north or south. 

Looking at the map, there's a `#<..``{.{#` on line 9, which might represent the boulders and fountains. The `<` is the agent, and `{` is a fountain. The boulder is nearby. If the agent moves west to (37,15), then checks north or south, maybe they can find a path to push the boulder. 

Alternatively, the boulder adjacent to southwest is at (38,16). If the agent moves south to (38,16), they might be able to push the boulder west or east. But the message said pushing failed before, so perhaps the path is blocked. 

I need to try a different direction. Maybe move north again, but the bars are blocking. So the only options are west, east, south, or pushing in those directions. 

Since pushing didn't work before, perhaps the agent needs to maneuver around to get a clear path. For example, move west to get next to the boulder, then push east towards the fountain. Let's try that. Moving west to (37,15), then push east. If that's possible, the boulder would move to (38,15), which is adjacent to the fountain at (39,15)? Wait, the fountain is adjacent to northwest, which might be at (38,14) or similar. 

This is getting a bit confusing. Let me recap the positions:

- Agent: (38,15)
- Boulder westnorthwest: possibly (39,14)
- Fountain northwest: maybe (37,14) or (38,14)
- Another boulder adjacent southwest: maybe (38,16)

If the agent moves west to (37,15), then checks north or south. If north is blocked by bars, maybe south to (37,16). Then, if there's a boulder at (39,14), the agent would need to be west of it to push east. But the agent is at (37,15), which is not adjacent. 

Alternatively, the boulder near east is at (39,15) maybe. If the agent moves east to (39,15), they can try pushing west. But the fountain is to the east of the agent's current position. 

Wait, the fountain adjacent southeast is at (39,16) perhaps. So if a boulder is pushed to (39,16), that would cover the fountain. 

But how to get the boulder there. The boulder very near east and westsouthwest is at (39,15) maybe. If the agent moves east to (39,15) and pushes west towards (38,15), which is where the agent is, that's not helpful. 

Alternatively, the boulder at westnorthwest (39,14) can be pushed east to (40,14), which might be a space towards the fountain. But the agent needs to be adjacent to it. 

This is tricky. Maybe the best move is to keep trying to push the boulder in some direction, even if it's failing, but the game might have a different blockage. Alternatively, move to a different spot to access the boulder. 

Since the agent is at (38,15), moving west to (37,15) and then north or south might reveal a path. Let's try west again.

I need to figure out what action to take next in this Boxoban game. Let me start by looking at the current observation and what's going on.

First, the agent is at position (37, 15). The map shows some bars and dark areas, and there's a boulder near eastnorthwest. The main goal is to push the boulders onto the fountains. From the previous messages, trying to move the boulder resulted in failure, so maybe the boulder isn't in the right position yet. 

Looking at the language observations, there's a fountain very near east, and a boulder very near eastsoutheast. So the boulder is close to the eastsoutheast fountain. Maybe the agent needs to position itself to push the boulder towards that fountain.

The cursor is at (37, 15), which is west of where it was before. The last few actions were moving west, then east, and trying to push, but the bars are blocking the way. The current message doesn't show any error, so maybe the agent is now in a position where it can push the boulder.

The agent's inventory has a long sword and a lance, but pushing a boulder doesn't require attacking. The key is to move towards the boulder and push it in the right direction. The boulder is at eastnorthwest, which from the map might be to the east of the agent's current position. 

Wait, in the map, the agent's position is marked with @, and the boulder is shown with {. The map line for y=15 has #..@.{..`#, so the agent is at position x=37, y=15 (since the @ is the fourth character from the left in that line). The boulder { is at x=39, y=15. So the boulder is two units east of the agent. 

To push the boulder east, the agent needs to move east into the boulder. But the language observation says there's a boulder adjacent southeast and northwest. Wait, the adjacent boulders are southeast and northwest of the agent. So the agent is surrounded by boulders on those sides? That might mean there's a boulder to the southeast (south-east) and northwest (north-west). 

But according to the map, the boulder is to the east (since the @ is at x=37, and the { is at x=39). So maybe the agent needs to move east to get next to the boulder and then push it further east towards the fountain. However, the previous attempts to push resulted in failure, possibly because there's an obstacle behind the boulder. 

Looking at the language observations, there are bars very near north, northeast, etc. The bars might be walls or obstacles that are blocking the path after pushing. The agent needs to ensure that when pushing the boulder east, there's nothing behind it. 

The fountain is very near east, which is probably in the direction of the boulder. So the correct action would be to push the boulder east towards the fountain. But how to do that when the agent is at (37,15) and the boulder is at (39,15). To push the boulder east, the agent needs to move east into the boulder's tile, which requires that the tile east of the boulder (x=40, y=15) is free. 

Checking the map, the line for y=15 is #..@.{..`#. The characters after the { are ..`#, so the tile east of the boulder (x=40) is a '.' which is a floor, so it's free. Therefore, the agent can move east to (38,15), then again to (39,15) to be next to the boulder, and then push it east to (40,15). 

But the previous actions were trying to push directly, which might not be working because the agent wasn't in the correct position. So the correct sequence would be to move east twice to get next to the boulder, then push east. However, the agent needs to avoid moving into bars or dark areas. 

Given the current position, the agent is at (37,15). Moving east once would take it to (38,15), which is a '.' (floor). Then moving east again to (39,15), which is the boulder. Then pushing east would move the boulder to (40,15), which is a '.' (floor) next to the fountain. 

So the next action should be to move east towards the boulder, then push it east. But the agent needs to do this in two steps: first move east, then push east. 

Since the last action was west, and the agent is now at (37,15), moving east would be the first step. However, the observation after moving west showed that the boulder is adjacent southeast and southwest. Maybe the agent needs to check the current positions again. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent is already next to the boulder. Let me check the map again. The agent's position is x=37, y=15, and the boulder is at x=39, y=15. So the agent is one tile west of the boulder. Therefore, to push the boulder east, the agent needs to move east once to get next to it, then push east. 

So the correct action now would be to move east to get beside the boulder, then push east. But the last action was west, bringing the agent to x=37. Now, moving east once would reach x=38, then again to x=39 (the boulder). Then push east. 

However, the previous attempts to push resulted in failure, possibly because the agent wasn't in the correct position. So the first step is to move east to get next to the boulder. 

Looking at the current observation, the agent is at (37,15). The boulder is at (39,15). The tiles between them are '.' (floor), so moving east twice is possible. 

Therefore, the next action should be to move east to approach the boulder, then push east. But since the agent can only take one action per step, the immediate action is to move east toward the boulder. 

Alternatively, if the agent is already adjacent, then push. But according to the map, the agent is two tiles away from the boulder. So moving east once is needed. 

Thus, the best action now is to move east.

67,push east,"<reasoning>
Let's see where I am. The agent is at position (38, 15). There's a boulder to the west, near westnorthwest. The goal is to push the boulder onto the fountain. The fountain is very near eastsoutheast. The stairs up are at westsouthwest, but I don't think I need those right now.

I just moved west to (38, 15) after failing to push north due to bars. The previous attempts to move north or south into the bars didn't work. Now, looking at the map, the boulder is adjacent to the southwest. Wait, the last observation says the boulder is adjacent southwest. So maybe the boulder is to the south or west of the agent's current position.

The agent's current position is (38,15). The boulder is adjacent southwest, which would be (37,16) or (38,16). Let me check the map again. The map shows at position (38,15), there's a `...@{..`#` which includes the boulder symbol `{`. Wait, in the map, the ninth line (y=9?) has `#<..``{.{#` — maybe the boulder is at (38,15)? Or perhaps the map's formatting is a bit off. The cursor is at (38,15), which is marked with `@`, so the boulder must be nearby.

Looking at the language observation, the boulder is adjacent southwest. So from (38,15), southwest would be (38,16). But I need to check if there's a path to push the boulder. To push the boulder southwest (i.e., towards the fountain at eastsoutheast), I need to check if the space behind the boulder is unoccupied. Wait, the boulder is adjacent southwest, so the direction to push would be towards southwest. But the agent is at (38,15). To push the boulder southwest, the agent needs to move into the boulder's position and then push it. So first, move west to be next to the boulder, then push west or southwest.

Wait, the boulder is adjacent southwest. So from the agent's position (38,15), moving west to (37,15) would put the agent next to the boulder if the boulder is at (38,15) southwest, which would be (37,16). Hmm, maybe the coordinates are a bit confusing. Alternatively, the boulder could be at (38,14) if adjacent southwest from (38,15). But the map shows the boulder symbol `{` at position (38,15) in the map line: `#...@{..`#`. So the agent is at (38,15), and the boulder is at the same position? That can't be right because the agent is there. Maybe the `{` is to the east or west.

Looking at the map line: `#...@{..`#` — the agent's position is the `@`, and the `{` is next to it to the east. So the boulder is at (39,15). That makes sense. So the agent is at (38,15), and the boulder is at (39,15). The language observation says the boulder is adjacent south and southwest. Wait, if the agent is at (38,15), then south would be (38,16), and southwest would be (37,16). But the boulder is at (39,15), so adjacent east. Maybe there's a misunderstanding in the directions.

Alternatively, perhaps the boulder is at (38,16), adjacent south. But the map shows the boulder at (39,15). Let me re-examine the map. The ninth line (assuming y=9) has `#<..``{.{#`. The agent's position is (38,15), which would correspond to the `@` in the ninth line. The `{` is at position 39 in that line, so (39,15). So the boulder is to the east of the agent. The language observation says the boulder is adjacent south and southwest. That seems conflicting. Maybe the directions are relative to the boulder.

If the boulder is at (39,15), then adjacent to it would be (39,14) north, (40,15) east, (39,16) south, and (38,15) west. So the agent is at (38,15), west of the boulder. The boulder's adjacent positions are north, east, south, and west. The language observation might have a typo, saying south and southwest. But regardless, the agent needs to push the boulder towards the fountain at eastsoutheast.

To push the boulder eastward towards the fountain, the agent should move east into the boulder's position and then push east. So first, move east from (38,15) to (39,15), then push east. But wait, the boulder is already at (39,15). So the agent is next to it. The message says ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain"" when trying to push north or south. So perhaps the agent needs to move east to be adjacent to the boulder and then push east.

Looking at the previous actions, the agent tried moving north, west, south, etc., but the bars are blocking. The correct approach is to get next to the boulder and push it. Since the boulder is at (39,15), the agent is at (38,15). So moving east to (39,15) would allow the agent to push it east. But the agent's current position is already west of the boulder. Wait, no—the agent is at (38,15), and the boulder is at (39,15). So the agent is adjacent to the boulder to the west. To push the boulder east, the agent needs to move into the boulder's position (east) and then push. So first, move east once to be next to the boulder, then push east.

In the last observation, the agent moved west to (38,15) and then tried pushing east, which didn't work because the action was invalid. The valid action now is to move east to (39,15), then push east. But the agent needs to check if the space behind the boulder (to the east) is clear. The language observation says the boulder is adjacent south and southwest. So the space to the east of the boulder (40,15) might be a valid push direction if it's not blocked by bars or obstacles.

Looking at the language observation, bars are very near in many directions, but the specific adjacent areas for the boulder are south and southwest. The east direction from the boulder (40,15) isn't mentioned as having bars, so it's likely a free space. Therefore, the correct action is to move east to be next to the boulder and then push east towards the fountain.

68,push south,"<reasoning>
The agent needs to push a boulder onto a fountain in Boxoban. The current position is (38,15). The map shows a boulder near westnorthwest and another east. The goal is to get the boulder onto the fountain.

Looking at the observations, the boulder at westnorthwest is probably closer. The previous actions tried moving west, east, north, and south, but there are bars blocking some paths. The message says ""You cannot pass through the bars,"" so moving north isn't possible.

The player is at (38,15). The boulder adjacent southwest. So maybe the boulder is to the southwest of the player's current position. To push it onto the fountain, which is adjacent southeast, the agent needs to position the boulder there.

Wait, the language observation says ""boulder adjacent south and southwest."" So the boulder is south or southwest of the player. If the player moves south, can they push the boulder? But earlier attempts to push south resulted in ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" That might mean the boulder is blocked or there's something behind it.

Alternatively, maybe the boulder is to the westnorthwest. The agent tried moving west multiple times and ended up at x=38. The boulder very near westnorthwest might be at a different coordinate. The cursor is at (38,15), so westnorthwest would be a position northwest of that. But how to reach it?

The stairs are up near westsouthwest, which might be a different area. The agent needs to focus on the boulders. Since the fountain is adjacent southeast, perhaps the agent needs to move towards the southeast area where the fountain is.

But movement is blocked by bars. The agent is stuck between bars to the north and perhaps other obstacles. The valid moves are probably south, east, or west, but pushing requires the space behind the boulder to be free.

Since pushing east didn't work before because of bars, maybe try pushing the boulder to the south. If the boulder is adjacent south, pushing it south would move it towards the fountain at southeast. But the agent needs to be in the correct position to push.

Wait, the boulder is adjacent south and southwest. So if the agent is at (38,15), moving south to (38,16) would allow pushing the boulder south to (38,17), which might be towards the fountain. But the message said earlier that pushing south didn't work. Maybe there's an obstacle behind the boulder.

Alternatively, maybe the agent should move west to reach the boulder at westnorthwest. But moving west got to (37,15), and pushing east from there didn't work because of bars.

Another approach: check the map. The map shows ########## in many rows, which are likely walls or bars. The agent is in a corridor. The boulder at westnorthwest might be in a different part of the map. Since the agent is stuck in a corridor with bars blocking north, maybe they need to find a way to navigate around the bars.

But the immediate goal is to push a boulder to a fountain. The fountain is adjacent southeast, so the agent needs to get the boulder there. If the boulder is adjacent south, pushing it south towards the fountain. But earlier attempts failed, so maybe the path is blocked.

Wait, the message says ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" That implies there's an obstacle behind the boulder. So when trying to push, the space behind the boulder is occupied. Therefore, the boulder can't be moved further in that direction unless the obstacle is removed or moved.

In this case, maybe the agent needs to move the agent themselves to a position where they can push the boulder in a direction where the path is clear. For example, if the boulder is south of the agent, and the agent pushes it south, but there's a bar or another boulder behind it, then it's stuck.

Looking at the language observation: ""boulder adjacent south and southwest."" So the boulder is at (38,16) south, and maybe (37,15) southwest. The agent is at (38,15). To push the southern boulder, the agent needs to be south of it, but the agent is already adjacent. So pushing south would require the space at (38,16) to be free. But if there's a bar or another obstacle there, the push fails.

The bars very near north, etc., but the specific area south might be clear. Alternatively, maybe the fountain is at (38,17), and pushing the boulder there requires moving it past obstacles.

Alternatively, the agent could try pushing the boulder west. If the boulder is southwest, pushing west might move it towards the stairs or another area. But the goal is the fountain southeast.

This is getting a bit confusing. The key is to find a valid push action that moves a boulder towards a fountain without hitting an obstacle. Given the previous failures, perhaps the agent needs to try a different direction. Maybe the boulder at westnorthwest can be pushed east into the fountain. But the agent is at (38,15), and the boulder is westnorthwest, which might be at (37,14) or similar. To push it east, the agent would need to move west to reach it, then push east.

But the agent tried moving west to (37,15) and then pushing east, but that resulted in a default north action due to invalid input. So perhaps the correct action is to move west to the boulder's position and then push east.

Alternatively, since the agent is at (38,15), and the boulder is adjacent southwest (position (37,15)), pushing west from there would move the boulder to (36,15), but that's not towards the fountain. The fountain is southeast.

This is tricky. Maybe the best bet is to keep trying to push the southern boulder, assuming the path behind it is clear. If pushing south doesn't work, maybe the agent needs to move in another direction to create a path.

But given the information, the available actions are north, south, east, west, and push in those directions. Since north is blocked by bars, the agent should try south, east, or west pushes.

The last valid action before defaults was ""push east"", but that didn't work. Maybe ""push south"" again, but why did it fail before? Unless there's a bar or another boulder behind the southern boulder.

Alternatively, the agent might need to move the boulder in a different direction. For example, if the boulder is at (38,16), pushing it south to (38,17) towards the fountain. But if there's a bar at (38,17), that would block it.

Given the lack of clear information, the safest bet is to retry pushing the southern boulder, as it's closest to the fountain. So the action would be ""push south"".

",-0.001,False
69,east,"<reasoning>
I need to figure out how to move the boulder in Boxoban. Let's look at the current state. The agent is at (38, 15). There's a boulder adjacent to the southeast and south. The fountain is adjacent to the east. The problem is the bars blocking certain directions.

The previous attempts to push the boulder north, east, or south didn't work because of the bars. The message says ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" So the boulder must be stuck behind something. Let me check the map again.

The map shows that to the east there's a `@` symbol (the agent) and some symbols like `{`, `.` which might be walls or obstacles. The bars are very near in many directions, especially north. So the boulder must be adjacent to the south or southeast. Since the agent tried pushing south before and it didn't work, maybe the boulder is blocked by another object there.

Wait, the language observation says ""boulder adjacent south and southwest."" So the boulder is to the south and southwest of the agent. To push it, the agent needs to be positioned to push it in a direction where there's no obstacle behind it. For example, if the boulder is to the south, the agent should be north of it and push south, but only if there's empty space or a fountain behind the boulder.

But the agent is at (38,15). If the boulder is south, then pushing it south would require the cell (38,16) to be free or a fountain. Looking at the map, the cell south of the agent (38,15) might be a wall or bar. The map shows ""##########"" which are probably walls. So the agent can't push the boulder south because it's blocked by bars.

Alternatively, maybe the boulder is to the southeast. The agent is at (38,15). Southeast would be (39,16). But the agent tried moving east and south before. The fountain is adjacent to the east, so pushing the boulder towards the fountain might be the goal. But if the path is blocked by bars, that's not possible.

Wait, the stairs are up near westsouthwest, but the agent's goal is to push boulders onto fountains. The fountain is at eastsoutheast. So maybe the boulder needs to be moved east towards the fountain. But the agent is at (38,15), and the boulder is southeast and south. If the agent moves east to (39,15), then they can try pushing the boulder east. But earlier attempts to push east resulted in messages about bars. Let me check the previous observations.

In the history, when the agent tried pushing east, the message was ""You cannot pass through the bars."" So the cell east of the boulder is blocked by bars. Therefore, to push the boulder east, the agent needs to position themselves so that pushing the boulder east would place it onto the fountain, and the path behind the boulder (east of the boulder) must be clear or a fountain.

Looking at the current cursor position (38,15), the boulder is adjacent southeast and south. So the boulder is at (39,15) and (38,16). If the agent is at (38,15), pushing the boulder south would try to move it to (38,16), but if that's a bar, it's blocked. Alternatively, pushing the boulder southeast to (39,16), but again, bars might be there.

Wait, the fountain is at eastsoutheast, which would be (40,16) or similar. The agent's current position is (38,15). The boulder is at (39,15) and (38,16). To get the boulder onto the fountain, maybe the agent needs to move it east to (39,15) towards the fountain. But how?

If the agent moves east to (39,15), then they can try pushing the boulder east to (40,15). If (40,15) is a fountain, that would solve the problem. But in the current observations, the fountain is very near eastsoutheast, which might be (39,16) or (40,16). The agent needs to check the map again.

The map shows that at position (39,16), there's a `<` which might be the fountain. So the boulder needs to be moved to (39,16). But the boulder is currently at (39,15) and (38,16). To push it east, the agent would need to be to the west of the boulder. The agent is at (38,15), so moving east to (39,15) and then pushing east would move the boulder to (40,15). But if (40,15) is a bar, that's not possible. Alternatively, if the agent pushes the boulder southeast from (38,15) by moving east and south, but that might not align.

Alternatively, maybe the agent should move south to (38,16), where the boulder is adjacent, and then push it south to (38,17). But again, bars might block that.

Another approach: the agent is stuck because the boulder is blocked by bars. The only way to move the boulder is to find a direction where there's no obstacle behind it. Since the boulder is adjacent south and southwest, perhaps pushing it southwest would require the agent to be at (37,15) and push the boulder to (37,16). But the agent is at (38,15), so moving west to (37,15) and then pushing southwest might work if the path is clear.

But looking at the map, west of the agent (38,15) is (37,15), which has a `...@{..`#` structure. The `{` might be a door or another obstacle. Not sure. Alternatively, the agent could move south to (38,16) and then push the boulder southwest to (37,17), but again, unsure about obstacles.

This is tricky. The key is to find a direction where pushing the boulder doesn't hit a bar. Given the previous attempts, maybe pushing east is not possible due to bars. The agent needs to reposition. Maybe moving west to (37,15) and then trying to push the boulder in a different direction.

Alternatively, since the fountain is to the east, perhaps the agent should move the boulder east towards it. But how? The agent is at (38,15), and the boulder is at (39,15). If the agent moves east to (39,15), they can then push the boulder east to (40,15). If that cell is a fountain, that's the solution. But the message says the agent tried pushing east before and failed because of bars. So maybe (40,15) is a bar.

In that case, the agent needs to find another way. Perhaps pushing the boulder north? But the bars are far north, so maybe not. Alternatively, pushing the boulder southwest towards the stairs, but the stairs are up, which might not be the goal.

Wait, the goal is to push boulders onto fountains. The fountain is at eastsoutheast, so the agent needs to get the boulder there. The current boulder is at (39,15) and (38,16). To get it to (40,16), the agent would need to move it south and east. But the agent is at (38,15). Maybe moving east to (39,15), then pushing the boulder south to (39,16), which is the fountain.

But how? The agent is at (38,15). If they move east to (39,15), then they can push the boulder south to (39,16). If that cell is a fountain, then that's the solution. But in the previous observations, the fountain is adjacent east, which might be (39,16). Let me check the cursor position. The cursor is at (38,15), and the fountain is adjacent east. So east of the agent is (39,15), which is where the boulder is. So if the agent moves east to (39,15), they are next to the boulder. Then, pushing the boulder south to (39,16) would place it on the fountain. But is (39,16) a fountain?

Yes, according to the language observation, the fountain is very near eastsoutheast. So (39,16) is likely the fountain. Therefore, the correct action is for the agent to move east to (39,15) and then push the boulder south to (39,16). However, in the previous steps, the agent tried pushing east and got a message about bars. Maybe because they didn't move into position first.

So the correct sequence would be:

1. Move east from (38,15) to (39,15).
2. Push the boulder south to (39,16), which is the fountain.

But in the current state, the agent is at (38,15), and the boulder is adjacent southeast and south. So to push the boulder south, the agent needs to be north of it. The boulder's south position is (38,16), so the agent is already north of that part. If the agent pushes the boulder south, it would go to (38,17), but that's probably a bar. Alternatively, the boulder's southeast position is (39,16), so to push it southeast, the agent would need to be at (38,15) and push it in the southeast direction, which would move it to (39,16). That's the fountain.

But pushing in the southeast direction isn't a basic north/south/east/west action. The allowed actions are the four directions. So to push the boulder southeast, the agent has to move diagonally? No, the game probably allows pushing in the four cardinal directions, and if the boulder is in a adjacent cell, pushing towards a direction that the boulder can move into.

So, the agent is at (38,15). The boulder is at (39,15) (east) and (38,16) (south). To push the boulder east into the fountain at (39,16), the agent needs to be at (39,15) and push east. But the agent is at (38,15). So first, move east to (39,15), then push east. However, the previous attempt to push east resulted in a message about bars, which might mean that the cell east of the boulder (40,15) is blocked.

Looking at the map, the cell (40,15) is part of the `##########` wall, so pushing the boulder east from (39,15) to (40,15) is impossible. Therefore, the agent cannot push the boulder east. Then, the only option is to push it south or southwest.

Pushing south from (38,15) would move the boulder from (38,16) to (38,17), but that's likely a bar. Alternatively, pushing the boulder southwest from (38,15) would move it to (37,16), but again, check if that's possible.

The agent needs to find a direction where the boulder can be pushed without hitting a bar. Since the fountain is to the east, maybe pushing the boulder south into a different position, then east.

Alternatively, the agent should move south to (38,16), which is adjacent to the boulder, and then push it south to (38,17), but that's blocked by bars.

This is really challenging. Given the constraints, the best action might be to move west to (37,15) and then try to push the boulder in a different direction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the agent's current position is (38,15). The boulder is to the southeast (39,16) and south (38,16). If the agent moves south to (38,16), they are next to the boulder's south side. Then, pushing the boulder south to (38,17) is blocked by bars. So that's no good.

Alternatively, moving east to (39,15) and then pushing the boulder south to (39,16), which is the fountain. Even if the cell (40,15) is a bar, pushing the boulder to (39,16) would place it on the fountain, completing the level. But how does the game handle pushing into a fountain? It should work as the goal is to push boulders onto fountains.

So the correct action sequence would be:

1. Move east to (39,15).
2. Push south to (39,16) (fountain).

But in the previous attempt, pushing east directly resulted in a bar block. However, moving east first to get into position might allow pushing south into the fountain.

Therefore, the next action should be to move east to (39,15), then push south. But since the agent is currently at (38,15), moving east is valid. Let's check the map again. The cell (39,15) is part of the `...@{..`#` structure. The `{` might be a door that's open or closed. Assuming it's passable, moving east is okay.

So the agent should move east to (39,15), then push south to (39,16), which is the fountain.

",-0.001,False
70,push south,"<reasoning>
Let's see where I am right now. I'm playing Boxoban, and the goal is to push all the boulders onto the fountains. The map looks a bit complicated with bars and dark areas, but I can see some key elements.

First, looking at my position: I'm at (39, 15). The cursor shows me as a knight. There's a boulder near east, and a fountain near eastsoutheast. The stairs up are near westsouthwest, which might not be relevant right now. 

The main goal is to push the boulder onto the fountain. The current observations mention a boulder adjacent to southeast and south. Wait, in the latest map, the boulder is at position (39,15) adjacent to south and southwest. But I'm at (39,15) as the agent. Wait, no—the agent's position is (39,15), and the boulder is adjacent southeast and south. Let me check the map again.

The map shows:

...
#....@..`#  (this is my position at x=39, y=15)
#<..``{.{# 
...

The `<` symbol probably represents the boulder. So the boulder is to the southeast of my position. The fountain is adjacent southeast, so maybe the fountain is next to the boulder. My goal is to push the boulder towards the fountain.

Looking at the possible actions, I need to move or push the boulder. Since the boulder is to the southeast, pushing it east or south might work. But I need to check the surroundings. The bars adjacent north, northeast, and northwest might be obstacles. 

If I try to push the boulder south, I need to ensure there's space behind it. The message says ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain"" when I pushed before, so maybe the boulder is blocked. Looking at the observations, the boulder adjacent southeast and south—so the boulder is at (39,16) perhaps, and pushing it south would take it to (39,17). But are there obstacles there? The bars very near in various directions, but maybe the path is clear.

Alternatively, pushing the boulder east. If I'm at (39,15), pushing east would take the boulder to (40,15). But is there a space there? The map shows `#<..``{.{#` which might mean that east of my current position is a wall (`#`) or another obstacle. The `<` is the boulder, so east of me is the boulder, and beyond that, maybe a wall or another obstacle.

Wait, the map's ninth line (assuming y=15 is the ninth line) is `#<..``{.{#`, so at x=39, y=15, the character is '@' (me), and the next position to the east (x=40, y=15) is '<' which is the boulder. Then to the east of the boulder (x=41, y=15) is `` which might be floor, but need to check. However, the bars very near include eastnortheast, southeast, etc., so maybe there are obstacles beyond.

But the fountain is very near eastsoutheast, which might be at (41,16) or similar. So pushing the boulder east towards the southeast direction could get it closer to the fountain.

Alternatively, pushing the boulder south. If I push it south, from (39,15) to (39,16), but the boulder is already adjacent south. So maybe pushing it further south into the fountain.

Wait, the latest observation says the boulder is adjacent southeast and south. So the boulder is at (39,16), southeast of me, and south would be (39,16) as well? That doesn't make sense. Maybe the coordinates are a bit different. Let me clarify:

In the map, each line represents a row, and each character a column. The agent's position is (39,15), which is the 39th column (x) and 15th row (y). The line for y=15 is `#....@..`#`, so the agent is at x=39 (since the '@' is the 8th character in that line, but considering the indexing might start at 0 or 1). Wait, perhaps the map's coordinates are a bit different. This part might be tricky without exact coordinate mapping.

Alternatively, focusing on the relative positions. The boulder is to the southeast and south of the agent. So if the agent is at (39,15), moving east would take them to (40,15), and the boulder is at (40,15) as the '<' symbol. So pushing the boulder east would require moving it from (40,15) to (41,15). But the map's next line (y=16) for x=41 is `{`, which might be a floor or a wall. The bars very near include southeast, so maybe there's a bar at (41,16), making it impossible to push the boulder further east.

In that case, pushing the boulder south might be better. From (40,15) to (40,16). The fountain is adjacent southeast, which could be at (41,16). So if the boulder is pushed south to (40,16), then the next step could be to push it east towards the fountain.

But the agent is at (39,15). To push the boulder east, the agent needs to be next to it. Since the boulder is at (40,15), the agent is already adjacent. So the correct action would be to push the boulder east. However, the previous attempts to push resulted in failure, possibly because the path is blocked. The observation says ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain"" when pushing north, south, etc. 

Looking at the latest language observation, the bars very near include eastnortheast, southeast, etc. So pushing the boulder east might be blocked by a bar at (41,15) or (41,16). Therefore, the best option is to try pushing the boulder south towards the fountain. The agent is at (39,15), the boulder is at (40,15). To push south, the agent needs to move the boulder from (40,15) to (40,16). If that space is clear, then pushing south would be possible. 

Checking the map for y=16, the line is `#<..``{.{#` (assuming y=15 is the agent's line, y=16 is the next line down). At x=40, y=16, the character is '`', which is a floor, so not a wall. Therefore, pushing the boulder south to (40,16) should be possible. Then the boulder would be one step closer to the fountain at southeast.

So the action should be to push the boulder south. The correct command for that in MiniHack is ""push south"".

",-0.001,False
71,push south,"<reasoning>
The agent is trying to solve Boxoban in MiniHack. The goal is to push all the boulders onto the fountains. From the observations, the current position is (39,15). The cursor shows the knight's location. The map shows several bars and dark areas, which are probably walls or obstacles. There's a boulder near the east and westnorthwest. The fountain is near eastsoutheast. The stairs up are at westsouthwest.

The agent's previous actions included moving south, west, and trying to push east or south, but those didn't work because of bars blocking the way. The last message was ""You cannot pass through the bars."" So the bars are solid obstacles.

Looking at the map, the knight is at (39,15). The east direction has a boulder. The fountain is at eastsoutheast, which is probably to the southeast of the current position. The boulder adjacent to the south and southwest might be near the fountain. The agent needs to navigate around the bars to reach the boulder.

Since pushing the boulder east didn't work before, maybe the boulder is blocked by a bar. The agent needs to find a path to the boulder. The current position is west of the boulder (since the boulder is near east). So moving east might be possible if there's a path. But the observation says trying to push east before resulted in failure, possibly because the boulder is against a bar or another obstacle.

Alternatively, moving south might allow the agent to get around the bars and approach the boulder from another direction. The bars adjacent north, northeast, and northwest suggest that moving north is blocked. The agent could try moving south, then maybe east when possible. 

Another option is to check if the boulder near westnorthwest can be pushed. The agent is at (39,15), and the boulder is near westnorthwest, which would be to the northwest. Moving west or north might reach that boulder. However, the bars in the north direction might block that path.

The stairs up are at westsouthwest, which is southwest of the current position. Maybe moving southwest could lead to a different area, but the goal is to push the boulder to the fountain, so that might not be necessary right now.

The agent needs to prioritize pushing the boulders onto the fountains. The fountain is at eastsoutheast, so moving southeast towards it. But the path is blocked by bars. The boulder is adjacent to the south and southwest, which might be near the fountain. So perhaps pushing the boulder south or southwest would move it towards the fountain.

Wait, the last observation says the boulder is adjacent south and southwest. So if the agent can push the boulder southwest, that might place it on the fountain. To do that, the agent needs to position themselves behind the boulder. However, the current position is east of the boulder (since the boulder is near east). So maybe moving east first, then pushing south or southwest.

But earlier attempts to push east failed because of bars. So maybe the boulder is stuck against a bar. In that case, the agent needs to find another way to move the boulder by repositioning it. Alternatively, check if there's a way around the bars to get to the other side of the boulder.

The map has a lot of bars, making it tricky. The agent could try moving west to get around the bars and approach the boulder from the northwest. But the cursor's position is (39,15), so moving west would go to (38,15), which was previously observed. From there, maybe moving north or south?

Alternatively, since the boulder is adjacent south and southwest, maybe the agent can move south to get behind it and then push southwest. But the agent's current position is (39,15). Moving south to (39,16), then see if there's a path to the boulder.

Looking at the map, the line for y=15 has a `...@{..`#` which likely represents the agent's position (@) and surroundings. The boulder is near east, so maybe at (40,15). To push it east, the agent needs to be adjacent and move east. But the previous attempts to push east resulted in failure, possibly because there's a bar at (40,15) east of the boulder.

In that case, the agent should look for alternative paths. Maybe move west to (38,15) and then try pushing the boulder from the west. If the boulder is at (39,15)'s east, then from (38,15), pushing west into the boulder wouldn't work. Alternatively, push the boulder north or south if possible.

The bars adjacent north, northeast, and northwest around the agent's position suggest that moving north is blocked. So the agent might need to move south or east, but those directions have bars or boulders.

Another approach: since the fountain is at eastsoutheast, maybe the boulder needs to be pushed there. If the boulder is currently at east, perhaps pushing it further east into the fountain's location. But the bars are blocking that path. So the agent needs to find a way to move around the bars to get the boulder past them.

Alternatively, check if the other boulder (near westnorthwest) can be moved towards a fountain. If there's another fountain, but the observations only mention one at eastsoutheast. So focusing on that.

Given the agent's current position and the obstacles, the best action might be to move south to get a clearer path or to find a way around the bars. Alternatively, try pushing the boulder south if possible.

Wait, the boulder is adjacent south and southwest. So if the agent moves south to (39,16), maybe they can position themselves to push the boulder southwest towards the fountain. But need to check if that direction is clear.

Given the previous failures, maybe the agent should try moving west to (38,15) and then see if pushing the boulder from there. Or move south to (39,16) and then try pushing east or southwest.

Given the obscurity of the map layout, the agent might need to explore more. However, the priority is to push the boulder onto the fountain. Given the current information, the best bet is to attempt to push the boulder south or southwest from the current position.

But since pushing east didn't work before, perhaps trying to push the boulder south. So the action would be ""push south"".

",-0.001,False
72,west,"<reasoning>
Let's see what's going on here. The agent is stuck trying to push a boulder but keeps getting the message that they can't move it. The latest observation shows the agent at (39,15) trying to push the boulder south, north, east, etc., but the bars are blocking the way.

First, I need to understand the map layout based on the observations. The boulder is adjacent to the south and southwest, and there's a fountain to the southeast. The bars are all around the north, so maybe the boulder is near a wall of bars, preventing it from being pushed in certain directions.

The agent tried pushing east and south but got blocked by bars. The message says ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain,"" which probably means there's an obstacle behind the boulder when trying to push. So the boulder might be against a bar or another obstacle, making it impossible to push further in that direction.

Looking at the cursor position (39,15), the agent is next to the boulder. To push the boulder, the agent needs to be positioned behind it. If the boulder is adjacent to the southwest, maybe the agent should try pushing it west or south-west. But the latest attempts were pushing east and south, which aren't working.

Wait, the last valid action was ""east"" which moved the agent to (39,15). The boulder is adjacent south and southwest. So if the agent is at (39,15), pushing the boulder southwest would require moving the agent to (38,14) to push it southwest. But the problem is the bars are blocking the way. The bars adjacent north, northeast, and northwest, so moving south or east might hit the bars.

Alternatively, maybe the boulder is stuck between bars and the agent needs to find a different direction to push. Since the fountain is to the southeast, maybe the goal is to push the boulder towards there. But the boulder is currently adjacent south and southwest, so perhaps pushing it south into the fountain would solve it. But the agent can't because of the bars.

Wait, the latest message after pushing south was ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" That suggests there's something blocking the boulder's path when pushing south. Maybe another bar or obstacle. The bars very near south, so pushing the boulder south into a bar wouldn't work.

So the agent needs to find a way to position themselves so they can push the boulder around the bars. Since the agent is at (39,15), maybe moving west to (38,15) and then pushing the boulder south would work if there's no bar there. But according to the language observation, bars are adjacent north, northeast, and northwest. So moving west from (39,15) to (38,15), which was previously done, and then pushing east might be possible if there's space.

But the boulder is at (39,15) adjacent south and southwest. So if the agent is at (38,15), they can try pushing the boulder east into (39,15), but that's where the agent is. Wait, maybe the boulder is at (39,14) or something. The map shows the boulder adjacent south and southwest of the agent. So if the agent is at (39,15), the boulder might be at (39,16) (south) and (38,15) (west)? Or (40,15) east? Hmm, the map display isn't very clear, but the language observation says the boulder is adjacent south and southwest.

Assuming the boulder is to the south of the agent, at (39,16), then pushing it south would require the agent to be at (39,16), but the agent is at (39,15). So the agent needs to move south to (39,16) and then push further. But the bars are very near south, so that might not be possible.

Alternatively, maybe the agent should move west to (38,15) and then push the boulder east into a direction where there's no bars. But the boulder is already adjacent east? The language observation says ""boulder adjacent south and southwest."" So maybe the boulder is at (38,15) southwest of the agent's position (39,15). So the boulder is at (38,14), and pushing it south into (38,13) might be possible if there's no bars there.

But the agent needs to be behind the boulder to push it. So if the boulder is at (38,14), the agent is at (39,15). To push it south, the agent would need to be at (38,14), but that's where the boulder is. Instead, the agent should move to (38,15) and then push the boulder south to (38,14). But the bars adjacent north, northeast, and northwest at the agent's current position might block that.

This is getting confusing. Maybe the best approach is to try pushing the boulder in a different direction that's not blocked by bars. Since pushing east and south hasn't worked, perhaps trying to push west or north-west. But the agent needs to position themselves correctly.

Looking at the cursor position (39,15), the agent is next to the boulder. If the boulder is to the southwest, then moving west to (38,15) and then pushing the boulder north-west might work if there's no bars in that direction. But the language observation says bars are adjacent north, northeast, and northwest. So pushing the boulder north-west would hit the bars.

Alternatively, maybe the agent should move north to find a way around, but the bars are far north. This is tricky. Perhaps the solution is to keep trying different directions, but the tip says to avoid repeating actions. The agent has already tried south, east, west, and pushing in various directions, but nothing works. Maybe the boulder is stuck between bars and the only way is to find a path around it.

Wait, the stairs up are near westsouthwest, so maybe the agent should go there, but the goal is to push the boulder onto the fountain. The fountain is near eastsoutheast. The boulder is near east, so pushing it towards the southeast fountain might be the solution. But the bars are blocking that path.

Alternatively, the agent might need to move the boulder to a different position where it can be pushed towards the fountain. Since the boulder is adjacent south and southwest, maybe pushing it southwest into a space that leads towards the fountain. But the bars are adjacent northwest, so that might not be possible.

Hmm. Maybe the agent needs to backtrack and find another way to position the boulder. The only valid move that hasn't been tried recently is moving north, but the bars are there. Alternatively, try pushing the boulder north, but that's blocked.

Wait, the agent's last valid action was ""east"" moving to (39,15). The boulder is adjacent south and southwest. So if the agent is at (39,15), pushing the boulder southwest would require moving it to (38,14). To do that, the agent needs to be at (38,15) and push the boulder southwest. But the agent is already at (39,15). So moving west to (38,15) and then pushing the boulder southwest.

So the sequence would be: west, then push southwest. But the problem is that the agent can't push diagonally in MiniHack, I think. Actions are only north, south, east, west, or pushing in those directions. So pushing southwest would require the agent to be adjacent to the boulder in the southwest direction and then push it southwest.

But in MiniHack, pushing is done by moving into the boulder's tile, which then moves the boulder in the same direction. So if the agent is to the northwest of the boulder, moving south into the boulder's tile would push it southwest.

In this case, the agent is at (39,15), and the boulder is at (38,14) (southwest of the agent). So the agent needs to move to (38,14) to push it. But how? The agent is at (39,15). To get to (38,14), the agent would have to move west to (38,15), then south to (38,14). But when moving south from (38,15) to (38,14), if there's a boulder there, the agent can try to push it. But the boulder is already at (38,14), so pushing it would require the agent to be adjacent.

Wait, the boulder is at (38,14), adjacent to the agent's current position (39,15) in the southwest direction. So the agent is to the northeast of the boulder. To push the boulder southwest, the agent needs to move into the boulder's tile, which is (38,14). So the agent can move west to (38,15), then south to (38,14), and then perhaps push the boulder further southwest. But the bars adjacent north, northeast, and northwest at (38,15) might block movement.

Alternatively, the agent can move west to (38,15) and then try to push the boulder east into (39,15), but that's where the agent is. That won't work.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe the best action here is to try pushing the boulder in a different direction that's not blocked by bars. Since pushing east and south haven't worked, perhaps pushing west or north. But the bars are adjacent north, northeast, and northwest, so pushing north or northwest would hit the bars.

Wait, the agent is at (39,15). The bars adjacent north, northeast, and northwest. So pushing north would go into a bar. Pushing northeast would go into a bar. Pushing northwest would go into a bar. Pushing east would go into a boulder or the agent's current position. Pushing south is into the boulder. So the only possible direction is west, but that's into an empty space (the agent moved west to (38,15) earlier and saw the boulder there).

Wait, the boulder is adjacent south and southwest of the agent. So when the agent is at (39,15), the boulder is either at (39,16) (south) or (38,15) (west). But the language observation says ""boulder adjacent south and southwest."" So southwest would be (38,14). So the boulder is at (38,14), southwest of the agent. Therefore, to push it southwest, the agent needs to be at (38,14), but that's where the boulder is. Instead, the agent can move to (38,15) (west) and then push the boulder south into (38,14), which is already where the boulder is. That doesn't make sense.

I think the problem is that the boulder is stuck between bars and the agent can't find a way to push it around. The only possible move is to try pushing it in a direction that's not blocked, but all directions seem blocked. Maybe the agent needs to move around to a different position to access the boulder from another side.

Alternatively, maybe the agent should go to the stairs up near westsouthwest to go to a different level, but the goal is to push the boulder here. So that's probably not the way.

Given all this, the best possible action the agent can take without getting blocked again is to move west to (38,15) and then try pushing the boulder east. But since the boulder is already adjacent east (if it's at (38,14)), pushing east from (38,15) would move it to (39,15), which is where the agent is. That's not helpful.

Alternatively, after moving west to (38,15), the agent can try pushing the boulder south into (38,14), but the bars are very near south, so that might be blocked.

Hmm. Maybe the agent should try pushing the boulder north, but the bars are adjacent north. That won't work.

In conclusion, the agent is stuck and needs to find a different approach. The only valid move that hasn't been tried recently is moving north, but that's blocked. Alternatively, the agent could try to find a path around the bars to access the boulder from another side. But given the current observations, the best bet is to keep trying to push the boulder in different directions, even if it's not working, but the tip says to avoid repeating actions. Since the agent has already tried south, east, west, and various pushes, maybe the next step is to try pushing the boulder north, even though it's blocked, but that's likely to fail again.

Alternatively, maybe the agent should move to a different position. For example, move north to see if there's a way around, but the bars are far north. That might not help.

Given all this, the safest action the agent can take without getting further stuck is to move west to (38,15) and then try pushing the boulder east. However, since pushing east into the agent's current position doesn't help, perhaps the agent should instead try pushing the boulder south from (38,15) to (38,14), assuming there's no bar there. But the bars are very near south, so that might be blocked.

Wait, the bars very near south are at the agent's current position (39,15). So moving south from (38,15) to (38,14) would be into an area with bars very near south. Maybe there's a path there.

Given the uncertainty, the best action is to move west to (38,15) and then attempt to push the boulder east. If that doesn't work, try pushing it south. But since previous pushes haven't worked, maybe the agent needs to explore other directions.

Alternatively, the agent could try picking up an item, but the inventory shows the agent has a sword, lance, shield, etc., but no keys or tools needed to remove bars.

In the end, the most logical action given the current position and observations is to move west and attempt to push the boulder in a direction that's not blocked by bars. So the agent moves west to (38,15) and then tries to push the boulder east.

73,push south,"<reasoning>
The agent needs to push a boulder into a fountain in Boxoban. Let's look at the current observations.

The agent is at position (38, 15). There's a boulder adjacent to the southeast and south. The fountain is adjacent to the southeast. So, the boulder is next to the fountain. But the message says trying to move the boulder fails. Wait, maybe the boulder is already next to the fountain, but not on it. So, the agent needs to push the boulder onto the fountain.

Looking at the map, the boulder is at (38, 15) south or southeast. The agent is at (38,15). If the boulder is south of the agent, pushing it south would move it into the fountain. But the agent tried ""push south"" before and it didn't work. Why?

Oh, the bars adjacent north, northeast, and northwest. So there are obstacles in those directions. The agent is blocked from moving north, northeast, or northwest. But the boulder is to the southeast or south.

Wait, the latest observation shows the boulder is adjacent southeast and south. So, the agent is facing a direction where the boulder is southeast or south. To push the boulder, the agent needs to be positioned to push it towards the fountain.

If the boulder is to the southeast, the agent should move east to get behind it. Alternatively, if it's south, move south and then push. But earlier attempts to push south resulted in failure. Maybe the boulder is blocked by another obstacle or not properly positioned.

Looking at the map, there's a '#' symbol which might be a wall or obstacle. The boulder is represented by '{' or '`'? In the map, the agent's position is marked with '@', and the boulder might be near there. The fountain is at eastsoutheast, so maybe the agent needs to navigate to get the boulder into that position.

Wait, the current cursor position is (38,15), and the boulder is adjacent southeast and south. So, the boulder is either at (39,16) or (39,15). If the agent is at (38,15), pushing east would move towards the boulder. But in previous steps, moving east got the agent to (39,15), but the boulder was there. Trying to push east again didn't work because of bars.

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to move south to get behind the boulder. If the boulder is south of the agent at (38,15), then moving south to (38,16) and then pushing south again. But the bars adjacent north, northeast, and northwest might block that path.

Wait, the bars are near north, northeast, and northwest. So the agent can't move north, northeast, or northwest. So the agent is surrounded on those sides. The only free directions are south, east, and west. But pushing the boulder east or south.

If the boulder is to the southeast, the agent should move east and then push south. But the agent tried pushing east before and it didn't work because of the bars. Maybe the boulder is stuck against a bar or another obstacle.

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to lift the boulder instead of pushing, but in Boxoban, you can only push, not lift. So the only option is to push the boulder in a direction that moves it towards the fountain.

Looking at the latest map, the agent is at (38,15). The boulder is at (39,15) (south) or (39,16) (southeast). The fountain is at eastsoutheast, which would be (39,16) or similar. If the boulder is at (39,15), pushing it south to (39,16) would place it on the fountain. But the agent's previous attempts to push south failed. Why?

Maybe there's an obstacle in the way. The bars very near north, northeast, etc., but perhaps the path south is blocked by another bar or object. Alternatively, the boulder is already on the fountain, but the observation doesn't show that.

Alternatively, the agent needs to reposition themselves. Since moving north is blocked, the agent can try moving east to get next to the boulder. But when the agent moved east to (39,15), the boulder was there, and pushing east again resulted in error due to bars.

Wait, the bars adjacent north, northeast, and northwest. So from position (38,15), moving north would hit a bar. East would hit a bar if there's one at (39,16). Maybe the boulder is at (39,15), and pushing south from there would move it to (39,16), which is the fountain. But the agent is at (38,15), so to push the boulder south, the agent needs to be adjacent to it. If the boulder is at (39,15), the agent can push it south by moving east first? No, because pushing requires being next to the boulder and moving in the direction away from you.

So, if the agent is at (38,15) and the boulder is at (39,15), the agent can push the boulder east (to (40,15)) or south (to (39,16)). But the bars might block that. The message says ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain,"" which implies there's an obstacle preventing movement.

Looking at the language observation, there are bars very near north, northeast, etc., but specifically, bars adjacent north, northeast, and northwest. So at (38,15), moving north would hit a bar, northeast to (39,16) might have a bar, and northwest to (37,14) maybe a bar. So pushing the boulder east from (39,15) would go to (40,15), but if there's a bar there, it won't work.

Alternatively, the boulder is at (39,16) (southeast of agent). Then, the agent can push it south to (39,17), but that's not towards the fountain. The fountain is eastsoutheast, which would be (40,16) or similar. So maybe the boulder needs to be moved east first, then south.

But the agent is at (38,15). To get behind the boulder at (39,16), the agent would need to move east to (39,15), then south to (39,16), then push east. But the agent can't move east to (39,15) without hitting a bar?

Wait, in the latest observation, when the agent was at (38,15), moving east took them to (39,15), and the boulder was there. But pushing east from (39,15) resulted in an error because of bars. So maybe there's a bar at (40,15), preventing the boulder from being pushed east.

Alternatively, the fountain is at (39,16), so pushing the boulder to (39,16) would place it on the fountain. If the boulder is at (38,15) south, pushing it south to (38,16). But is there a bar there? The agent can't move south because the message says they can't pass through bars, but pushing the boulder south might be possible if the path is clear.

This is getting confusing. Let me recap:

- Agent is at (38,15).
- Boulder is adjacent southeast and south.
- Fountain is adjacent southeast.
- Bars are blocking north, northeast, northwest.

So the boulder is probably at (39,15) (south) or (39,16) (southeast). If it's at (39,15), pushing south to (39,16) would reach the fountain. If that's possible, then the action should be ""push south"".

But previous attempts to push south failed. Why? Maybe because there's a bar at (39,16). The language observation says ""bars very near north, northeast, etc."", including southeast. So (39,16) might have a bar, preventing the boulder from being pushed there.

Alternatively, the boulder is already at the fountain, but the observation doesn't show it. Maybe the agent needs to check again.

Alternatively, the agent should try moving east to get next to the boulder. From (38,15) move east to (39,15), then push east. But pushing east might be blocked by a bar.

Looking at the latest map, the agent's position is on a '.' or another character. The boulder is represented by '`' or '{'. In the map, the line for y=15 is:

#...@{..`# 

So at (38,15), the agent is at position 7 (0-based index?), with '@'. The boulder is at position 8 ( '{' ) and 9 ( '`' ). So the boulders are at (38,15) adjacent east and southeast? Or maybe the agent is at (38,15), and the boulders are at (39,15) and (39,16).

In that case, to push the boulder at (39,15) south to (39,16), the agent needs to be adjacent. Since the agent is at (38,15), they can push the boulder east (to (40,15)) or south (to (39,16)). But pushing south would require the agent to be at (39,15), which they can't get to because moving south from (38,15) is blocked by bars.

Wait, the agent's cursor is at (38,15), and the bars adjacent north, northeast, and northwest. So moving north to (38,14) is blocked, northeast to (39,16) is blocked, northwest to (37,14) is blocked. So the agent can only move south, east, or west, but west would be to (37,15), which might be clear.

If the agent moves west to (37,15), then they can try pushing the boulder east. But the boulder is at (39,15) and (39,16). Moving west might not help.

Alternatively, the agent should try to lift the boulder, but in Boxoban, you can't lift, only push.

Another approach: since the fountain is at eastsoutheast, which is probably (40,16), the boulder needs to be moved there. The agent is at (38,15). To get the boulder to (40,16), the path would be east twice then south twice. But there are bars blocking the way.

Alternatively, the boulder is already next to the fountain. If the agent can push it onto the fountain, that would solve the problem. So the correct action is to push the boulder towards the fountain.

Given the agent's position and the boulder's location, the best action is to push the boulder east or south. But due to bar obstacles, pushing east might not be possible. So pushing south might be the way, but previous attempts failed. Maybe the correct direction is south.

Alternatively, the agent needs to reposition. Since moving north is blocked, maybe moving west and then pushing the boulder east.

But without knowing the exact layout, it's challenging. The key is to look for the boulder adjacent to the agent and the fountain, then push towards the fountain.

Given the latest information, the action should be to push the boulder south towards the fountain. So the chosen action is ""push south"".

74,push east,"<reasoning>
Let me try to figure out what to do next. The agent is stuck trying to push the boulder in different directions, but it's not working. The problem seems to be the bars blocking the way. The boulder is adjacent to the south and southwest, but there's a fountain near southeast. The goal is to push the boulder onto the fountain.

Looking at the map, the agent is at (38,15). The boulder is to the southeast and southwest. To push the boulder onto the fountain (which is adjacent southeast), the agent needs to position themselves so they can push the boulder south or southeast. But the bars are blocking the direct path. 

The message says ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" So maybe the agent is not adjacent correctly. The boulder is near east and westnorthwest. Wait, the latest observations show the boulder adjacent south and southwest. So the agent is trying to push it south, but maybe there's something in the way. The bars are adjacent north, northeast, and northwest, which are in the way. 

The agent needs to move around the bars to get a clear path. Since the boulder is south and southwest, maybe moving west to get behind it and then push east towards the fountain. But the agent tried west and east before, but the bars are still there. Alternatively, maybe the agent can move south to get closer to the boulder. 

Wait, the cursor position is (38,15). The boulder is adjacent south and southwest. If the agent moves south to (38,16), then they can try pushing the boulder east towards the fountain. But the map shows that the area south might have bars or other obstacles. Let me check the map again. The map shows a lot of ########## which are probably walls or bars. The agent's current position is in a corridor with bars nearby. 

The previous attempts to push east or south didn't work because the bars are blocking. So maybe the agent needs to reposition to the west or north to find a path. But the stairs are up near westsouthwest, which might be a dead end. 

Alternatively, since the fountain is very near eastsoutheast, maybe the agent should try to move the boulder east first. But the boulder is currently near east, so pushing it further east might get it onto the fountain. However, the bars adjacent north, northeast, and northwest are preventing that. 

The agent might need to navigate around the bars to get a clear path to the boulder. For example, moving north to get past the bars, then east to push the boulder. But the message says the agent can't pass through the bars when moving north. 

Hmm, this is tricky. The key is to find a direction where the agent can push the boulder without hitting bars. Since the boulder is adjacent south and southwest, pushing it southwest might place it on the fountain. But the agent needs to be positioned correctly. If the agent moves west to (37,15), then they can push the boulder southwest to (37,16), which is the fountain. 

Wait, the fountain is adjacent southeast. If the boulder is pushed east, that's where the fountain is. Let me check the latest observations. The fountain is adjacent east, so if the boulder is pushed east, it would reach the fountain. But the agent is trying to push east earlier, but it's blocked by bars. 

Wait, the current cursor position is (38,15). The boulder is adjacent southeast and south. So if the agent moves east to (39,15), they can push the boulder east to (40,15), which is the fountain. But the problem is the bars adjacent north, northeast, and northwest. Are there bars in the way between (38,15) and (39,15)? The map shows that the area is mostly bars and dark areas. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to move north around the bars. But the bars are adjacent north, so moving north would hit them. 

This is confusing. The agent keeps trying to push east or south but can't due to bars. The only way is to find a path around the bars to get a clear line to push the boulder. Maybe moving west to (37,15) and then pushing the boulder east. But how? The boulder is currently at (39,15) maybe? 

Wait, the latest map shows the agent at (38,15) with a boulder adjacent southeast. So the boulder is at (39,16) perhaps. If the agent moves east to (39,15), they can push the boulder east to (40,15), which is the fountain. But the bars are in the way. Maybe the bars are north of the agent, so moving east is possible if there's no obstacle. 

But according to the language observation, bars are adjacent north, northeast, and northwest. So moving east from (38,15) would go into (39,15), which might be clear if there are no bars there. The agent needs to check if the path is clear. 

Given that the agent's previous attempts to push east resulted in messages about bars, maybe the actual obstacle is that the boulder is blocked by another object. The latest message says ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain,"" which could mean there's something behind the boulder preventing it from being pushed further. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent is not adjacent correctly to the boulder. To push a boulder, the agent must be in the same row or column and adjacent to it, with an empty space behind the boulder. 

In the current position, the boulder is adjacent southeast (so to the southeast of the agent). To push it east, the agent needs to be to the northwest of the boulder. If the agent is at (38,15), the boulder would be at (39,16). To push east, the agent needs to be at (38,15) and push the boulder to (39,16) east to (40,16). But there's a fountain at eastsoutheast, which might be (40,15) or similar. 

This is getting a bit unclear. The key is to find a valid direction where the boulder can be pushed onto the fountain without obstacles. Since the fountain is eastsoutheast, pushing the boulder east or southeast might work. But the bars are blocking. 

The agent might need to move around the bars to get a clear path. For example, move north around the bars, then east to push the boulder. But moving north is blocked by bars. 

Alternatively, move west to get behind the boulder and then push it east. If the agent moves west to (37,15), then they can push the boulder east to (38,15), but that's where the agent is. Not helpful. 

Wait, the boulder is adjacent south and southwest. So from (38,15), the boulder could be at (38,16) south, or (37,16) southwest. If the agent is trying to push it south to (38,16), but there's a bar there. 

Alternatively, if the boulder is at (37,16) southwest, pushing it southwest to (37,17) might place it on the fountain. But the fountain is at eastsoutheast, which is the opposite direction. 

I think the best approach is to try pushing the boulder east again, even though it failed before, maybe the agent wasn't positioned correctly. Or try pushing it south. But the messages say it's not working. 

Alternatively, check if there's a clear path to the fountain by moving the agent in a different direction. Maybe moving south to get under the boulder and then push east. 

Given the agent's current position and the boulder's location, the correct action might be to push the boulder east. Even if it failed before, perhaps there was a temporary obstacle. So the next action should be push east again.

75,push south,"<reasoning>
The agent is stuck trying to push the boulder east but keeps failing. The previous attempts to push east resulted in the same message about bars blocking the way. The key here is to figure out if the boulder is indeed blocked by something else or if there's a different approach.

Looking at the map, the agent is at (38,15). The boulder is near east, which would be position (39,15) maybe. The message says ""You cannot pass through the bars,"" but the bars are adjacent north, northeast, and northwest. So the bars are around the agent's current position. When the agent tries to push east, the boulder might be against another obstacle, like a bar or a wall, preventing it from moving.

Wait, the boulder adjacent southeast and south in the language observation. So the boulder is at (38,15) has adjacent squares to the southeast and south. That would mean the boulder is at (38,16) or (37,15)? Maybe the boulder is south or southeast of the agent. If the agent is trying to push it east towards the fountain at eastsoutheast, but the boulder is blocked by bars or another obstacle.

Alternatively, perhaps the agent needs to reposition themselves to get a clear path. Maybe moving north or west to get around the bars and then push the boulder east. But the bars are adjacent north, northeast, and northwest, so moving north might hit a bar. West might let the agent get closer to the boulder.

Wait, the cursor is at (38,15), and the boulder is adjacent southeast and south. So if the boulder is south of the agent, the agent could try pushing it south towards the fountain. But the message when pushing south says ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" That suggests there's an obstacle behind the boulder when pushing south. Maybe another bar or wall.

Alternatively, maybe the boulder is stuck between bars. The agent needs to find a way to free the boulder by moving it in a direction that isn't blocked. If pushing east isn't working, maybe pushing south or west could work. Let me check the language observation again.

Bars very near north, northeast, etc., and the boulder adjacent southeast and south. So if the boulder is at (38,16), pushing it south would require it to go into (38,17), but there's a bar there. Or maybe the fountain is at eastsoutheast, which would be (39,16) or similar. The agent needs to get the boulder to the fountain. 

Since pushing east isn't working, maybe the agent should try moving around to the side of the boulder. Let's say the boulder is at (38,16). The agent is at (38,15). If the agent moves south to (38,16), they could then try pushing the boulder east. But the message when pushing south earlier said it failed. Maybe there's a bar in (38,16). 

Alternatively, the agent could move west to (37,15) and then try pushing the boulder east from there. If the bars are to the northwest, moving west might avoid them. Then, from (37,15), pushing east towards the boulder at (38,15) or (38,16) might work if there's no obstacle behind the boulder.

Another possibility is that the boulder is already adjacent to the fountain, but the agent isn't pushing it in the right direction. The fountain is at eastsoutheast, so if the boulder is near there, maybe pushing it southeast into the fountain. But the agent's current position is (38,15), so southeast would be (39,16). If the boulder is at (38,16), pushing it southeast to (39,16) where the fountain is, that could work. But how to get the boulder there without being blocked.

Given that all previous push east attempts failed due to bars, maybe the agent needs to find another way. Let's think about the map layout. The stairs up are at westsouthwest, which is probably a corner. The agent is in a corridor with bars all around. The boulder is near east, so perhaps in a dead end blocked by bars. The agent needs to use a different direction to push the boulder towards the fountain.

Another angle: the agent has a lance, which might be useful for pushing from a distance, but MiniHack typically requires physical proximity. So the agent must be adjacent to the boulder to push it. Since the boulder is adjacent southeast and south, the agent is north of the boulder. To push it east, the agent needs to be west of the boulder. But the agent is currently at (38,15), and the boulder is at (38,16) (if south) or (37,15) (if west). If the boulder is south, the agent is north, so to push east, the boulder would need to move into (39,16), which is the fountain's direction. But if there's a bar at (39,16), that's the problem.

Alternatively, if the boulder is at (37,15) (west of the agent), then pushing east would move it to (38,15), but the agent is already there. So that can't be. Maybe the boulder is at (38,16), south of the agent. Then pushing east would require the boulder to go to (39,16). If there's a bar there, that's blocking. The language observation says bars very near southeast, so (39,16) might be a bar, preventing the boulder from moving east into the fountain.

In that case, the agent needs to remove the bar or find a way around. But since the agent can't break bars (unless they have the right equipment), maybe they need to reposition the boulder first. For example, push the boulder south into a different spot, then east. But pushing south earlier failed, possibly because of another bar.

This is getting complicated. Let's recap:

- Agent is at (38,15).
- Boulder is adjacent southeast and south (so at (38,16) or (39,15) or (37,16)).
- Fountain is at eastsoutheast, which is likely (39,16) or similar.
- Bars are blocking the way east, so pushing the boulder east isn't working.
- Need to find a path for the boulder to the fountain without hitting bars.

Possible solution: Move the agent to the west of the boulder, then push east. If the boulder is at (38,16), the agent needs to get to (37,16) to push it east. But the agent is at (38,15). So move south to (38,16), then west to (37,16), then push east. However, moving south to (38,16) might hit a bar if there's one there.

Alternatively, move west to (37,15), then try pushing the boulder east from there. If the boulder is at (38,15), which is the agent's current position, that doesn't make sense. Maybe the boulder is at (38,16), south of the agent. So agent moves south to (38,16), then checks if they can push east. If bars are there, maybe they need to move the boulder south further, but that also might be blocked.

Another approach: Use the agent's inventory. They have a lance, maybe they can use it to push the boulder from a distance, but I think in MiniHack, you have to be adjacent to push. So that's probably not useful here.

Wait, the agent has a blessed +1 lance. Maybe they can wield it and use a different action, but I'm not sure. The available actions are movement and push, so probably not.

Given all this, the most plausible action is to try pushing the boulder in a different direction that isn't blocked by bars. Since pushing east isn't working, maybe push south or southeast. But earlier attempts to push south resulted in failure. Alternatively, move the agent to a position where they can push the boulder east without bars in the way.

Given the agent's current position and the boulder's location, perhaps moving west to (37,15) and then pushing the boulder east from there. If there are no bars west of the agent, that could work. The bars are adjacent north, northeast, and northwest, so west of the agent (37,15) might be clear.

So, the agent should move west to (37,15), then attempt to push the boulder east towards the fountain. This way, the boulder would move into (38,15), which is the agent's current position, but that's occupied. Wait, no. If the agent is at (37,15) and the boulder is at (38,15), pushing east would move the boulder to (39,15). But the fountain is at eastsoutheast, which is probably (39,16). So maybe pushing the boulder to (39,15) and then north or east to get it to the fountain.

Alternatively, if the boulder is at (38,16), and the agent moves to (37,16), then pushes east to (38,16) (which is where the boulder is), that doesn't make sense. Maybe the boulder is at (38,15), but the agent is also there. That can't be.

This is getting a bit confusing. Let's try to visualize the map based on the cursor position and the observations.

The agent is at (38,15). The boulder is adjacent southeast and south. So possible positions for the boulder:

- Southeast: (39,16)
- South: (38,16)
- Southwest: (37,16)

If the boulder is at (38,16) (south), then the agent is north of it. To push east, the boulder would need to move to (39,16), which is the fountain's direction. But there's a bar very near southeast, so (39,16) might be blocked. The language observation says bars very near north, northeast, etc., and specifically mentions bars very near southeast, southsoutheast, etc. So (39,16) is likely a bar, preventing the boulder from moving east into the fountain.

In that case, the agent needs to move the boulder around the bar. Maybe push it south further, but earlier attempts to push south failed. Alternatively, push it west or northwest around the bar.

If the boulder is at (38,16), pushing west would take it to (37,16). If there's no bar there, the agent could then push it north or east. But the agent is at (38,15), so moving south to (38,16), then west to (37,16), then pushing east to (38,16) (where the boulder is now?), which doesn't help.

This is tricky. Given the constraints, the best bet might be to keep trying to push the boulder in different directions, perhaps finding an angle where there's no bar blocking. Alternatively, the agent might need to move around to the side of the boulder and try again.

Another possibility: The agent is trying to push the boulder east into a dark area, which might not be the fountain. The fountain is at eastsoutheast, so the correct direction is southeast, not directly east. Maybe the agent needs to push the boulder southeast into the fountain.

To push southeast, the agent needs to be northwest of the boulder. If the boulder is at (38,16), the agent would need to be at (37,15) to push southeast. So the agent should move west to (37,15), then push southeast. This would move the boulder to (38,16), which is the same spot, but that doesn't help. Alternatively, if the boulder is at (39,16), pushing southwest from (38,15) would move it to (38,15), which is occupied.

I think the key issue is that the boulder is blocked by a bar to the east. The agent needs to either move the boulder around the bar or destroy the bar, but the agent can't destroy bars unless they have the right tools. Since the agent doesn't have a pickaxe or torch, they have to work around it.

Given all this, the most reasonable action is to continue trying to push the boulder in different directions, possibly south or west, to free it from the bar's blockage. Alternatively, move the agent to a position where they can push the boulder around the bar.

Given the previous attempts and the lack of progress, perhaps the agent should try pushing the boulder south towards the fountain, even if it failed before. Maybe there was a mistake in the earlier observations. Alternatively, move west to get a better angle.

In the end, the best action given the current information is to try pushing the boulder south again, in case there was an error in the previous observation, or to see if moving it south creates a path east later.

76,push east,"<reasoning>
Let's try to figure out what to do here. The goal is to push the boulder onto the fountain. From the observations, the boulder is near the east, and there's a fountain to the eastsoutheast. The problem is that the agent is getting stuck trying to push the boulder east, but the bars are blocking the way. So, maybe the path isn't clear?

First, I need to check the map layout. The cursor is at (38,15), and the boulder is adjacent southeast and south. The fountain is adjacent east. So the boulder is south or southeast of the agent. When the agent tries to push east, they must be hitting a bar or wall. The bars are adjacent north, northeast, and northwest, so the agent is near a wall or obstacle to the north, northeast, and northwest. That means the agent is in a position where moving north, northeast, or northwest isn't possible. 

The agent tried pushing east multiple times, but it's not working. Maybe the boulder isn't directly in front? Let me see the map. The agent's position is marked with @, and the boulder is {, which is southeast and south. So the boulder is to the right and perhaps below the agent. To push the boulder east, the agent would need to move towards it first. 

If the boulder is to the southeast or south, the agent should move south or southwest to get next to it. Then, when pushed, it would move towards the fountain. But the agent tried moving south before, but the message said ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" Wait, that's confusing. If the agent is trying to push south, but the boulder is southeast and south, maybe the agent isn't adjacent to the boulder when trying to push. 

Wait, the boulder is adjacent southeast and south. So when the agent is at (38,15), moving south would take them to (38,16). If the boulder is at (39,15) or (38,16), then pushing south would move it to (38,17) or (39,16). But the fountain is at eastsoutheast, which might be (39,16) or similar. 

The problem might be that the agent is not adjacent to the boulder. Let's check the cursor position and the boulder's location. The agent is at (38,15), and the boulder is adjacent southeast and south. So the boulder could be at (39,15) (southeast) or (38,16) (south). 

If the boulder is at (39,15), then to push it east, the agent needs to be at (38,15) and push east, but that's blocked by bars. If the boulder is at (38,16), then the agent would need to move south to (38,16) and then push east. But earlier attempts to move south resulted in the message ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" Hmm, maybe the agent isn't actually next to the boulder when trying to push. 

Alternatively, maybe the bars are blocking the path after pushing. The bars are adjacent north, northeast, and northwest, so the agent is surrounded on those sides. The only directions available might be east, south, or west. But west leads back to where they were, which also has bars. 

So the plan would be: move south to get next to the boulder, then push it east towards the fountain. But previous attempts to move south didn't work. Wait, in the observations after moving south, the message was ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" That implies that the agent was trying to move the boulder south, but perhaps the boulder isn't there anymore or the path is blocked. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to move in a different direction to position themselves correctly. Let's think again. The boulder is adjacent southeast and south. If the agent moves south once, they can get to (38,16), which might be where the boulder is. Then, pushing east from there would move the boulder to (39,16), which is towards the fountain at eastsoutheast. 

But the problem is that when the agent tries to push east, they get a message that they can't pass through bars. The bars are far north, but adjacent north, northeast, and northwest. So the agent is near a wall on the north, northeast, and northwest sides. Therefore, moving north, northeast, or northwest isn't possible. The only available directions are east, south, and west. 

Wait, the agent tried moving south and got the same message. Maybe the boulder is not in the right position. Looking at the map, the agent's position is at (38,15), and the boulder is southeast and south. The map shows some structures with '#' which are walls or obstacles. The bars are described as being in various directions, but the exact positions might be tricky. 

Another approach: since the agent can't push east because of bars, maybe they need to reposition. If the boulder is to the south, moving the agent south to get next to it, then pushing east. But the agent can't move south past the bars. Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to go around the bars. But the bars are adjacent north, so moving north isn't possible. 

Alternatively, check if the stairs up are at westsouthwest. The agent's position is (38,15), and stairs are at westsouthwest, which would be southwest direction. Maybe moving westsouthwest to the stairs, but that might not help. 

Alternatively, use the inventory. The agent has a +1 long sword, lance, ring mail, etc. But in Boxoban, you typically don't need to fight monsters; you just push boxes. So using weapons might not be necessary. 

Wait, the agent's previous actions were push east, which kept failing because of bars. Maybe the boulder is blocked by another obstacle. The language observation mentions a boulder adjacent southeast and south. So if the boulder is at (39,15) (southeast), pushing east would try to move it to (40,15), but there might be a bar there. The bars are very near north, northeast, etc., so maybe the path east from the boulder is blocked by bars. 

In that case, the agent needs to move the boulder around the bars. But how? If the boulder is blocked, the agent has to position it so that pushing it won't hit the bars. Maybe move the agent west to get a different angle, then push the boulder south or east. 

But the agent is already trying to push east and south, but it's not working. Let's see the latest observation: after moving west to (37,15), then east back to (38,15), and tried pushing south. Still bars blocking. 

Perhaps the solution is to move south to get next to the boulder, then push it east. But how to get past the bars? Maybe the bars are not in the way once the boulder is moved. Alternatively, the agent needs to find a path where the boulder can be pushed without hitting bars. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent should push the boulder south first, then east. If the boulder is at (38,16), pushing south would move it to (38,17), but then pushing east to (39,17), which might be towards the fountain. 

But the agent's previous attempts to move south resulted in the message about moving the boulder, but in vain. Maybe the boulder isn't actually there when the agent tries. 

Given the confusion in the map and observations, perhaps the best action is to continue trying to push the boulder in different directions, or move around to find a better position. Since pushing east keeps failing due to bars, maybe try pushing south instead. If the boulder is south, pushing it south could get it closer to the fountain. 

But the fountain is eastsoutheast, so moving the boulder east is better. However, the bars are blocking that path. Maybe the agent needs to find a way around the bars by moving west or south, but those directions are also blocked by bars or other obstacles. 

Another possibility: the agent is near a dead end with bars on multiple sides, and the only way is to push the boulder in a direction that's not blocked. If the boulder is adjacent southeast and south, perhaps pushing it south into a different position where it can then be pushed east. 

Alternatively, check if there's a way to move north around the bars, but the message says the agent can't pass through them. 

Given all this, the next logical step is to try pushing the boulder south again, even though it didn't work before, in case there was a misinterpretation of the boulder's position. Alternatively, move west to see if there's a clearer path, then try pushing the boulder east from there. 

But since the agent's previous attempts to move west didn't change the situation much, maybe the best bet is to keep trying to push the boulder in different directions, perhaps in a sequence that maneuvers it around the bars. 

Alternatively, since the agent is a knight, perhaps they can break through the bars, but that's unlikely in Boxoban. The game typically requires pushing boxes without breaking walls. 

So, the final decision is to keep trying to push the boulder east, but since that's blocked, maybe try moving south to get next to it and then push east from there. If moving south doesn't work, perhaps move west and then try pushing south or east. 

Given the latest observation, the agent is at (38,15), and the boulder is adjacent southeast and south. So moving south to (38,16) would place the agent next to the boulder (if it's there), then push east to (39,16), which is towards the fountain. 

Therefore, the next action should be to move south first, then push east. But since moving south previously resulted in the message about moving the boulder but in vain, maybe the boulder isn't in that position. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to move southwest. But the directions are only north, south, east, west. 

In conclusion, the most plausible action is to move south to get next to the boulder and then push east. So the next action should be 'south' followed by 'push east'. However, since the agent can't chain actions, each step must be a single action. So first, move south, then push east. But in the current state, moving south may not work, so perhaps try pushing east again, but in a different direction if possible.

The agent is stuck trying to push the boulder east but keeps getting errors because the bars are blocking the way. Let me look at the map and observations again.

The agent is at (38,15). The boulder is adjacent southeast and south. The fountain is to the east. The bars are all around the north, northeast, and northwest. The previous attempts to push east or south resulted in messages saying the boulder can't be moved, probably because there's a barrier behind it.

Wait, the boulder is near east. So maybe the agent is next to the boulder but there's something blocking the direction they're trying to push. The error message says ""You cannot pass through the bars,"" so the boulder is pushing against a bar or another obstacle. 

Looking at the map, the bars are adjacent north, northeast, and northwest. The boulder is adjacent southeast and south. So if the agent is trying to push east, the boulder's east side is probably against a bar or dark area. The dark areas are also mentioned in the language observations. Maybe there's a wall or bar behind the boulder when trying to push it east.

The alternative is to move around the boulder. Since the agent is at (38,15), moving west might take them to (37,15), which was previously a valid position. Once there, they can try pushing the boulder south or east again. But earlier attempts showed that moving south from (38,15) didn't work either because of the bars. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to move the boulder south first. But the boulder is adjacent southeast and south. If the agent moves south to (38,16), but looking at the map, there might be bars or other obstacles there. The map shows ########## in most rows, suggesting walls. 

Another idea: The agent needs to position themselves so that pushing the boulder east would clear the path. Since the fountain is east, maybe pushing the boulder east into the fountain. But the bars are blocking that direction. Perhaps the agent needs to move the boulder south towards the fountain, but the bars are in the way. 

Wait, the boulder is adjacent southeast and south. If the agent moves south to (38,16), maybe they can then push the boulder east. But the map's structure shows that row 16 might be a wall (######...), so moving south might not be possible. 

Alternatively, the agent should try pushing the boulder south first. If they can get the boulder past the bars, then they can move it east into the fountain. But the bars are adjacent north, northeast, and northwest, so pushing south might be blocked by those bars. 

Hmm. Maybe the agent needs to move west to (37,15) and then try pushing the boulder east. From (37,15), pushing east would move the boulder to (38,15), but that's where the agent is. Wait, no—the boulder is near east. If the agent is at (37,15), pushing the boulder east would move it to (38,15), which is the agent's current position. That's not possible because the agent can't be inside the boulder. 

So perhaps the correct approach is to move the agent west to (37,15), then push the boulder south into the fountain. But the fountain is eastsoutheast, so maybe pushing south into that area. However, the bars are very near southeast, so that might not work. 

Alternatively, the agent could try pushing the boulder south from its current position. The boulder is adjacent southeast and south. If the agent is next to it, pushing south might move it towards the fountain. But the bars adjacent north, northeast, and northwest might block that. 

Wait, the bars are adjacent north, northeast, and northwest of the agent, not the boulder. The boulder's position is near east, so pushing it east would be towards the fountain, but blocked by bars. 

I think the agent needs to find a way to navigate around the bars to push the boulder into the fountain. Since pushing east and south aren't working due to bars, maybe moving the agent south to a position where they can push the boulder east. But the map's structure has a lot of walls, so movement might be limited. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent should go to the stairs up near westsouthwest and go down a level, but the problem states it's level 1, and the goal is to push boulders onto fountains, so probably not necessary. 

Another thought: The agent has a lance, which might be useful for attacking, but in Boxoban, you need to push boulders, not attack. So using the lance isn't relevant here. 

The key is to get the boulder onto the fountain. The fountain is adjacent east, so pushing the boulder east would place it there. But the bars are blocking that. Therefore, the agent must remove the bars or find a path around them. However, in Boxoban, you can't remove bars; you can only push boulders. 

Wait, maybe the agent needs to move the boulder south first, then east. If the boulder is moved south past the bars, then east into the fountain. But the bars are adjacent north, northeast, and northwest of the agent, so moving the boulder south might require the agent to position themselves correctly. 

Alternatively, the agent could move west to (37,15), then push the boulder south. If the boulder is at (38,15), pushing south would move it to (38,16). If (38,16) is not blocked, that could work. Then from there, push east into the fountain. But the map shows that row 16 has ##########, which might be walls. 

Given the limited information and the fact that previous pushes didn't work, the safest bet is to keep trying to move the agent west to a position where they can push the boulder east without encountering bars. Alternatively, try a different direction. 

Since all previous attempts to push east or south resulted in bar errors, perhaps the agent should move west and then try pushing the boulder south. But how to confirm? 

Given the current position, the best action might be to move west to (37,15) and then attempt to push the boulder south towards the fountain. Alternatively, try pushing the boulder south from the current position. 

Wait, the boulder is adjacent southeast and south. If the agent is at (38,15), pushing the boulder south would require there to be space. But the bars are very near southeast, south, etc. Maybe the boulder is stuck against a bar to the south. 

In that case, the agent needs to move the boulder in a direction where there's no barrier. Since pushing east and south are blocked, maybe pushing west or north. But pushing west would move the boulder to (37,15), which might be clear. 

So, the agent could move west to (37,15), then push the boulder west into (36,15), freeing up space to push it east later. But the goal is to get it to the fountain east, so maybe pushing it south first. 

Alternatively, move the agent north to (38,14), but the bars are adjacent north, so that's not possible. 

Hmm. The agent is stuck in a loop trying to push east but failing. The correct action here might be to move west to a safe position and then adjust the boulder's position. 

So the next action should be to move west again to (37,15), then try pushing the boulder south or east from there. But since the previous west move didn't change anything, maybe the agent needs to find another approach. 

Another possibility: The boulder is very near westnorthwest. If the agent can move north to push that boulder out of the way, but there's a bar adjacent north. 

I think the best course is to continue moving west and then try pushing the boulder in a different direction. So the next action should be west again.

78,push south,"<reasoning>
Let's see where I am. The cursor is at (37, 15), and I'm facing a bunch of bars and dark areas. The main goal is to push the boulder onto the fountain. Looking at the map, there's a boulder near the east, and a fountain to the east southeast. The problem is that the boulder can't be pushed through the bars blocking the way.

Previously, I tried pushing east and south, but the bars are in the way. The last action was moving west back to (37, 15). Now, the boulder is adjacent southeast and south. So maybe I need to position myself to push the boulder south towards the fountain when there's a clear path.

Wait, the fountain is adjacent east. If I can push the boulder to the east, that would get it to the fountain. But the east direction is blocked by a bar. Alternatively, pushing it south might lead it closer. Let me check the observations again. The boulder is adjacent southeast and south. So the boulder is to the southeast and south of my current position. That means the boulder is at (38,16) or similar? Hmm, maybe I need to move around to get behind the boulder.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to move the boulder south first. If I can get to the south side of the boulder and push it. But the map shows bars adjacent north, northeast, and northwest. So moving north isn't possible. Maybe try pushing the boulder east, but the bars are in the way. Wait, the message says ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" when attempting to push east before. That's probably because there's a bar blocking the way behind the boulder.

So perhaps I need to find an alternative path. The stairs up are near westsouthwest, but I don't think that's relevant here. The key is to get the boulder to the fountain. Let me check the map again. The fountain is very near eastsoutheast, which might be at (39,16) or something. If the boulder is at (38,15), pushing it east would take it to (39,15), but there's a bar there. Alternatively, pushing it south to (38,16), then maybe east from there.

But how to get the boulder moving. Maybe I need to position myself to the north or west of the boulder. Wait, the boulder is adjacent southeast and south. So from my current position at (37,15), the boulder is to the southeast (38,16) and south (38,15). To push it south, I need to be to the north of the boulder. But I'm already north of it? If the boulder is at (38,15), then pushing south would require being at (38,14), but I'm at (37,15). So maybe I need to move east to (38,15) and then push south. But moving east is blocked by the boulder. Alternatively, move south to (37,16), but the bars are adjacent there.

Hmm, this is tricky. The bars are blocking straight paths. Maybe I need to find a way around the bars. Let's look at the bars very near north, northeast, etc. There's a lot of bars around, making it hard to maneuver. The boulder is stuck between the bars and the fountain. Maybe the solution is to push the boulder east first, but that's blocked. Alternatively, try pushing it in another direction.

Wait, the boulder is adjacent southeast and south. So if I move south to (37,16), but there's a bar there. Maybe I need to move west to (36,15) and then try pushing the boulder east. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, check if there's a clear path south from the boulder. If I can push the boulder south, then perhaps from there, push it east towards the fountain.

But how to get behind the boulder. Let me think. If the boulder is at (38,15), then to push it south, I need to be at (38,14). But I'm at (37,15). So I need to move east to (38,15), which is where the boulder is. That's not possible. Wait, maybe the boulder is at (38,16). If I'm at (37,15), moving east to (38,15) would be next to the boulder. Then, pushing the boulder east would be to (39,15), but there's a bar there. So that doesn't work.

Alternatively, if the boulder is at (38,15), pushing it south to (38,16), then from there, maybe push east. But again, the bars are in the way. This is really challenging. Maybe I need to find a different approach. Perhaps using the stairs up isn't helpful here. The main goal is to get the boulder to the fountain. The fountain is adjacent east, so getting the boulder to (39,15) would solve it. But how?

Wait, the boulder is very near westnorthwest. Maybe there's another boulder? No, the observation says ""boulder very near westnorthwest"" and ""boulder adjacent southeast and south"". So two boulders? One near westnorthwest and another near southeast and south. Wait, no, maybe it's the same boulder. The descriptions might be conflicting. Let me parse the language observation again.

""boulder very near westnorthwest"" and ""boulder adjacent southeast and south"". That suggests the boulder is in two places, which isn't possible. Maybe it's a typo. So the main boulder is adjacent southeast and south. So the boulder is at (38,16) and (38,15). Or maybe it's one boulder that's in both positions. That doesn't make sense. Perhaps the description is that the boulder is near southeast and south of the agent's current position.

Assuming the boulder is southeast (38,16) and south (38,15), then to push it south, I need to be at (38,15) and push it to (38,16). But the agent is at (37,15). So move east to (38,15), which is the position of the boulder. Then, push south. But can't move into the boulder. So instead, from (37,15), move south to (37,16), but there's a bar. Alternatively, move east to (38,15), then push south to (38,16). But is that path clear?

The bars very near north, northeast, etc. include southsoutheast, which might be blocking the path. This is getting complicated. Maybe the best move is to try pushing the boulder south again, even if it failed before, in case the environment changed. Or perhaps move around to the westnorthwest boulder and manipulate that, but the main boulder is the one near the fountain.

Alternatively, check if the fountain is at a different location. The fountain is very near eastsoutheast, which would be (39,16) or similar. If the boulder can be moved there, that's the solution. But the bars are blocking the direct path. Maybe the agent needs to find a way around the bars to push the boulder eastward around them.

Another idea: Since the agent has a lance, maybe using a ranged attack, but the goal is to push the boulder, not attack. So probably not relevant. The inventory has a long sword and a lance, but pushing is the key.

Given all this, the best action might be to keep trying to push the boulder south, hoping that the previous attempts didn't actually move it due to some obstacle that's now cleared. Or perhaps move to a different position to get a clear path. Alternatively, move west to get around the bars and try pushing the boulder from another angle.

Wait, the bars adjacent north, northeast, and northwest. So from the agent's current position (37,15), moving north is blocked by bars. Moving northeast would be (38,16), which is where the boulder might be. Moving northwest would be (36,14), which is blocked by bars. So the agent is somewhat surrounded by bars except east and south.

If the agent moves east to (38,15), which is next to the boulder, then tries to push it south to (38,16). If that's possible, then maybe from there, push east. But need to check if (38,16) is clear. The bars very near include southsoutheast, which could be at (39,17), so not directly blocking (38,16). Maybe it's possible.

So the plan is: move east to (38,15), then push south to (38,16). If successful, then from there push east towards the fountain. Let's try that.

Let's try to figure this out. The agent is stuck trying to push a boulder east but keeps getting an error because the path is blocked by bars. The observations show that there's a boulder near the east, and a fountain nearby. The agent's current position is (x=37, y=15) after moving west from (38,15). The map shows bars in various directions, making movement tricky.

The goal is to push the boulder onto the fountain. The boulder is adjacent to the southeast and northwest, but the fountain is to the east. The problem is the bars blocking the way. The agent needs to find a way around the bars to position the boulder correctly.

Looking at the map, the boulder is at (38,15) and the fountain is to the east at (38,16) maybe? But the agent is at (37,15). To push the boulder east, the agent needs to be behind it. However, there's a bar adjacent to the boulder's northeast and north, so moving directly north or northeast isn't possible. 

The agent tried pushing east multiple times but failed. Maybe the boulder is stuck against a bar. The agent needs to move around the boulder to get to a position where they can push it in the right direction. For example, moving south to get under the boulder and then push it east. But the map shows bars adjacent north, northeast, and northwest, so moving south might be possible if there's no bar there.

Wait, the language observation says bars adjacent north, northeast, and northwest of the agent. So moving south from (37,15) would take the agent to (37,16). Is that clear? The map doesn't show any bars there, so maybe that's a viable path. Once the agent moves south, they can then move east towards the boulder and try pushing it again. Alternatively, the agent could move west to get a better angle, but that might not help. 

Another option is to check if there are any other obstacles. The dark areas might be walls or other structures, but the main issue is the bars. The agent needs to navigate around the bars to get behind the boulder. Maybe moving south first, then east, then pushing the boulder east when there's no obstacle in front. 

So the plan is: move south to avoid the bars, then move east towards the boulder, and then push it east towards the fountain. The agent should avoid repeating the same failed actions and instead find a new path. Let's try moving south now.

Let's try to figure out what the agent should do next. The goal is to push the boulders onto the fountains. Looking at the observations, the agent is at position (37, 16). There's a boulder adjacent to the southeast and southwest. The fountain is very near eastnortheast, so maybe one of the boulders needs to be moved there.

Previously, the agent tried pushing east but encountered bars. The bars are blocking the way, so the agent can't go straight through. The boulder is to the east, but pushing it east is blocked by bars. Maybe the agent needs to move around to a position where they can push the boulder in a different direction.

Looking at the map, the current position has a boulder to the southeast (south of the agent's current position maybe?). The fountain is eastnortheast, so perhaps moving the boulder south or west could help get it closer. But the agent's current position is (37,16), and the boulder is adjacent southeast and southwest. If the boulder is to the south, pushing it south might move it towards the fountain.

The agent tried moving south before, but the last action was ""south"" and the cursor is now at (37,16). The map shows a boulder very near east and northnorthwest. Maybe the boulder is to the east, but the bars are blocking the path. The agent needs to find a way to push the boulder around the bars.

Alternatively, maybe the agent should move west to get a better angle. If the boulder is to the east, pushing it east is blocked by bars, but pushing it north or south might be possible. The agent's current position is (37,16). If the boulder is to the east (position 38,16), pushing it north to (38,15) might be possible if there's no obstacle. However, the observation mentions bars adjacent southeast, south, and southwest. So moving south from here could lead to pushing the boulder south.

Wait, the boulder adjacent southeast and southwest. So if the agent is at (37,16), southeast would be (38,17), and southwest would be (38,15). The fountain is eastnortheast, which might be (39,17) or similar. To get the boulder to the fountain, perhaps pushing it east from (38,16) to (39,16), but that's blocked by bars. So maybe pushing it south from (38,16) to (38,17), where the fountain is.

But how to get to that position. The agent is at (37,16). Maybe move east to 38,16, then push the boulder south to 38,17. But the bars are adjacent southeast, south, and southwest. So moving east to 38,16 might be possible if there's no bar there. The observation says bars adjacent southeast, south, and southwest of the agent's current position. So moving east to (38,16) would be adjacent to the boulder, which is southeast. Wait, maybe the boulder is at (38,16), and pushing it south would move it to (38,17), which is near the fountain.

So the plan is: move east to 38,16, then push south to 38,17. That would place the boulder on the fountain. The agent needs to navigate past the bars. Since moving north is blocked by bars, the agent should move east towards the boulder. Let's check the map. The current cell at (37,16) has a boulder very near east and northnorthwest. So the boulder is likely at (38,16). Moving east to 38,16, then push south to 38,17. That should work if there's no obstacle there. The fountain is very near eastnortheast, which would be (39,17) or so. If the boulder is pushed to (38,17), that's closer to the fountain.

Alternatively, maybe the agent should move south first to 37,17, then east. But the bars are adjacent south, so moving south might be possible. Wait, the bars adjacent are south, southeast, and southwest. So moving south from (37,16) to (37,17) is allowed if there's no bar there. The observation says bars adjacent south, so perhaps the cell south is blocked. Therefore, the agent can't move south directly. So the best path is to move east to (38,16), then push south.

So the actions would be: east, then push south. But the agent needs to execute these step by step. The previous attempts to push east were invalid because of bars, but maybe now that the agent is at (37,16), moving east to (38,16) is possible, and then pushing south.

Checking the current observation: the boulder is very near east and northnorthwest. So at (38,16), pushing south to (38,17) would move it towards the fountain. The fountain is eastnortheast, which is probably (39,17) or (38,17) if that's the direction. Assuming the fountain is at (38,17), pushing the boulder there would solve the problem.

Therefore, the next action should be to move east to get next to the boulder, then push south. But first, check if moving east is possible. The bars are adjacent southeast, south, and southwest of the agent's current position (37,16). Moving east to (38,16) would place the agent next to the boulder. Since the boulder is there, the agent can push it south. So the actions would be: east, then push south.

But the agent's last action was south, moving to (37,16). Now, the agent needs to move east. The map shows at (38,16) there's a boulder. So moving east is possible, and then pushing south. The agent hasn't tried pushing south from (38,16) yet. So the next action should be east to reach the boulder, then push south.

I need to figure out the next move in this Boxoban-like game. The goal is to push the boulders onto the fountains. Let me start by looking at the current observation.

The agent is at position (37, 16). The map shows there's a boulder very near the east and northnorthwest. The fountains are near eastnortheast and east. The stairs up are very near west, which might be a way out once the level is done, but right now the priority is pushing the boulders.

Looking at the language observations, the boulder adjacent to the southeast, south, and southwest. Wait, the cursor is at (37,16), and the map shows '#<.@``{.{#' on the line y=15. Wait, maybe I need to check the map again.

Wait, the map lines are a bit confusing. The agent is at (37,15) initially, but after moving south, they are at (37,16). The map's y-axis might be inverted, so lower y is north. Let me parse the map again.

In the latest map, after moving south to (37,16), the line for y=16 is '#....{..`#' and y=15 is '#<.@``{.{#'. The agent's position is at (37,16), so the '@' is at x=37, y=16. The boulder is adjacent to the east, as per the message when trying to push east. The message says ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain,"" which might mean that the boulder is there but can't be moved because there's something blocking it. Wait, the message says ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" Maybe the agent tried to push it east but there's an obstacle behind it. Let me check the map.

Looking at the map at (37,16), the character to the east (x=38, y=16) is '{', which might be a wall or an obstacle. So the boulder is at (38,16), and the agent is trying to push it east to (39,16), but there's a '{' blocking the way. So the boulder can't be pushed in that direction because there's an obstacle behind it.

The fountains are near eastnortheast and east. The east fountain is very near, so maybe the boulder needs to be pushed to that fountain. But the boulder is currently at (38,16), and the east direction is blocked by a wall. So perhaps the agent needs to move around to a different position to push the boulder towards the fountain.

Looking at the adjacency, the boulder is adjacent to the east, which is blocked. So the agent needs to move north or south to get a better angle. Maybe moving west to get next to the boulder and try pushing it north or south. Alternatively, check if there's a way to move the boulder towards the fountain by navigating around.

The stairs up are near westsouthwest, which is probably at (34,13) or similar, but maybe not immediately relevant. The priority is pushing the boulder onto the fountain. The fountain very near eastnortheast would be at a position like (39,14) or similar. The boulder is at (38,16), so moving it north to (38,15) might get it closer to the fountain at (39,14). But the agent is at (37,16), so moving north to (37,15), then west to (36,15), then south to (36,16), and then see if they can push the boulder east?

Alternatively, the agent is at (37,16). If they move west to (36,16), then south to (36,17), maybe they can find a path to push the boulder. Alternatively, check if there's a way to move the boulder south. The boulder is at (38,16), so pushing it south to (38,17) if possible. But the map's y=17 line isn't shown, but the dark areas and bars might indicate obstacles.

Alternatively, since the fountain is near east, maybe pushing the boulder east into the fountain. But the obstacle is the '{' at (39,16). Maybe that's a wall, so the boulder can't go beyond that. Therefore, the boulder needs to be placed adjacent to the fountain but within the grid.

Another approach: Look for the fountain positions. The fountain very near eastnortheast would be at a position like (39,14) or (38,15). The boulder is at (38,16). If the agent can move north to (38,15), then maybe push the boulder north to (38,14), which is closer to the fountain. But need to check if that's possible.

The agent is currently at (37,16). To get to (38,15), they need to move north to (37,15), then east to (38,15). Then, if they can push the boulder north from (38,16) to (38,15), but that position might be occupied by the agent or another obstacle. Wait, the agent is moving to (38,15), then maybe push the boulder from (38,16) north to (38,15). But if the agent is at (38,15), they can't push the boulder north because they are in the way. So perhaps the agent needs to move aside.

Alternatively, the agent could move west to (36,16), then north to (36,15), then east to (37,15), then south to (37,16), and try pushing the boulder east again. But that might not help.

Wait, the latest message says that when the agent tried to push east, they couldn't because the boulder couldn't move. So the boulder is at (38,16), and pushing east would require the space at (39,16) to be free. But there's a '{' there, which is a wall or an obstacle. So the boulder is stuck there.

The agent needs to find another way to move the boulder. Maybe push it north or south. Let's check the map again. At (38,16), north would be (38,15). Is that space free? The agent is at (37,16), so moving north to (37,15), then east to (38,15), which is the position north of the boulder. Then, the agent can push the boulder north from (38,16) to (38,15). But if (38,15) is free, then that's possible.

Looking at the map line for y=15: '#<.@``{.{#'. The agent is at (37,15) here. The character at (38,15) is '`', which might be a floor or walkable space. So yes, the agent can move to (38,15), then push the boulder north to (38,14).

Once the boulder is at (38,14), then the agent can move it further north towards the fountain. The fountain is near eastnortheast, which might be at (39,14). So pushing the boulder from (38,14) east to (39,14) would place it on the fountain.

So the steps would be:

1. Move the agent from (37,16) north to (37,15).
2. Move east to (38,15).
3. Push the boulder north from (38,16) to (38,15).
4. Then, push it east to (39,14) if that's the fountain.

But need to check if the path is clear. Let's verify:

From (38,15), pushing the boulder north to (38,14). The map's y=14 line isn't shown, but assuming it's walkable if there's no obstacle mentioned. The fountain is very near eastnortheast, so (39,14) is likely a fountain.

Alternatively, maybe the agent should first move west to get a better angle. But given the current position, moving north and then east seems feasible.

So the next action should be to move north to (37,15), then east to (38,15), then push the boulder north. But since the user is asking for the next action based on the latest observation, which is after moving south to (37,16) and getting the message that pushing east didn't work, the agent is now at (37,16).

The immediate next step is to try a different direction. Since pushing east didn't work, perhaps try moving north to (37,15) and then see if they can get to the boulder's position.

So the first action would be to move north from (37,16) to (37,15).

Let's try to figure out what action to take here. The agent is in a Boxoban-like environment, trying to push boulders onto fountains. Let's look at the current observation.

The cursor is at (37,15). The map shows there's a boulder very near eastsoutheast and another at (38,15). The fountain is adjacent east, so maybe the boulder at (38,15) is near the fountain. The agent is currently at (37,15) and can move around.

The previous actions tried pushing east and south but hit bars. The latest attempt to move east resulted in a message saying the boulder couldn't be moved, but that might be because the boulder is already in a position where pushing it further is blocked by bars or other obstacles.

Looking at the map, the agent is at position 37,15. To the east (38,15) is a boulder (`{`), and a fountain (`<`) is adjacent to the east. So the goal is to push the boulder from (38,15) to the fountain at (39,15). But the agent is at 37,15, so they need to move east to get next to the boulder.

Wait, the agent was at 38,15 earlier, then moved west to 37,15. Now, to push the boulder east, the agent needs to be adjacent to it. So from 37,15, moving east to 38,15 would place the agent next to the boulder. Then, pushing east would move the boulder to 39,15, which is the fountain. That seems like the correct approach.

But in the previous steps, when the agent tried to push east from (38,15), they got a message saying they couldn't pass through bars. Wait, looking back at the observations, the bars are adjacent north, northeast, and northwest at (38,15). So if the agent is at (38,15) and tries to push the boulder east to (39,15), they need to check if there's a barrier there. The map shows that at (39,15), there's a fountain (`<`), which is a valid target for pushing. However, the bars adjacent to (38,15) are north, northeast, and northwest, not east. So maybe the bars are in other directions.

Wait, the language observation says ""bars adjacent north, northeast, and northwest"" at the agent's current position (37,15). So when moving east to 38,15, the bars adjacent there might be different. The boulder at 38,15 is very near westnorthwest, which might be the bars. So pushing the boulder east from 38,15 to 39,15 should be possible if there's no barrier there.

The key is to get the agent to stand next to the boulder at 38,15 so they can push it east towards the fountain at 39,15. Since the agent is currently at 37,15, moving east once will get them next to the boulder. Then, pushing east should work.

So the next action should be to move east to 38,15, then push east. But in the previous attempts, moving east from 38,15 resulted in a message about bars. Maybe the bars are in the way when pushing. Let me check the map again. The map shows at position 38,15 there's a boulder (`{`), and the agent is at 37,15. The fountain is at 39,15 (as indicated by `<` at that position). The bars adjacent to 38,15 might be in other directions. The latest language observation says ""bars adjacent north and northeast"" at the agent's current position (37,15), so when moving east to 38,15, the bars there might not block the path.

Alternatively, maybe the bars are blocking the path beyond the boulder. So pushing the boulder east from 38,15 to 39,15 is possible if there's no barrier there. The fountain is at 39,15, so that's the target. Therefore, the correct action is to move east to get next to the boulder and then push east.

But the agent needs to be in position. Since the agent is currently at 37,15, moving east once will place them at 38,15, adjacent to the boulder. Then push east. However, in the previous steps, when the agent tried to push east from 38,15, they got an error. Maybe because the bars are in the way beyond the boulder. Let me check the latest language observation.

The latest observation after moving south to (37,16) and then back north to (37,15) shows that at (37,15), the bars adjacent are north and northeast. The boulder is at 38,15, very near westnorthwest. So when the agent is at 37,15, moving east to 38,15, the boulder is there. Then pushing east from 38,15 should go to 39,15, which is the fountain. There's no mention of bars at 39,15, only that the fountain is there. So this should work.

Therefore, the next actions are: move east to 38,15, then push east to 39,15. But since the agent can only take one action at a time, first move east, then push east. However, the system might not allow consecutive actions without observation, but given the history, the agent needs to choose the next action based on the current state.

So the immediate next action is to move east to get next to the boulder. Then, the following action would be to push east. But since the user is asking for the next action based on the current observation, which is after moving north back to (37,15), the correct action is to move east.

",-0.001,False
83,push south,"<reasoning>
Let's see where I am. I'm in Boxoban, trying to push a boulder onto a fountain. The map has a lot of bars, which I can't pass through. The boulders are near east and westnorthwest, and there's a fountain to the east.

Looking at the map, my current position is (38,15). The boulder I can see is adjacent to southeast and south. The fountain is adjacent to east. So maybe I need to move the boulder east towards the fountain.

Earlier attempts to push south or east didn't work because I hit bars. Wait, after moving east once, the boulder was still there, but then when I pushed east again, I got a message saying I couldn't move it. Maybe the boulder is blocked by another obstacle or bars.

I need to check if there's a path to push the boulder. The bars are adjacent north, northeast, and northwest. If I can get to the side of the boulder where there's no obstacle, I can push it. Since the boulder is adjacent to southeast and south, maybe pushing it south would work if there's a clear path.

But the bars are very near in various directions. Let me look at the cursor position again. If I'm at (38,15) and the boulder is adjacent southeast and south, that means the boulder is at (39,15) or (38,16). Wait, the boulder adjacent southeast would be (39,16) or something? Maybe I need to clarify the map layout.

Alternatively, since pushing east didn't work before, maybe I need to try a different direction. The boulder is near east, so perhaps pushing it south into the fountain. But there's a dark area to the south, so maybe that's blocked. Wait, the fountain is very near eastsoutheast, which is probably (39,16). If I can push the boulder from the east side to the southeast, that would reach the fountain.

But how to get around the bars. The bars adjacent north, northeast, northwest. So if I'm trying to push the boulder south, maybe I need to position myself west of it. But my current position is east of the boulder. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I should move north to find a better position. But the bars are blocking that. Wait, the message said ""You cannot pass through the bars,"" so north is blocked. Maybe I need to go west, then south to get around the bars and get behind the boulder.

But when I tried moving west before, I ended up back at (38,15). Let me check the previous steps. After pushing south multiple times and getting errors, I moved west, then tried pushing again. Maybe the boulder is stuck between bars.

Wait, the boulder very near westnorthwest is probably at (37,14) or similar. Maybe that's another boulder. The main one I'm concerned with is the one near east, adjacent southeast and south. So maybe pushing it south into the fountain, but there's a bar in the way. The bars very near north, northeast, etc., might be blocking the path.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to move the boulder east first, but the bars are blocking that direction. So maybe I need to find a way to move around the bars. For example, moving west to a spot where there are no bars, then pushing the boulder east.

But the dark areas might be pits or other obstacles. I have to be careful not to fall. Since the stairs are up near westsouthwest, maybe that's an exit, but I need to solve the puzzle first.

Another approach: check the inventory. I have a long sword, lance, ring mail, shield, etc. But I don't think inventory items are relevant here since it's a pushing puzzle. The key is to navigate and push the boulder using movement.

So, current position (38,15). The boulder is at (39,15) (east adjacent). To push it east, I need to be next to it and push in the direction where there's no obstacle. But the bars are adjacent northeast and northwest, so pushing east might be possible if there's no bar behind the boulder.

Wait, the boulder's position: if I'm at (38,15) and the boulder is at (39,15), then pushing east would require that the space east of the boulder (40,15) is clear. But according to the observations, there's a dark area near southeast, south, etc. Maybe (40,15) is a dark area, which could be a pit or blocked. So pushing the boulder east might be dangerous or impossible.

Alternatively, pushing the boulder south. If the boulder is at (39,15), pushing south would take it to (39,16). The fountain is at eastsoutheast, which is perhaps (40,16) or similar. But need to check if that path is clear.

Looking at the bars' positions: very near north, northeast, southeast, etc. The bars adjacent to the boulder's position might be south. If I push the boulder south into (39,16), is that space clear? The dark area near southeast and south could mean that (39,16) is a dark area, possibly blocked. So pushing south might not work.

Hmm. Maybe I need to move the boulder west. But the boulder is near east, so west of it would be (38,15), which is where I am. So pushing west would move it to (38,15), but that's where I'm standing, which isn't allowed. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, moving north to get a better angle, but north is blocked by bars. So that's not an option.

Wait, the boulder is adjacent southeast and south. So maybe it's at (38,16) or (39,16). If it's at (38,16), pushing south would take it to (38,17), but I don't know if that's clear. Alternatively, if it's at (39,16), pushing south to (39,17).

But without knowing the exact map layout, it's tricky. The key is to find a direction where the boulder can be pushed into the fountain without hitting bars or obstacles.

Given that the fountain is adjacent east, perhaps pushing the boulder east first, then south. But east is blocked by bars. Alternatively, move around to the side of the boulder where there's no obstacle.

Since I'm at (38,15), and the boulder is near east (39,15), maybe I can move south to (38,16) and try pushing the boulder from there. Let's see if that's possible.

Moving south to (38,16). Then the boulder is at (39,15). To push it east from there, I would need to be at (39,15) and push east. But I'm at (38,16). Maybe I can move east to (39,16) and then push the boulder east from there.

But the problem is the bars blocking movement. The bars adjacent north, northeast, and northwest of my current position. If I move south to (38,16), what's there? The bars very near north, etc., but maybe south is clear. Let me check the language observation.

The bars very near north, northnortheast, northeast, southeast, southsoutheast, south, southsouthwest, southwest, and northnorthwest. So at (38,16), the bars are very near in various directions. So moving south might still be blocked.

Alternatively, perhaps the best action is to keep trying to push the boulder in valid directions. Since previous attempts to push south or east didn't work, maybe trying a different direction.

Wait, the boulder is adjacent southeast and south. If I can get to the southeast side of the boulder, maybe I can push it south into the fountain. To do that, I would need to move to (39,16) and then push south.

But getting to (39,16) might be blocked by bars. The bars very near southeast and south. So maybe it's possible.

Alternatively, since the fountain is adjacent east, perhaps pushing the boulder east into the fountain directly. But the boulder is at (39,15), so pushing east would take it to (40,15). If that's a fountain, then great. But the observation says the fountain is very near eastsoutheast, which is probably (40,16). So (40,15) might be a dark area.

This is getting complicated. Maybe the best action is to try pushing the boulder in a direction where there's no obstacle mentioned. For example, if the boulder is at (39,15), pushing south to (39,16) if that's clear. But according to the observations, there are bars very near in various directions, so it's risky.

Alternatively, move west to (37,15) and then try pushing the boulder east from there. If I'm at (37,15), pushing the boulder east to (38,15) where I am now, but that's occupied. So that doesn't work.

Hmm. Maybe I need to look for another boulder. There's another one very near westnorthwest, which is at (37,14) perhaps. But the main one is the one near east.

Given the previous attempts and the lack of progress, perhaps the best course is to try a different direction. Let's try pushing the boulder south again, even if it seems blocked, maybe the observation is outdated.

Wait, the latest observation after moving south to (37,16) showed that the boulder is adjacent east. So the boulder is still near east. Maybe I need to move closer to it.

Alternatively, maybe I should pick up an item, but the inventory doesn't seem to have anything useful for pushing boulders. So back to movement.

Another idea: since the stairs are up near westsouthwest, maybe the solution requires getting the boulder to the fountain and then using the stairs, but that's probably not necessary. The goal is just to push the boulder onto the fountain.

Given all this, the most plausible action is to keep trying to push the boulder in a valid direction. The last valid direction that might work is south. So I'll try pushing south again.

84,push east,"<reasoning>
Let me try to figure out what to do next in this Boxoban game. The goal is to push the boulders onto the fountains. Looking at the current observation, the agent is at position (38, 15). The map shows a couple of boulders nearby. There's a boulder adjacent to the southeast and south. The fountains are to the east and eastsoutheast.

The previous attempts to push the boulder south kept getting blocked by bars, so that's not working. The agent tried moving around but kept hitting bars. The latest action was ""push south"" which was invalid because of the bars in the way. The agent is now back at (38, 15) facing the same obstacles.

Looking at the map, the boulder is to the southeast and south. The fountain is adjacent to the east, so maybe the agent needs to move towards the east to reach the fountain. But there's a boulder near east, which might be the one that needs to be pushed. The agent tried pushing east before but failed, maybe because the boulder is blocked by another obstacle or another boulder.

Wait, the language observation says ""boulder adjacent southeast and south"". So the boulder is south and southeast of the agent. The agent is at (38,15). If the boulder is south, then pushing it south would take it towards (38,16), but there's a bar adjacent south. The bars are blocking that path. Alternatively, pushing the boulder east might move it towards the fountain at eastsoutheast.

But when the agent tried pushing east before, the message was ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" So maybe the boulder is blocked by another object. Looking at the map, maybe there's a wall or another boulder in the way. The map shows some structures like '##########' which are probably walls or bars.

Another approach: since the agent is at (38,15), maybe move east to (39,15) and then try pushing the boulder southeast towards the fountain. But the agent tried moving east earlier and then pushing, which didn't work. Maybe the boulder is stuck between bars or another obstacle.

Alternatively, check if there's a way to maneuver around the boulder. The agent could move west to (37,15) and then try pushing the boulder south or east. But the boulder is adjacent southeast and south, so moving west might not help. 

Wait, the boulder is adjacent southeast and south. So if the agent is at (38,15), the boulder could be at (39,15) (southeast?) or (38,16) (south). But the bars are adjacent north, northeast, and northwest of the agent. So moving north is blocked by bars. 

The fountains are at east and eastsoutheast. The closest fountain is east, which is probably at (39,16) or similar. The boulder near east might need to be pushed towards that fountain. But the agent can't push it east directly because of the bars. 

Maybe the agent needs to find a path to move the boulder around the bars. For example, push the boulder south first if possible, but the bars are blocking that. Alternatively, move the agent east to get a better position. But previous attempts to push east resulted in failure. 

Alternatively, check the inventory. The agent has a long sword and a lance, but those aren't useful for pushing boulders. The goal is still to use the boulders. Maybe the agent needs to find a way to navigate around the bars to reposition the boulder. 

Another thought: the agent is at (38,15). The boulder is adjacent southeast and south. If the boulder is to the southeast (39,16), then pushing it towards eastsoutheast (maybe (40,17)) could get it to the fountain. But how to get there without hitting bars. 

Looking at the map, there are a lot of '###' which are probably walls. The agent is surrounded by bars on the north, northeast, and northwest. So movement north is blocked. The only free directions are east, south, and west, but south is blocked by bars. 

Wait, the latest observation says bars adjacent north, northeast, and northwest. So the agent can't move north. The agent is at (38,15). To the east is (39,15), which might be a boulder or a free space. The message when pushing east before said the boulder couldn't be moved, but maybe the boulder is blocked by another obstacle. 

Alternatively, maybe the boulder is stuck between the agent and the bars. The agent needs to move the boulder in a direction that is not blocked by bars. For example, if the boulder is to the south, pushing it east might work if there's a path. 

But given the map's structure, it's possible that the boulder is surrounded by bars and other obstacles, making it impossible to move. In that case, the agent might need to find another boulder or reposition themselves. 

Wait, the language observation mentions ""boulder very near westnorthwest"". So there's another boulder at (37,14) or nearby. Maybe the agent should go there and try pushing that one. 

The agent's current position is (38,15). Moving west to (37,15) and then north or south might reach the other boulder. But the bars are adjacent north, northeast, and northwest, so moving north from (37,15) is blocked. 

Alternatively, move west to (37,15), then south to (37,16), and see if there's a path to push the boulder westnorthwest. But this is getting complicated. 

Another approach: since the agent keeps hitting bars, maybe try to find a path around them. The agent is at (38,15). South is blocked by bars. East is partially blocked by a boulder. West might be possible. Move west to (37,15), then check if pushing the boulder there is possible. 

If the agent is at (37,15), the boulder to the southeast and south would be at (38,16) or (37,16). Pushing that boulder east might get it towards the fountain. 

But the agent's previous attempts to push east resulted in failure, which might mean the boulder is blocked by another object. 

Alternatively, check if the boulder adjacent southeast is at (39,16). Pushing it south to (39,17) might free up space. But again, bars might be in the way. 

This is a bit tricky. Given the constraints, the best action might be to try moving the boulder in a direction that's not blocked by bars. Since the agent can't go north, maybe try pushing the boulder east again, but ensure there's a clear path. 

Wait, the latest observation says ""boulder adjacent southeast and south"". So the boulder is to the southeast (39,16) and south (38,16). If the agent is at (38,15), pushing the boulder at (38,16) south would take it to (38,17), but there's a bar very near south. So that's blocked. 

Pushing the boulder at (39,16) east would take it to (40,16), which might be a valid direction if there's no obstacle. But the language observation doesn't mention bars in that direction, so maybe it's possible. 

The agent should try pushing the boulder east towards the fountain. Even if it fails, it's worth a try. Alternatively, move east first to get a better angle. 

Given the previous failures, maybe the agent needs to reposition. Move east to (39,15), then push the boulder southeast. But the bars are still a problem. 

Alternatively, the agent should look for a different boulder. The one at westnorthwest (37,14) might be movable. Move west to (37,15), then north to (37,14) if possible, but north is blocked by bars. 

Hmm. This is getting repetitive. The agent is stuck trying to push the boulder south but keeps hitting bars. The solution might be to find a different path or adjust the agent's position. 

Considering all this, the next logical action is to try pushing the boulder east again, even though it failed before. Maybe there was a temporary obstacle or the agent needs to be in a specific position. Alternatively, move east first and then push. 

But the previous attempt to push east directly didn't work. So perhaps the agent should move east to (39,15) and then try pushing the boulder southeast or east again. 

In the last valid action, the agent was at (38,15) and tried pushing south, which failed. Now, the best bet is to try a different direction. Since moving north is blocked, south is blocked by bars, west might help. 

Another idea: the agent could move west to (37,15) and then try pushing the boulder south or east. If the boulder is at (38,16), pushing it west to (37,16) might clear the path. 

But the agent doesn't know the exact positions of the boulders. Based on the language observation, the boulders are adjacent southeast and south. So the agent should check those positions. 

In conclusion, the best action is to try pushing the boulder east again, or move east first to get a better angle. However, given the previous failure, perhaps moving east and then trying a different direction would be better. 

So the chosen action is to move east to (39,15) and then attempt to push the boulder. But since the agent already tried that and it failed, maybe the next step is to try pushing the boulder in another direction. 

Alternatively, since the fountain is adjacent east, maybe the agent should push the boulder directly east towards it. Even if the path is blocked, maybe there's a way around. 

Given the constraints and the need to avoid repeating the same actions, the next action should be to push the boulder east, perhaps with a different approach. 

Wait, the agent's previous attempts to push east resulted in the message ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" That usually means the boulder is blocked by another object or a wall. So maybe the boulder is stuck between the agent and a bar or another boulder. 

In that case, the agent needs to move the boulder in a different direction. For example, if the boulder is to the south, push it west or east. But west is blocked by bars. 

Alternatively, the agent could move south around the boulder, but that's blocked by bars. 

This is quite challenging. Given that the agent keeps hitting bars, maybe the solution is to find a way to move the boulder around the bars. For example, if the boulder is to the south, push it east until it's past the bars, then north to the fountain. 

But without knowing the exact layout, it's hard to say. The best bet is to try pushing the boulder in a direction that's not blocked by bars. Given the bars are to the north, northeast, and northwest, the agent can't push north. Pushing east or south might be the only options, but south is blocked by bars. 

So the only viable option is to push the boulder east. Even if it fails, maybe the agent needs to keep trying. 

Therefore, the chosen action is to push the boulder east again.

",-0.001,False
85,east,"<reasoning>
Let's try to figure out what the agent should do next. The goal is to push the boulders onto the fountains. Looking at the current observation, the boulder is adjacent to the southwest and southeast. The agent is currently at position (38, 15), and the fountain is adjacent to the southeast.

The problem is that the agent keeps trying to push the boulder south or east, but it's getting blocked by bars. The last few actions were ""push south"" and ""push east"", but the response was that the bars are blocking the way. So the boulder isn't moving because there's something behind it (maybe the bars themselves or another obstacle). 

Wait, the message says ""You cannot pass through the bars,"" which suggests that when the agent tried to push, the boulder's intended path is blocked by bars. So the boulder is stuck because there's a bar in front of where it needs to go. The agent needs to position themselves such that they can push the boulder in a direction that's not blocked by bars. 

Looking at the map, the agent is at (38,15). The boulder is adjacent south and southwest. If the agent wants to push the boulder towards the fountain (which is southeast), they need to move the boulder south or east. But pushing east is blocked by bars. Pushing south is also blocked by bars. So maybe the boulder is against the bars, and the agent needs to move around to a different side where they can push it without hitting the bars. 

Alternatively, perhaps the agent needs to first move to a position where they can push the boulder in a valid direction. For example, if the boulder is at (38,16), and the agent is at (38,15), pushing south would be into bars. Maybe the agent needs to move west or north to get a better angle. 

Looking at the language observation, the bars are adjacent to north, northeast, and northwest. So the agent is near a lot of bars on the northern side. The boulder is adjacent south and southwest. The fountain is adjacent southeast. So the correct direction to push the boulder is southeast, but the path might be blocked. 

Wait, the fountain is adjacent southeast, so the boulder needs to be pushed onto that fountain. The agent is at (38,15). To push the boulder southeast, the agent would need to move east and south. But the agent tried pushing east and south before and got blocked by bars. Maybe the boulder is already next to the fountain, but the agent isn't in the right position to push it. 

Alternatively, maybe the boulder is stuck between bars and the fountain. The agent might need to move the boulder in a different direction first. For example, push the boulder north to free up the path, then move it east or southeast. But pushing north is blocked by bars. 

Another possibility is that the agent needs to move to the northwest or northeast of the boulder to push it in the desired direction. Since the boulder is adjacent southwest and southeast, the agent could position themselves to the northwest of the boulder and push it south, or to the northeast and push it east. However, the current position of the agent is (38,15), and the boulder is south and southwest. So if the boulder is at (38,16) or (37,15), the agent might need to adjust their position. 

Wait, the cursor shows the agent's position as (38,15), and the boulder is adjacent south and southwest. So the boulder is likely at (38,16) (south) and (37,15) (southwest). To push the boulder southeast towards the fountain, the agent would need to be to the northwest of the boulder. That would mean moving west to (37,15) and then pushing south-east. But the agent is already at (38,15), so moving west to (37,15) and then pushing the boulder southeast. However, the boulder's current position is adjacent south and southwest, so moving west to (37,15) would place the agent next to the boulder's southwest side. Then, pushing the boulder southeast would require the agent to be facing southeast and pushing. 

But the agent tried moving west and then pushing south, which was blocked by bars. So perhaps the bars are in the way of the boulder's path when pushed southeast. The agent might need to first move the boulder in a different direction that avoids the bars. For example, push the boulder north if possible, but that's blocked. Alternatively, push it west, but the boulder is already adjacent southwest. 

This is getting a bit confusing. Let me recap:

- Agent is at (38,15).
- Boulder is adjacent south (38,16) and southwest (37,15).
- Fountain is adjacent southeast (probably at (39,16) or similar).
- Bars are blocking the paths south and east.

The goal is to get the boulder onto the fountain. Since pushing south and east is blocked by bars, the agent needs to find another way. Maybe push the boulder west into a position where it can then be moved southeast. But the agent is already at (38,15), west of the boulder's southwest position (37,15). So if the agent moves west to (37,15), they would be next to the boulder's southwest corner. Then, pushing the boulder west would move it to (36,15), but that might not help. Alternatively, pushing the boulder southwest would move it to (37,14), but the agent needs to get it towards the fountain. 

Alternatively, the agent could move north to (38,14) and then try to push the boulder south, but the bars are adjacent north, so that's not possible. 

Wait, the bars are adjacent north, northeast, and northwest. So the agent's current position (38,15) has bars to the north, northeast, and northwest. That means the agent can't move north, northeast, or northwest without encountering bars. The only directions available are south, east, west, and perhaps southeast, southwest, etc., if there are no bars there. 

Looking at the map, the agent is in a corridor with bars around them. The boulder is to the south and southwest. The fountain is to the southeast. The agent needs to find a way to push the boulder from its current position towards the fountain without hitting bars. 

Perhaps the solution is to move the boulder south past the bars by finding a path. But the agent tried pushing south and got blocked. Maybe the boulder is stuck against the bars. So the agent needs to move to a different position to push the boulder in a direction that's not blocked. 

If the agent moves east to (39,15), then they can try pushing the boulder south or southeast. But the boulder is at (38,16) (south) and (37,15) (southwest). If the agent is at (39,15), pushing the boulder southeast would require the boulder to move to (40,16), which might be possible if there's no obstacle there. However, the language observation mentions that the fountain is adjacent southeast, so the boulder needs to be on the fountain. 

But how to get the boulder there without hitting bars. Alternatively, maybe the agent can push the boulder west into a position where it can then be pushed east. But the agent is already trying to push east and getting blocked. 

Another idea: the agent could try to push the boulder in a diagonal direction, but the game might not allow diagonal moves. The valid actions are north, south, east, west, and pushing in those directions. 

Given the current limitations, the best bet might be to move the agent to the position (39,15) and then push the boulder southeast. But how to get there. The agent is at (38,15). Moving east to (39,15) is possible if there's no barrier. The language observation says there's a dark area near east, but not necessarily a wall. So moving east might be feasible. 

Once at (39,15), the agent can try pushing the boulder southeast (direction to the fountain). If that's possible, the boulder would move to (40,16), which is on the fountain. 

But the agent needs to confirm if pushing from (39,15) southeast is possible. The boulder is at (38,16) (south of agent's current position). So if the agent is at (39,15), pushing the boulder southeast would require the boulder to move from (38,16) to (39,17), but the fountain is at (39,16), so that's not onto the fountain. Hmm, maybe not. 

Alternatively, if the boulder is at (38,16), pushing it east from (39,15) would move it to (39,16), which is the fountain. That could work. So the agent needs to move east to (39,15), then push the boulder east. 

But the agent's previous attempts to push east were blocked by bars. So why would that work now? Maybe the boulder's position allows it. Let me check the language observation again. It says the boulder is adjacent southeast and south. So the boulder is at (38,16) (south) and possibly (37,15) (southwest). If the agent moves east to (39,15), then the boulder at (38,16) is south of the agent. Pushing east from (39,15) would require the agent to push the boulder east, which would move it to (39,16), the fountain. But is there a bar in that path? The language observation says bars are very near north, northeast, etc., but not specifically blocking (39,16). 

Assuming there are no bars at (39,16), pushing the boulder east from (39,15) would place it on the fountain. So the correct action would be to move east to (39,15) and then push east. 

But the agent's last action was ""push east"", which was invalid. So maybe the agent needs to first move east to get into position. 

So the sequence would be: move east to (39,15), then push east. 

But how to confirm if moving east is possible. The agent's current position is (38,15). The language observation mentions a dark area near east, but not a wall. So moving east should be possible. 

Therefore, the next action should be ""east"" to move to (39,15), then ""push east"" to move the boulder onto the fountain.

",-0.001,False
86,Failed to obtain a valid action from the reasoning.,"<reasoning>
I need to figure out how to solve this Boxoban level. Let me start by looking at the current observation and the map.

The agent is a knight at position (39, 15). The map shows a lot of bars surrounding the area, indicating walls or obstacles. There's a boulder near the east and westnorthwest. The fountain is near eastsoutheast, which is probably the target for the boulder. The stairs up are near westsouthwest, so maybe the exit is there, but the goal here is to push the boulders onto fountains.

Looking at the language observation, the boulder is adjacent to south and southwest. The fountain is adjacent to southeast. So the boulder next to the southwest might need to be moved towards the southeast fountain. However, the barriers (bars) are adjacent to north, northeast, and northwest, making movement in those directions blocked.

The agent tried pushing south, east, and west before, but kept getting errors because of the bars. The last valid move was moving west to (38,15), then trying to push south again but failing due to bars. Now the cursor is back at (38,15) after moving west again.

The inventory has a long sword, lance, ring mail, etc., but no keys or tools that would help remove barriers. So the solution must involve navigating around the bars to push the boulder into the fountain.

The boulder is near east and westnorthwest. The one near east is probably the one to focus on since the fountain is eastsoutheast. If I can move the boulder from east towards southeast, that could work. But how to get past the bars?

Looking at the map, the bars are adjacent to north, northeast, and northwest. So moving north would hit a bar. Maybe moving south from (38,15) is possible if there's no bar there. Wait, the previous message said ""You cannot pass through the bars"" when trying to push south. But maybe just moving south directly without pushing is possible?

Wait, the agent's current position is (38,15). If they move south, they would go to (38,16). Is there a bar there? The language observation says bars very near north, etc., but doesn't mention south. The adjacent bars are north, northeast, northwest. So maybe moving south is possible. Let me check the map again.

The map at (38,15) has a '@' symbol. The line below (y=16) has a '<' which might be a door or another obstacle. Not sure. But since the agent tried pushing south before and it failed due to bars, maybe just moving south is allowed.

Alternatively, the boulder adjacent to south and southwest. If the agent can move west or southwest to get beside the boulder and push it east or southeast. But with the bars blocking north, northeast, northwest, moving west might be the way.

Wait, the agent is at (38,15). The boulder is near east and westnorthwest. The one near east is at (39,15) perhaps. To push that boulder east towards the fountain, the agent needs to be west of it. But the agent is already at (38,15), which is west of the boulder at (39,15). However, pushing east from (38,15) would require the space east to be clear. But the language observation says the boulder is adjacent southeast and south. So the boulder at (39,15) might be blocked by a bar or another obstacle.

Alternatively, the boulder adjacent south and southwest might be at (38,16) or (37,15). Need to parse the map better.

The map shows at y=15, the line is ""#...@{..`#"". The '@' is at position x=38 (since the string is index 0-based). So x=38 is the '@' position. To the east (x=39) is '{', which could be a boulder. So the boulder is at (39,15). To push it east towards the fountain at eastsoutheast (probably (41,15) or similar), but there's a bar very near north, etc., so maybe the path is blocked.

Alternatively, the boulder at westnorthwest, which would be somewhere like (37,13) or similar. Not sure. But the main immediate boulder to push is the one at (39,15).

Since the agent is at (38,15), west of the boulder, pushing east towards the fountain. But the message when trying to push east before was ""You cannot pass through the bars."" So maybe there's a bar east of the boulder. Looking at the language observation, bars very near north, etc., but the adjacent bars are north, northeast, northwest. The boulder at (39,15) has the fountain adjacent southeast, so maybe the path east is clear.

Wait, the fountain is adjacent southeast to the boulder. That means the boulder is north of the fountain. So to push the boulder southeast onto the fountain, the agent needs to position it so that pushing it southeast would land it on the fountain.

But the agent is at (38,15). To push the boulder at (39,15) east, the agent needs to be adjacent to it. They are already west of it. So pushing east should be possible if the space east of the boulder is clear. But the previous attempts to push east resulted in errors, likely because there's a bar there.

Looking at the map, the line at y=15 is ""#...@{..`#"". The part after the '@' is ""{"", which might be a boulder. Then comes ""..`#"". The '`' could be a floor, and '#' is a wall or bar. So after pushing the boulder east, the next cell would be '`', which is floor, then maybe another cell. But if there's a bar east of the boulder, that would prevent movement.

The language observation mentions ""bars very near north, northnortheast, northeast, southeast, southsoutheast, south, southsouthwest, southwest, westnorthwest, and northwest"". So near the boulder at (39,15), there might be bars to the east. That would block pushing the boulder east.

In that case, the agent needs to find another way to move the boulder. Perhaps by moving around to the south or west. But the bars are adjacent to north, northeast, and northwest, so moving north is blocked. Moving west would take the agent back to (37,15), but there's a boulder adjacent southeast and south there. Maybe that's another boulder.

Wait, the language observation says ""boulder adjacent southeast and south"" at the current position. So the boulder at (38,15) is south of the agent? No, the agent is at (38,15), and the boulder is adjacent southeast and south. So the boulder would be at (38,16) southeast and (39,15) south? Not sure. Maybe the agent is next to two boulders.

This is getting confusing. Let me try to parse the coordinates again.

The agent is at (38,15). The map line for y=15 is ""#...@{..`#"". The '@' is at x=38. To the east (x=39) is '{', which is a boulder. So the boulder is at (39,15). Pushing it east would require the space at (40,15) to be clear. The next character after '{' is '.', which is floor, so maybe that's clear. But the language observation says bars very near the area, so perhaps there's a bar at (40,15) that wasn't detected.

Alternatively, the bars mentioned are in various directions, but the immediate east of the boulder might be blocked by a bar. If that's the case, the agent can't push the boulder east. In that case, maybe the solution is to move the other boulder, the one at westnorthwest.

The westnorthwest boulder is adjacent to the agent's current position's southwest. So the agent is at (38,15), southwest would be (37,14). But the boulder is at westnorthwest, maybe (36,13) or similar. Not sure. To reach that boulder, the agent would need to move west and north, but those directions are blocked by bars.

Hmm. Maybe the only movable boulder is the one at (39,15). Since the agent is west of it, and pushing east is blocked by bars, perhaps the agent needs to move south to get around the bars and then push the boulder.

The agent is at (38,15). Moving south to (38,16). The map line for y=16 is ""#<.@``{.{#"". The '@' is at (37,16), so the agent moving south to (38,16) would land on a '.' which is floor. That seems possible.

Once the agent is at (38,16), they could try pushing the boulder from the south. But the boulder is at (39,15), so the agent would need to be adjacent to it. From (38,16), moving east to (39,16) and then push south? Not sure.

Alternatively, after moving south to (38,16), the agent could move east to (39,16) and then try pushing the boulder at (39,15) southwards. But that would require the space at (39,16) to be clear, which it might not be.

This is getting complicated. Let me think of the priorities. The goal is to push the boulder onto the fountain. The fountain is at eastsoutheast, which is probably to the southeast of the agent. The boulder at (39,15) is east of the agent. If the agent can push it further east into the fountain's position, that would solve the level.

But the barrier is blocking the path. Maybe the agent needs to find a way to move around the barrier. Since pushing isn't working, maybe moving in a different direction to create space.

Alternatively, maybe the stairs up at westsouthwest are a red herring, and the real goal is just to push the boulder, not use the stairs.

Wait, in Boxoban, the goal is to push all boulders onto targets (fountains in this case). So the agent needs to get the boulder onto the fountain. The fountain is adjacent southeast to the boulder, so if the boulder is moved one step further southeast, it would be on the fountain.

But how to get there. The agent is at (38,15), west of the boulder. To move the boulder east, the path must be clear. But previous attempts failed because of bars. Maybe the bars are not in the same row.

Looking at the language observation: ""bars very near north, northnortheast, northeast, southeast, southsoutheast, south, southsouthwest, southwest, westnorthwest, and northwest"". So there are bars in various directions around the agent's current position. The immediate east of the boulder (at (39,15)) might have a bar to the east, preventing the agent from pushing it further.

In that case, the agent needs to move the boulder in another direction. Since the boulder is at (39,15), maybe pushing it north or west. But pushing north would hit the bars adjacent to north. Pushing west would require the agent to be at (38,15) and push west, but the boulder is already at (39,15), so pushing west would move it to (38,15), which is where the agent is. That's not possible.

Alternatively, the other boulder at westnorthwest. Maybe the agent can move to that area and push it towards a fountain. But the agent is blocked by bars in the north, northeast, and northwest directions.

This is tricky. Maybe the solution is to move the agent to the southwest of the current position to access the other boulder. But movement there is blocked by bars.

Alternatively, the agent could try to pick up an item, but the inventory doesn't have anything useful except weapons and armor, which aren't relevant here.

Wait, the agent has a blessed lance. Maybe using the lance to break obstacles? But in Boxoban, I don't think you can break walls; you can only push boulders. So that's not helpful.

Perhaps the key is to realize that the boulder adjacent southeast and south is the one at (38,16) or similar. If the agent moves south to (38,16), they could then push the boulder from there.

Looking at the map at y=16, the agent would move to (38,16), which is a '.' (floor). Then, moving east to (39,16), which is '`' (floor), and then push the boulder at (39,15) south to (39,16). But the boulder's current position is at (39,15), and pushing it south would require the space at (39,16) to be clear. The character at (39,16) is '`', which is floor, so that should be possible.

Once pushed, the boulder would be at (39,16). Then, the agent could push it further south to (39,17), and so on, until it reaches the fountain. But the fountain is adjacent southeast, so maybe the boulder needs to be pushed to a specific coordinate.

Alternatively, after pushing the boulder south once, the agent could move east and push it again towards the southeast.

This seems like a possible path. So the steps would be:

1. Move south from (38,15) to (38,16).
2. Move east to (39,16).
3. Push the boulder at (39,15) south to (39,16).
4. From (39,16), push the boulder east to (40,16).
5. Continue pushing until it reaches the fountain.

But need to check if the path is clear. The language observation mentions bars very near the area, but maybe not in the specific path the boulder will take.

Another possibility is that the fountain is at (40,15), so pushing the boulder from (39,15) east to (40,15) would place it on the fountain. However, if there's a bar at (40,15), that would block it. The language observation says ""bars very near ... southeast"", which could include (40,15).

If that's the case, then pushing east directly isn't possible. The agent would need to find another way around.

Alternatively, the agent could push the boulder north, but that's blocked by bars.

This is quite challenging. Given the previous attempts and the lack of progress, maybe the best action is to keep trying to push the boulder in different directions, perhaps adjusting the agent's position to find a valid path.

Given the current position at (38,15), and the boulder at (39,15), the only feasible direction to push is east or south. But east is blocked by bars, so maybe south.

Wait, pushing south from (39,15) would move the boulder to (39,16). If that's allowed, then the agent could do that. But the agent is at (38,15), so to push the boulder south, the agent needs to be south of it. Which means the agent would have to move east to (39,15) first, which is the boulder's position. That's not possible.

Ah, right. To push a boulder, the agent must be adjacent to it and move in the direction of the push. So the agent needs to be north, south, east, or west of the boulder and then push it in that direction.

The boulder at (39,15) is east of the agent at (38,15). So the agent is west of the boulder. To push it east, the agent needs to be west of it and move east, which would push the boulder east. But previous attempts resulted in ""You cannot pass through the bars,"" indicating there's an obstacle in the way.

Looking at the map, after pushing the boulder east to (40,15), the next cell is '`' (floor), then '#' which is a bar. So the boulder can't be pushed past the bar. Therefore, the agent needs to find a way to move the boulder around the bar.

Alternatively, maybe the bar is not in the straight line. The language observation says ""bars very near ... southeast"", which might mean that the bar is at (40,15), preventing the boulder from being pushed east into the fountain.

In that case, the agent needs to find another way to position the boulder. Perhaps by moving it north or south around the bar.

But moving the boulder north from (39,15) would hit the bars adjacent to north. Moving it south to (39,16) is possible if there's no bar there.

So the plan could be:

1. Agent at (38,15) pushes the boulder at (39,15) south to (39,16).
2. Then, from (39,16), agent can push the boulder further south to (39,17), and so on, until it's near the fountain.

But the fountain is at eastsoutheast, which might be a few steps east and south. However, without knowing the exact map layout, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, after pushing the boulder south once to (39,16), the agent could move east to (40,16) and then push the boulder east to (41,16), towards the fountain.

But again, if there's a bar at (41,16), that would block it.

Given the uncertainty, the safest bet might be to keep trying to push the boulder in the possible directions, adjusting the agent's position as needed.

Another approach: The agent is at (38,15). The boulder is at (39,15). The fountain is southeast of the boulder. So the agent needs to push the boulder east and then south or vice versa.

But since pushing east is blocked, maybe push south first, then east.

So step-by-step:

- Agent at (38,15) moves east to (39,15) (but that's the boulder, can't move there).
- Instead, agent needs to be north, south, east, or west of the boulder to push it.

Wait, the agent is west of the boulder. To push east, the agent needs to be west of the boulder and move east, which would push the boulder east.

But why did previous attempts fail? Because there's a bar east of the boulder.

So the agent should check if there's a way to move the boulder around the bar. For example, push it north around the bar, but that's blocked. Push it south around.

So:

1. Agent at (38,15) pushes the boulder east to (40,15) but can't due to bar.
2. Instead, agent moves south to (38,16), then east to (39,16), then pushes the boulder south to (39,17).
3. Repeat until the boulder is positioned near the fountain.

This requires the path south from the boulder to be clear.

Given that the map at y=16 has a '<' at (37","

Let's try to figure out what to do here. The agent is in a Boxoban-like game, needing to push boulders onto fountains. The cursor is at (39,15), and there's a boulder adjacent to the south and southwest. The fountains are nearby to the southeast.

Looking at the map, the agent is facing east, with bars blocking movement north. The boulder is to the south and southwest. The goal is to push the boulder towards the fountain. Since the boulder is adjacent to the south, maybe pushing it south would move it towards the fountain. But I need to check if there's space behind the boulder. If the path is clear, pushing south would be the way to go. Alternatively, the boulder to the southwest might need to be moved first, but it's adjacent, so pushing it west or south might be possible. However, the immediate target is the fountain to the southeast. Let's focus on the southern boulder. If I push south, the boulder would move to (39,16), which should be adjacent to the fountain. That seems like a good plan. Let me confirm the map layout. The cursor is at (39,15), and the boulder is south. So pushing south would move the boulder to (39,16), which is towards the fountain at southeast. Yes, that should work. Let's try pushing south again.

Let's tackle this problem. The agent is in Boxoban, a Sokoban-like game where the goal is to push boulders onto fountains. Let's look at the current state.

The agent's position is (39, 15). The map shows walls (bars), dark areas, a boulder nearby, and a fountain to the southeast. The most urgent task is to get the boulder onto the fountain. 

Looking at the observations, there's a boulder adjacent to the southeast and south. The fountain is very near the eastsoutheast. The agent is at (39,15), and the boulder is to the southeast. The agent tried pushing south before, but there were bars blocking the way. Now, after moving east to (39,15), the next step is to see if the path to the boulder is clear.

Wait, the map shows that the boulder is very near westnorthwest. Wait, but the agent is at (39,15), which is east of where the boulder was previously. Maybe the boulder is now to the southeast? Let me check the latest observations. 

The language observation mentions a boulder very near westnorthwest. Wait, that's confusing. The agent is at (39,15), so westnorthwest would be to the northwest direction. But there's also a boulder adjacent southeast and south. Hmm, maybe there are multiple boulders. The fountain is adjacent east, so perhaps one boulder is near there and another further west.

The agent needs to navigate to the boulder and push it towards the fountain. Let's see the possible moves. The agent is at (39,15). If there's a boulder to the southeast (direction south or east), the agent can try to move towards it. However, the bars are adjacent north, northeast, and northwest, which might block movement in those directions. 

The previous attempts to push south or east resulted in messages about bars blocking. So, maybe the agent needs to move around the bars first. The stairs up are near westsouthwest, which is to the southwest of the agent's current position. Moving west might lead towards the stairs, but the goal is to push the boulder, not go down.

Alternatively, looking at the map, the agent's current position is near the symbol '<' which indicates stairs up. The boulder is very near westnorthwest, which would be to the left (west) and up (north) a bit. But the agent is at (39,15), so westnorthwest would be (38,14) maybe. But the latest map shows the agent's position with '@' at (39,15), and the boulder symbols '{' and '.' nearby. 

Wait, the map shows:
#....@..`# at row 8 (assuming y=15 is row 8?), and #<..``{.{# at row 9. The '<' is part of the stairs up. The boulder symbols '{' might be near there. So perhaps the boulder is to the east or southeast of the agent. 

The agent needs to move towards the boulder. Since pushing south was blocked by bars, maybe moving east again to get closer to the boulder. Alternatively, check if there's a path west to reach the boulder. 

The latest cursor position is (39,15), and the boulder is very near westnorthwest. So westnorthwest from (39,15) would be (38,14). But there's a bar adjacent north, northeast, and northwest. So moving north would hit a bar. Moving west to (38,15) is possible if there's no obstacle. The map shows at row 8, column 38 is '.' which is floor, so moving west to (38,15) is possible. From there, moving north might be possible if there's no bar. 

Alternatively, the agent could try to move east again to (40,15) and see if there's a path. But the map shows that moving east from (39,15) leads to a '.' which is floor, so that's possible. Then from there, push the boulder south or east towards the fountain. 

Wait, the fountain is adjacent east, so pushing the boulder east would put it on the fountain. But the agent is at (39,15), and the fountain is adjacent east, which would be (40,15). If there's a boulder at (40,15), pushing it east would place it on the fountain. But according to the latest observations, the boulder is very near westnorthwest, which is not near the east side. Maybe there's another boulder. 

This is getting a bit confusing. Let me summarize the key points:

- Agent is at (39,15).
- Nearby boulders: one very near westnorthwest (possibly (38,14)) and one adjacent southeast and south.
- Fountain is adjacent east (at (40,15)), which is a good target.
- Bars are blocking movement north, northeast, and northwest.

The immediate goal is to get the boulder onto the east fountain. If the boulder is to the southeast, the agent needs to move towards it. But the agent is blocked by bars to the north, northeast, and northwest. So moving west or east might be the way. 

Moving west to (38,15) is possible if that's a floor. From there, check if there's a path north or east. If moving west, then from (38,15), maybe push the boulder that's at westnorthwest (38,14) south towards the agent, then east towards the fountain. 

Alternatively, moving east to (40,15) where the fountain is, but there's a boulder adjacent southeast and south. So perhaps the boulder is at (40,16) or (40,15). If the agent moves east to (40,15), and there's a boulder there, they can push it east into the fountain. 

But the latest observation says the boulder is adjacent southeast and south of the agent. So if the agent is at (39,15), southeast would be (39,16) and south (40,15). So if there's a boulder at (40,15), pushing it east to (41,15) would place it on the fountain at (40,15)? Wait, no. The fountain is adjacent east, which is (40,15). So if the boulder is at (40,15), pushing it east would take it to (41,15), but the fountain is at (40,15). So the correct move would be to push the boulder east into the fountain. 

But according to the language observation, the boulder is adjacent southeast and south. So southeast of (39,15) is (39,16), south is (40,15). So if there's a boulder at (40,15), pushing it east would be the way. However, the agent is at (39,15), and moving south to (40,15) would reach the boulder. But the message says ""You cannot pass through the bars,"" which were adjacent north, northeast, and northwest. So moving south from (39,15) to (40,15) might be possible if there's no bar there. 

Looking at the map, the row 8 (y=15) at column 39 is '@', then '.' which is floor. So moving south to (40,15) is possible. Then, if there's a boulder at (40,15), the agent can push it east. 

But the previous attempts to push south resulted in error messages about bars. Maybe there's a bar in that direction now. Let me check the latest map. The map shows row 8 as #....@..`#, which at column 39 is '@', then '.' at 40. So moving south to (40,15) is floor. Then, if there's a boulder at (40,15), the agent can push it east. 

Wait, the boulder is adjacent southeast and south. So the boulder could be at (39,16) (southeast) or (40,15) (south). If it's at (40,15), then pushing south is possible. But earlier attempts to push south resulted in bars blocking. Maybe the bars are dynamic or there's a misunderstanding. 

Alternatively, perhaps the boulder is at (39,16) (southeast), and the agent needs to move east to get next to it. 

This requires careful navigation. Given the confusion in the map layout, the safest bet is to move towards the fountain, which is east. So move east to (40,15), then push the boulder east into the fountain. 

But the agent needs to be adjacent to the boulder to push it. If the boulder is at (40,15), moving south to get there. However, the agent is already at (39,15). Moving south to (40,15) is possible if that's a floor and not blocked by a bar. 

Given that the latest observation mentions bars adjacent north, northeast, and northwest, but not south, moving south should be possible. Once the agent is at (40,15), if there's a boulder there, they can push it east. 

So the steps would be: move south to (40,15), then push east into the fountain. 

But the previous attempts to push south resulted in error messages. Maybe the boulder isn't there anymore, or there's a different obstacle. 

Alternatively, the agent could move east to (40,15) first, then check for the boulder. 

Given the current position, the best action is to move south to (40,15) and attempt to push the boulder east into the fountain.

",-0.001,False
89,west,"<reasoning>
I need to figure out how to solve this Boxoban level. Let's start by understanding the current situation.

Looking at the observations, the agent is at position (39,15). There's a boulder adjacent to the south and southwest. The fountain is to the southeast, so the goal is to push the boulder onto that fountain. However, the path might be blocked by bars and dark areas. 

The map shows a lot of bars around, which are obstacles. The agent tried pushing the boulder east and south before, but the bars are preventing movement. Maybe the boulder needs to be moved around the barriers. Let's check the adjacent spaces. To the south of the boulder (which is at (39,15)), there's a fountain, which is the target. But the agent can't move the boulder directly south because there's a bar adjacent north, northeast, and northwest of the agent's current position. 

Wait, the boulder is adjacent to the agent's south and southwest. So the boulder is either at (39,16) or (38,15). If it's at (39,16), then pushing it south would move it towards the fountain. But the message says trying to push the boulder fails. Maybe there's something blocking the path. Let me check the language observations again. The bars are very near north, northeast, etc., so maybe the path to the fountain is blocked by bars. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to reposition themselves to push the boulder in a different direction. Since the boulder is adjacent to the south and southwest, perhaps pushing it southwest towards the fountain would work. But the agent's current position is (39,15), and pushing southwest would require moving the boulder to (38,14), but there might be bars or other obstacles there. 

The stairs up are near westsouthwest, which is probably not useful right now. The key is to get the boulder onto the fountain at southeast. The fountain is very near eastsoutheast, so the boulder needs to be moved eastward. But the agent is already to the east of the boulder. Maybe the boulder is to the west of the agent? Wait, the agent is at (39,15), and the boulder is adjacent southeast and south. So the boulder is likely at (40,15) or (39,16). If it's at (40,15), pushing east would move it towards the fountain. But the agent tried pushing east before and got a message that they can't move the boulder. Maybe there's a bar in the way. 

Looking at the map, the agent is in a corridor with bars on the north, northeast, and northwest. The boulder is to the southeast and south. The fountain is at eastsoutheast. So perhaps the agent needs to move the boulder south first, then east. But the bars are blocking that path. Alternatively, move the boulder southwest around the blocks. 

Wait, the bars adjacent to the agent are north, northeast, and northwest. So the agent can't move north, northeast, or northwest. Their movement is restricted to south, east, west, and possibly pushing the boulder in those directions. 

Since the boulder is adjacent south and southwest, maybe pushing it southwest would free up the south direction. Let's try that. The action would be ""push southwest"". But the available actions are north, east, south, west, and push in those directions. So ""push southwest"" is not directly an option. The agent can only push in the four cardinal directions. 

So the agent can try to push the boulder south or southwest by moving in those directions. If the boulder is at (39,16), pushing south would move it to (39,17). But if there's a bar there, it won't work. Alternatively, pushing southwest would move it to (38,16), but again, depends on obstacles. 

The message says ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" So previous push attempts failed. Maybe the path is blocked by bars. Let me check the language observation again. The bars very near include south, southeast, etc. So perhaps the boulder can't be moved south because there's a bar in the way. 

In that case, the agent needs to find another way to position the boulder. Maybe move around the bars and then push the boulder towards the fountain. But the agent's current position is east of the boulder, and the bars are to the north, northeast, and northwest. So moving west might be possible if there's no bar. 

Looking at the cursor position, the agent is at (39,15). Moving west would take them to (38,15), which has a boulder adjacent southeast and south. So if the boulder is at (38,15), pushing west isn't possible. Alternatively, if the boulder is at (39,16), pushing west would move it to (38,16), but again, need to check for obstacles. 

The agent's inventory has a +1 long sword and a lance, but no tools that would help break walls or remove bars. So the solution must involve navigating around the bars and pushing the boulder through clear paths. 

Since the agent can't move north, northeast, or northwest due to bars, the only viable directions are south, east, and west. Moving east takes them to (40,15), which might be clear. Let me check the map. The map shows at position (39,15) the agent is at ""@"", and to the east is ""{"", which is a boulder. So pushing east would require moving the boulder from (39,15) east to (40,15). But the message says previous pushes failed, maybe because there's a bar in the way. 

Looking at the language observation, the bars adjacent to the agent are north, northeast, and northwest. There's no mention of bars to the east or south. So perhaps pushing east is possible. Wait, but the boulder is at (39,15)'s east, which is (40,15). So pushing east would move the boulder to (41,15), but need to check if that's clear. 

The fountain is at eastsoutheast, which is probably (41,16) or similar. If the boulder is moved east to (41,15), then pushing it south to (41,16) would place it on the fountain. But first, the agent needs to get past the current obstacles. 

Alternatively, the agent could move south to (39,16) and then try to push the boulder east or southeast. But the agent tried pushing south before and got a message about bars. 

I think the key is to find a clear path for the boulder to the fountain. Given the barriers, the agent might need to move the boulder in a direction that circumvents the bars. Since the boulder is adjacent to the agent's south and southwest, pushing it southwest (which would be to (38,16)) might be possible if that path is clear. 

But how to determine if (38,16) is clear? The language observation mentions bars very near north, northeast, etc., but not specifically at (38,16). The agent's current position is (39,15), and pushing southwest would take the boulder to (38,16). If there are no bars there, it could work. 

Alternatively, the agent could move west to (38,15), which has a boulder adjacent southeast and south. If the agent moves west, they are at (38,15), next to the boulder. Then, pushing the boulder south to (38,16) might be possible. 

But the agent's previous attempts to push have failed, so maybe the path is blocked. The dark areas might also be obstructive. 

Given the limited information, the safest bet might be to keep trying to push the boulder in directions that seem clear. Since the fountain is to the southeast, perhaps pushing the boulder east first, then south. But the agent is already east of the boulder. 

Wait, the boulder is at (39,15)'s east, which is (40,15). So pushing east from (39,15) would move the boulder to (40,15). If that's clear, then the agent can continue pushing it south to (40,16), then east to (41,16) where the fountain is. 

But the message says ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" when the agent tried pushing east before. So maybe there's a bar at (40,15). The language observation mentions bars very near south, southeast, etc., but not specifically at (40,15). 

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to move around the boulder. For example, move south to (39,16), then push the boulder east. 

But the agent's current position is (39,15). Moving south to (39,16) and then trying to push the boulder east (which is now at (40,16)) might be possible. 

Given that the agent has tried pushing south and east before without success, perhaps the correct action now is to try pushing the boulder southwest. However, since the available actions are only the four directions, the agent can only push north, south, east, or west. 

Wait, in Boxoban, pushing a boulder is done by moving in the direction you want the boulder to go. So to push the boulder southwest, the agent would need to move southwest, which isn't a direct action. The agent can only move north, south, east, west, or push in those directions. 

So to push the boulder southwest, the agent would have to push it south then west, or west then south. 

Given the current position, pushing the boulder south to (39,16) and then west to (38,16) might work. 

But the agent's previous attempts to push south resulted in failure because of bars. Let me check the language observation again. The bars adjacent to the agent are north, northeast, and northwest. So moving south is possible unless there's a bar there. The message says when trying to push, it fails because of bars. 

So perhaps the path south from the boulder is blocked. The boulder is at (40,15), and pushing it south to (40,16) is blocked by a bar. 

In that case, the agent needs to find another way to move the boulder. Since all cardinal directions are blocked by bars except east and west, maybe the agent should move west to (38,15) and then push the boulder south or southwest. 

Moving west from (39,15) to (38,15) is possible if there's no obstacle. The language observation says bars near north, northeast, etc., but not specifically at (38,15). The boulder is adjacent southeast and south there, so maybe moving west is clear. 

Once the agent is at (38,15), they can try pushing the boulder south to (38,16) or southwest to (37,16). If that's clear, then the boulder can be guided towards the fountain. 

Alternatively, pushing the boulder east from (38,15) to (39,15), but the agent is already there. 

This is getting a bit complicated. Let me summarize the possible steps:

1. Move west to (38,15) to reposition.
2. Push the boulder south to (38,16).
3. From (38,16), push the boulder east to (39,16).
4. From (39,16), push the boulder east to (40,16) onto the fountain.

But need to check if each step is possible. 

The agent is currently at (39,15). Moving west to (38,15): is that free? The language observation mentions bars near north, northeast, etc., but not at (38,15). The boulder is at (39,15)'s east, so moving west would be into a space that's not blocked by bars. So ""west"" action should be possible. 

Once at (38,15), the boulder is adjacent southeast and south. So pushing south would move it to (38,16). If there's no bar there, this works. 

Assuming that's possible, then the agent can proceed. 

So the next action should be ""west"" to move to (38,15), then ""push south"" to move the boulder to (38,16). 

But the user is asking for the next action based on the current observation. The current position is (39,15), and the agent needs to choose an action. 

Given that the previous attempts to push east and south failed due to bars, the best next step is to try moving west to reposition and then attempt to push the boulder in a different direction. 

So the action should be ""west"".

",-0.001,False
90,push south,"<reasoning>
Let's try to figure out what the agent needs to do here. The goal is to push the boulders onto the fountains. Looking at the current map and observations, the agent is at position (38, 15). There's a boulder adjacent to the southeast and south. The fountain is adjacent to the east, so that's probably where one of the boulders needs to go.

First, the agent tried pushing east before, but got a message that they couldn't pass through bars. So the bars are blocking that path. The boulder near east might be behind some bars, making it impossible to push further east. The agent needs to find another way to position the boulder towards the east fountain.

Looking at the cursor position, the agent is west of the boulder. To push the boulder south, the agent needs to move close to it and then push. The current observation shows a boulder adjacent to the southeast and south. If the agent moves south, they might be able to push the boulder east when possible.

Wait, the latest observation after moving west back to (38,15) shows the boulder adjacent to southeast and south. So the agent is at (38,15), and the boulder is to the southeast (maybe at 39,16) or south (38,16)? The map shows the boulder with `{` at (38,15) adjacent to south and southeast. Hmm, maybe the boulder is at (38,16) or (39,15). 

The fountain is adjacent to east, which is at (39,15)'s east, so (39,16)? But there are bars blocking the way east. The agent needs to get the boulder to the fountain at east. Since bars are blocking the direct path, maybe the agent has to move the boulder south or southeast towards the fountain.

The agent previously tried pushing south, but maybe that's not the right direction. Let's see: if the boulder is at (38,16), pushing it south would take it to (38,17), but are there obstacles there? The map doesn't show anything, but the bars are very near in various directions. Alternatively, pushing the boulder east when possible. But the bars are blocking east, so the agent needs to find a way around.

Another thought: the stairs up are near westsouthwest, which is probably not helpful right now. The priority is to get the boulder onto the fountain. The fountain is at east, so maybe pushing the boulder east when there's a clear path. But the bars are in the way. Perhaps the agent needs to move north or west to create a path.

Wait, the bars adjacent north, northeast, and northwest. So moving north might hit the bars. The agent is at (38,15). If they move north, they'd hit the bars. Moving west to (37,15) might be possible, but then the boulder is still to the southeast. Alternatively, pushing the boulder south to (38,16), then maybe from there push east if there's a way around the bars.

But the latest observation after moving west shows the boulder adjacent southeast and south. So if the agent is at (38,15), the boulder could be at (38,16) (south) or (39,15) (southeast). If it's at (38,16), pushing it south to (38,17) might be possible, but then how to get it east? Alternatively, if the boulder is at (39,15) (southeast), pushing it east to (39,16) towards the fountain. But there are bars very near in that area, so maybe that's blocked.

The agent's inventory has a blessed +1 lance, which is a good weapon, but maybe not immediately useful for pushing boulders. The main task is to push the boulder using movement/actions.

Considering all this, the best immediate action might be to try pushing the boulder south towards a position where it can then be moved east once the path is clear. Alternatively, if the boulder is to the southeast, push it east when possible. But given the bars, maybe pushing south first is better.

Wait, the message when trying to push east earlier said ""You cannot pass through the bars."" So the path east is blocked by bars. Therefore, the boulder can't be pushed directly east. The agent needs to find a way to move the boulder around the bars. Perhaps pushing it south to a position where the bars are not blocking, then east.

So the agent's current position is (38,15). The boulder is adjacent south and southeast. If the boulder is at (38,16) (south), pushing it south to (38,17) could free up the path. Then, from (38,17), maybe move east around the bars. Alternatively, if the boulder is at (39,15) (southeast), pushing it east to (39,16) might work if there's no bars there.

But the latest map shows the agent's position at (38,15) with the boulder adjacent to south and southeast. The `<` symbol is at (39,15) on the map, which might be another character or object. Wait, the map line for y=15 is:

#...@{..`#  and the next line (y=16) is #<..``{.{# 

So the agent is at (38,15) with the `@`. The `{` is at (38,15) adjacent to south and southeast, meaning the boulder is at (38,16) (south) and (39,15) (southeast). So two boulders? Or one that's adjacent in both directions? Maybe it's one boulder at (38,16), which is south of the agent, and another at (39,15), southeast.

But the problem states there's one boulder near east. Hmm, perhaps the observation mentions multiple boulders. The agent's goal is to push all boulders onto fountains. The fountain is adjacent east at (39,16), I think.

So the boulder at (38,16) (south of agent) can be pushed south to (38,17), then maybe from there find a path east. Alternatively, the boulder at (39,15) (southeast) can be pushed east to (39,16), which is the fountain, but there are bars very near southeast, so that path might be blocked.

Looking at the language observation: bars very near southeast, southsoutheast, south, etc. So moving east from (39,15) to (39,16) would be into a bar area. Therefore, that's not possible. So the boulder at (39,15) can't be pushed east directly.

The other boulder at (38,16) (south of agent) can be pushed south to (38,17). Once there, maybe the agent can move east around the bars. The bars are very near north, northeast, etc., but further south might be clear.

Alternatively, the agent could move west to (37,15) and then try to push the boulder at (38,16) eastwards. But the bars are adjacent north, northeast, and northwest, which are in the way when moving north or west.

The best bet seems to be pushing the southern boulder (at 38,16) south to 38,17. Then, from there, maybe move east if possible. Let's check the bars in that area. The bars very near southeast, southsoutheast, etc., are at the current position, but further south might have different obstacles.

Alternatively, if the agent pushes the boulder at (38,16) east to (39,16), but that's blocked by bars. So pushing south seems safer.

Therefore, the next action should be to push the boulder south. The agent is at (38,15), the boulder is at (38,16), so pushing south would move it to (38,17). This would free up the agent's position to potentially move east later.

91,push east,"<reasoning>
Let's see where I am. I'm in Boxoban, right? So my goal is to push all the boulders onto the fountains. From the observations, there's a boulder near east and another very near westnorthwest. The fountains are adjacent to east and eastsoutheast.

Looking at the map, my current position is (38,15). The boulder I can see is at east, which might be near (39,15) or similar. The fountain is adjacent to east, so maybe moving east to push the boulder onto the fountain? But when I tried pushing east before, it didn't work. Wait, the message said ""You cannot pass through the bars,"" so there must be bars blocking the way. The language observation mentions bars adjacent to various directions. 

Wait, the bars adjacent north, northeast, and northwest. So if I'm at (38,15), north would be (38,14), but there are bars there. Maybe I need to find a way around the bars to reach the boulder. Alternatively, perhaps the boulder is behind some bars that I can't push through. 

Looking at the cursor position and the map, the agent is @ at (38,15). The map shows a boulder ({) near east, which is probably at (39,15). To push it south onto the fountain adjacent southeast, I need to position myself so that pushing south would move the boulder into the fountain. But the current observation says the boulder is adjacent southeast and south. Maybe the boulder is already next to a fountain, but I haven't pushed it onto it yet.

Wait, the language observation says ""boulder adjacent southeast and south."" So the boulder is next to southeast and south directions. The fountain is adjacent east. Maybe the boulder is not on the fountain yet. So I need to get behind the boulder and push it in the right direction. 

But how to get behind it? The boulder is at east, so if I move east to (39,15), but there are bars adjacent to east. The message when trying to push east before said ""You cannot pass through the bars."" So the path to push the boulder is blocked by bars. Therefore, I need to find another way to position the boulder. 

Alternatively, maybe the boulder is at (38,16) south of me. If I move south to (38,16), and then push east, but I need to check if there's space. The map shows a boulder very near westnorthwest. Maybe that's another boulder. 

Wait, the cursor is at (38,15). The map line for y=15 has ""#...@{..`#"" which suggests the @ is at position 5 (0-indexed?), and the boulder { is at position 6. So the boulder is to the east of the agent. To push it, the agent needs to be west of the boulder. But the agent is already west of the boulder at (38,15) since the boulder is at (38,15) east? Wait, no. The map's x and y coordinates might be different. Let me clarify:

In the map, each '#' represents a wall or obstacle. The line for y=15 is ""#...@{..`#"". So breaking it down:

Positions (x from 0 to 9, assuming 10 characters):

0: #
1: .
2: .
3: .
4: @
5: {
6: .
7: `
8: #
9: #

So the agent is at x=4, y=15 (since the line is y=15). The boulder { is at x=5, y=15. To push the boulder east, the agent needs to be at x=4, y=15 (which they are), and then push east. But earlier attempts to push east resulted in a message saying ""You cannot pass through the bars."" Wait, but according to the language observation, bars are adjacent north, northeast, and northwest. The agent's position is (38,15), but in the map, it's x=4, y=15. Maybe there's confusion in the coordinate system. 

Alternatively, perhaps the bars are blocking the path to the boulder. The message when trying to push east before said ""You cannot pass through the bars,"" which implies that there's a bar in the direction of the push. So if I'm trying to push the boulder east, but there's a bar at (6,15), then I can't move it past that. 

Given that the boulder is at (5,15) and the agent is at (4,15), pushing east would move the boulder to (6,15). But if there's a bar at (6,15), then that's why it's not working. So I need to check the map for obstacles at (6,15). The map shows at x=6, y=15 is a '.', which is floor, so maybe not a bar. Wait, the bars are mentioned in the language observation but not visible on the map. The map might use different symbols. 

Alternatively, the bars are represented by '#' in the map. Looking at the map, the first few lines are all '##########', which are walls. The agent's position is in a corridor with some '.' and symbols like @, {, etc. The boulder { is at (5,15), and the agent is at (4,15). To push east, the next position (6,15) is a '.', which should be accessible. But the message says there are bars preventing movement. This is conflicting. 

Maybe the bars are not on the map but are in the game's entities. The language observation says ""bars adjacent north, northeast, and northwest"" from the agent's position. So north of (38,15) would be (38,14), which has a bar. Therefore, the agent cannot move north, but pushing the boulder east would require moving into a direction not blocked by bars. 

Perhaps the correct action is to move south to get around the bars blocking the north direction, then position yourself to push the boulder east. Alternatively, since the boulder is already adjacent to the southeast and south, maybe it's near a fountain, but not on it. Wait, the language observation says ""fountain adjacent east,"" so the fountain is to the east of the agent. If the boulder is at (5,15) east of the agent, pushing it east would move it to (6,15), which is adjacent to the fountain at east (position 6,15). So if the fountain is at (6,15), then pushing the boulder there would solve the puzzle. 

But earlier attempts to push east failed. Maybe because there's a bar in the way. The bars are adjacent north, northeast, and northwest. The agent's position (38,15) has bars to the north (38,14), northeast (39,14), and northwest (37,14). So pushing the boulder east (to 39,15) is possible if there's no bar there. The map shows at (39,15) a '`' which is probably a floor. So maybe the issue is that the boulder is being blocked by another obstacle. 

Alternatively, the boulder is stuck because there's a bar behind it. If the boulder is at (5,15), and pushing east requires moving it to (6,15), but there's a bar at (6,15), then it's impossible. But the map shows (6,15) as '`', which is floor. So perhaps the problem is elsewhere. 

Another possibility is that the agent needs to be adjacent to the boulder to push it. The agent is at (4,15), and the boulder is at (5,15), so they are adjacent. Therefore, pushing east should be possible. But previous attempts resulted in the message about bars. This inconsistency suggests that maybe the bar is in a different direction. 

Wait, the language observation says ""bars adjacent north, northeast, and northwest."" So from the agent's position (38,15), north is (38,14), which has a bar. Northeast is (39,14), and northwest is (37,14). So those directions are blocked. But pushing east would be to (39,15), which is not one of the adjacent directions mentioned. The adjacent directions for the boulder would be east, southeast, etc. 

Maybe the issue is that the boulder is being pushed into a position where there's a bar. For example, if pushing the boulder east would take it to (39,15), and there's a bar there, then it can't be pushed. But according to the map, (39,15) is a '`', which is floor. 

This is confusing. Perhaps the best approach is to try pushing the boulder east again, assuming the earlier error was due to a misinterpretation of the map. Alternatively, move south to get a clearer path and then push the boulder east when possible. 

Looking at the current state, the agent is at (38,15), and the boulder is at (5,15) relative to the map's line. Wait, no, the map's x and y coordinates might be different. Let me re-express the map:

For y=15, the line is ""#...@{..`#"". Let's index x from 0 to 9:

0: #
1: .
2: .
3: .
4: @
5: {
6: .
7: `
8: #
9: #

So the agent is at x=4, y=15, and the boulder is at x=5, y=15. To push the boulder east, the agent needs to move to x=5, y=15 and then push. Wait, no. To push a boulder, the agent must be adjacent to it and then move in the direction of the push. So if the agent is at (4,15) and the boulder is at (5,15), the agent can push east by moving to (5,15) and then the boulder moves to (6,15). But the agent is already at (4,15), so to push east, they need to be next to the boulder. They are already adjacent. So the correct action should be ""push east"". 

But earlier attempts resulted in the message about bars. This suggests that there's a bar at (6,15), which is preventing the boulder from being moved there. However, the map shows (6,15) as a '.', which is floor. There's a contradiction here. 

Alternatively, the bars mentioned in the language observation are in the direction of the push. The agent's language observation says bars are adjacent north, northeast, and northwest. So when trying to push the boulder east, the path behind the boulder (east direction) might have a bar. If the boulder is at (5,15), pushing east to (6,15) requires that (6,15) is clear. But if there's a bar at (6,15), then the push is blocked. 

Since the map shows (6,15) as '`', which is floor, but the language observation mentions bars very near southeast, south, etc., perhaps the bars are not on the map but are in other areas. This is unclear. 

Given the uncertainty, the best action is to retry pushing east, assuming that the earlier error was due to a different reason, perhaps a mistake in the observation parsing. Alternatively, move south to avoid the bars blocking the north direction and then try pushing the boulder from a different angle. 

Another possibility is that there's another boulder at westnorthwest that needs to be addressed first. But the current goal is to push the boulder east onto the fountain. 

Considering all this, the most plausible action is to attempt to push the boulder east again, as that's the direction towards the fountain. Even if previous attempts failed, maybe there was a temporary block or a misunderstanding. So the action would be ""push east"".

",-0.001,False
92,push east,"<reasoning>
Let's try to figure out what to do here. The agent is in a Boxoban-like game, trying to push boulders onto fountains. The current observation shows the agent (knight) at position (38, 15). The map has a lot of bars and dark areas, which are probably blocking movement. There's a boulder near the east, and a fountain to the eastsoutheast. The agent previously tried pushing the boulder east and south, but the message says ""You cannot pass through the bars,"" so maybe the boulder is blocked by something else, like another obstacle or another boulder.

Looking at the cursor's position and the map, the agent is trying to move east but there are bars adjacent to the east. The boulder is adjacent to the southeast and south. The fountain is adjacent to the east, so maybe the boulder needs to be pushed towards there. But the agent's last attempts to push east or south resulted in errors because of the bars. 

Wait, the latest observation after trying to push east says ""You cannot pass through the bars."" So the boulder might be stuck against a bar or another obstacle. The agent needs to find a way to move the boulder by rearranging their position so that they can push it in the right direction. 

The agent was at (38,15) and tried pushing east, but that's blocked by bars. Maybe moving west a bit to create space? Or perhaps pushing the boulder south instead? Let me check the map again. The map shows a boulder very near westnorthwest, but the agent is currently east of that. Maybe the boulder is in a corner with bars on multiple sides, making it impossible to push. 

Alternatively, the agent might need to use a different direction. Since pushing east isn't working, maybe try pushing south towards the fountain. But the last attempt to push south was also blocked. Or perhaps moving the agent south to a position where they can push the boulder east around the bars. 

Another possibility is that the boulder is already adjacent to the fountain, but the agent's previous attempts to push it there were blocked. The message ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain"" suggests that there's something blocking the boulder's path, maybe another obstacle or another boulder. 

Looking at the language observations, there are bars adjacent to north, northeast, and northwest of the agent. So the agent is surrounded by bars on those sides, making it hard to move the boulder. The agent might need to find a way to move around the bars, but since they're in a maze-like structure with dark areas, it's tricky. 

Perhaps the solution is to move the agent north, but the message says bars are there too. The only open direction seems to be west or south. The agent tried west earlier and is back at (38,15). Maybe pushing the boulder south into the fountain. But how? If the agent is at (38,15), pushing the boulder south would require moving it to (38,16), but there's a fountain adjacent east, which might be the target. 

Wait, the fountain is adjacent east, so maybe the boulder needs to be pushed east into the fountain. But the bars are blocking that path. Unless the agent can move around the bars to position themselves to push the boulder around the corner. 

Alternatively, maybe the boulder is already in a position where pushing it east would work if the agent can get past the bars. But given the multiple bars in the vicinity, it's possible that the boulder is stuck. 

In this case, the agent might need to explore other directions. Since moving east, south, or north is blocked by bars, the only viable option might be to move west again and see if there's a different path. Or try to push the boulder in a different direction, like southwest or southeast. 

But the valid actions are only north, east, south, west, and push in those directions. The agent needs to choose between moving or pushing in one of the four cardinal directions. Given the current obstacles, the best bet might be to move west to (37,15) and try pushing the boulder from there. Or perhaps move south to (38,16) and try pushing east from there. 

However, the agent's previous attempts to push in those directions resulted in failure. Maybe the boulder is trapped between bars and the agent needs to find a way to free it by moving other objects or using items. But the inventory shows a lot of food (apples, carrots) but no tools to break bars. 

Since the agent can't break bars, the only option is to navigate around them. Given the map layout, the agent might need to move west to a position where they can push the boulder south or east around the bars. 

Alternatively, maybe the boulder is already on the fountain, but the observations don't indicate that. The latest observations show the boulder adjacent to southeast and south, which might not be the fountain. 

Given all this, the next logical step is to try pushing the boulder in a different direction. Since pushing east and south didn't work, perhaps pushing southwest or southeast. Wait, the valid actions are only the four directions and their pushes. So the agent can only push north, east, south, or west. 

Looking at the current position, maybe pushing the boulder south into the fountain. The agent is at (38,15), and the fountain is adjacent east. If the boulder is at (39,15), pushing it south to (39,16) might place it near the fountain. But there's a dark area there, which might be a wall or obstacle. 

Alternatively, the agent could move south to (38,16) and then push east. But the bars are still a problem. 

Hmm, this is tricky. The agent needs to find a way to maneuver the boulder around the bars to reach the fountain. Since all direct pushes are blocked, maybe the solution is to move the agent to a position where they can push the boulder around the corner. For example, moving west to (37,15) and then pushing the boulder south to (37,16), which might lead to the fountain. 

But I'm not sure. The agent's previous attempts to move west and push didn't work. Maybe the boulder is stuck between bars and the agent needs to find another approach. 

Alternatively, since the game is turn-based and the agent is allowed to try different actions, perhaps the best move is to keep trying different directions, even if some actions are repeated, as per the tip that avoiding repeated actions if nothing changes. But the agent needs to find a valid path. 

Given the current observations and the fact that pushing east and south is blocked, the next best action might be to move west again and see if pushing the boulder from there works. Or try pushing the boulder north, even though there are bars there. 

Wait, the bars adjacent to the agent's current position are north, northeast, and northwest. So pushing north would be against the bars, which isn't possible. 

So the viable directions are east, south, west. But east and south are blocked by bars. So moving west to (37,15) and then trying to push the boulder south or east from there. 

Alternatively, the agent could try pushing the boulder west, but there's a boulder adjacent to the northwest, which might be blocking. 

This is getting complicated. The agent might need to carefully navigate around the obstacles. Since the tip says not to repeat the same action if nothing changes, the agent should try different directions. 

Given that the last valid action that moved the agent was west to (38,15), and trying to push from there didn't work, maybe the next step is to move south to (38,16) and try pushing east. 

But the agent already tried that and got a message that they couldn't pass through the bars. So maybe the boulder is stuck against a bar or another object. 

In this case, the agent might need to use an item from the inventory to break the bars, but the inventory doesn't have any tools for that. The only items are weapons and armor, which aren't helpful here. 

Therefore, the only option is to navigate around the bars. Since the agent is surrounded on three sides by bars, the only open direction might be south. Moving south to (38,16) and then trying to push the boulder east or south. 

Alternatively, the agent could try pushing the boulder west into the boulder at westnorthwest, but that might not be possible. 

Given all this, the best action the agent can take is to move south to (38,16) and attempt to push the boulder east from there, hoping that the bars are not in that direction. 

So the chosen action would be ""push east"".

",-0.001,False
93,shoot north,"<reasoning>
Let me try to figure out what the agent needs to do next. The goal is to push the boulder onto the fountain. From the observations, there's a boulder near the east, and the fountain is in the eastsoutheast area. The agent's current position is (38, 15).

Looking at the map, the agent is facing north with bars blocking that path. The boulder is adjacent to the southeast, so maybe moving east or south could help. The problem is that the agent tried pushing south and east before but got messages saying they can't pass through bars. Maybe the bars are blocking the way even when trying to push the boulder.

Wait, the previous attempts to push south or east resulted in the error ""You cannot pass through the bars."" That suggests that there's a bar in the direction the boulder is being pushed. So perhaps the boulder is against a bar or another obstacle that's blocking its path to the fountain. 

The agent needs to reposition themselves so that they can push the boulder in a direction that's not blocked by bars. Let's check the adjacent areas. To the east of the agent is a boulder, but pushing it east might be blocked by another bar. If the agent moves south first, maybe they can get around the blockage. 

Alternatively, moving west might allow the agent to approach the boulder from another angle. But looking at the language observations, the boulder is adjacent southeast and northwest. The agent is at (38,15), so southeast would be (39,16), which is where the boulder is. If the agent moves east to (39,15), then tries to push the boulder south, maybe that could work. But the previous attempt to push east was invalid because of bars.

Wait, the latest observation still shows the boulder very near eastsoutheast. So the fountain is there. The agent needs to get the boulder closer. Let me check the bars' positions. The bars are adjacent north, northeast, and northwest of the agent. So moving north is blocked, but maybe moving south or west could clear a path.

If the agent moves south to (38,16), then perhaps they can position themselves to push the boulder east towards the fountain. But the map shows that moving south might lead into another bar. The message when trying to push south before was ""You cannot pass through the bars,"" which implies that the direction is blocked. 

Alternatively, the agent could try to move west to (37,15) and then see if pushing the boulder east from there. But the boulder is already near east. Hmm. Maybe the agent needs to find a way to navigate around the bars to get a clear path to push the boulder towards the fountain.

Another angle: the stairs up are near westsouthwest, so maybe there's a way to go around the bars by moving west, but the dark area is in the southwest. Alternatively, the agent could try to use the sword or another item in the inventory, but the task is to push the boulder, not attack.

Looking back, the agent tried several directions but kept hitting bars. The key is to find a direction where pushing the boulder won't hit a bar. Since the boulder is adjacent southeast, pushing it east might be possible if there's no bar there. But the latest language observation says the boulder is adjacent southeast and south. So pushing it south might be blocked by a bar.

Wait, the bars adjacent are north, northeast, and northwest. The boulder is at (39,15) or nearby. If the agent is at (38,15), the boulder to the east (39,15) is adjacent. If the agent moves east to (39,15), then tries to push the boulder south to (39,16), but the bars very near include south, so that might be blocked. 

Alternatively, pushing the boulder east towards the fountain. The fountain is very near east, so if the boulder can be moved east, it would reach the fountain. But the bars near east might block that. The language observation says ""bars near north, northnortheast, northeast, eastnortheast, eastsoutheast, westsouthwest, westnorthwest, and northnorthwest."" So the eastern direction might have bars as well.

This is tricky. The agent might need to reposition to a spot where pushing the boulder in a direction without bars is possible. Maybe moving west to (37,15) and then trying to push the boulder east. But the boulder is already east of the agent. Wait, the agent is at (38,15), and the boulder is at (39,15). So from the agent's position, east is the boulder. If the agent moves east to (39,15), then they can push the boulder south or east. But pushing east from there might lead into a bar.

Another thought: the stairs up are near westsouthwest, so maybe moving west and then south could open up a path. But the agent tried west before and the boulder is there. Alternatively, maybe the agent should try to move south to (38,16) and then see if pushing the boulder east from there is possible. However, the map shows that moving south from (38,15) might hit a bar or a dark area.

Given the previous invalid actions, the agent needs to avoid pushing in directions blocked by bars. The only valid direction might be to move west or try to find a clear path. Alternatively, the agent could use the lance or another weapon, but the task is to push, not attack.

After several failed attempts to push, the best course might be to move around the boulder to a position where pushing it towards the fountain is possible. Since the boulder is to the east, moving west to (37,15) allows the agent to approach from the west, then push the boulder east towards the fountain. But the agent's last position was (38,15) after moving west. From there, pushing the boulder east to (39,15) might be possible if there's no bar there.

Wait, the latest language observation says ""boulder adjacent southeast and south."" So the boulder at (39,15) is adjacent to southeast (which would be (40,16)) and south (40,15). If the agent is at (38,15), pushing the boulder east to (39,15) is already there, so maybe the agent needs to push it further east. But the bars very near include east, so that might be blocked.

Alternatively, pushing the boulder south from (39,15) to (39,16), but the bars are adjacent south, so that's blocked. Hmm. 

The agent might need to find a way to get the boulder into the fountain by navigating around the bars. Since the fountain is in the eastsoutheast, maybe pushing the boulder southeast. But to do that, the agent needs to be adjacent to the boulder in that direction. 

Alternatively, the agent could move south to (38,16) and then try to push the boulder east. But the bars very near include south, so moving south might hit a bar. 

This is quite challenging. Given the previous invalid actions, perhaps the best bet is to try moving west again to (37,15) and then see if pushing the boulder east from there is possible. But since the agent was at (38,15) and moved west to (37,15), then trying to push the boulder east to (38,15) which is where the agent is, that wouldn't move the boulder. 

Wait, the boulder is at (39,15). From (37,15), the agent could push the boulder east twice? No, because each push moves it one tile. So if the agent is at (37,15), pushing the boulder east would move it to (38,15), which is where the agent is. That's not helpful. 

Maybe the agent needs to move south to (38,16) and then try to push the boulder east. But the bars in the south direction might block that. 

Another angle: the agent's inventory has a +1 long sword and a lance. Maybe using the lance to attack obstacles, but the problem requires pushing the boulder, not attacking. 

Given the constraints and the previous attempts, the only valid action that might work is to move west and then try to push the boulder east. Alternatively, the agent could try to push the boulder south if that path is clear. 

But based on the latest observations, the bars adjacent are north, northeast, and northwest, so pushing south from the boulder's position (39,15) would be to (39,16), which is blocked by bars. Therefore, the only possible direction is east, but that's blocked by bars as well. 

This seems like a dead end. Perhaps the agent needs to explore other areas to find a way around the bars. For example, moving west to the stairs up area (westsouthwest) might provide a different path. 

The stairs up are near westsouthwest, so moving west to (37,15) and then south to (37,16) might lead to an open area. From there, the agent could attempt to push the boulder east. 

But the agent's current position is (38,15), and moving west to (37,15) is possible. Then moving south to (37,16). Checking the bars in that direction: the bars very near include south, so moving south from (37,15) might hit a bar. 

Alternatively, moving west to (37,15), then north to (37,14), but that's blocked by bars adjacent north. 

This is really perplexing. Given the repeated failures to push due to bars, the agent might need to find a different strategy. Maybe using the inventory items to remove obstacles, but the inventory only has apples, carrots, and armor. 

Wait, the agent has a blessed +1 lance. Could that be used to break bars? In MiniHack, certain items can destroy bars. For example, a shooting action with a crossbow or lance might break bars. However, the agent hasn't used any projectile actions yet. 

If the agent can shoot the bars blocking the path, that might clear a way to push the boulder. But the problem is that the goal is to push the boulder, not attack. However, using the lance to break a bar could allow the agent to proceed. 

The agent's inventory includes a blessed +1 lance, which is wielded as an alternate weapon. To shoot, the action would be 'shoot north' or similar. If the agent shoots a bar in the path, it might break, allowing the boulder to be pushed. 

For example, if the agent is at (38,15) and there's a bar to the north, shooting north with the lance might break it. Then the agent could move north and push the boulder. 

This could be a viable strategy. The agent hasn't tried shooting yet, so this might be the way forward. 

So the next action could be to shoot north, which is the direction of the bars. If successful, the bars would be removed, allowing the agent to move or push the boulder. 

Therefore, the chosen action would be to shoot north.

Let's see what's going on here. The agent is in a Boxoban-like game, trying to push boulders onto fountains. The current position is at (38, 15), looking at the map. There are bars blocking movement north, northeast, and northwest. The boulders are nearby, specifically east and westnorthwest. The fountains are to the eastsoutheast.

The agent tried several push actions before but kept getting errors because of bars in the way. Now, the latest invalid action was ""shoot north,"" which defaulted to north. The message says bars are blocking the north path.

So, the main goal is to get the boulder to the fountain. The boulder to the east is adjacent, but the agent tried pushing east and got a message that they couldn't move the boulder, possibly because there's a bar behind it or the boulder is at a dead end. Alternatively, maybe the boulder is stuck between bars and the fountain isn't reachable directly.

Looking at the map, the agent is at (38,15). The boulder is very near east, so maybe it's right next to the agent. If the boulder is adjacent, pushing east should work if there's space behind. But the message said ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain,"" which might mean there's an obstacle behind the boulder. Check the bars' positions. There are bars adjacent to the boulder's southeast and south, so pushing east might not be possible because behind the boulder (east) is blocked by bars or the map edge.

Alternatively, the other boulder is at westnorthwest. Maybe that's a better target. To reach it, the agent would need to move west or north, but bars are blocking those directions. So the agent might be stuck between bars and boulders.

Another thought: perhaps the agent needs to reposition themselves to get a clear path to push the boulder. Since moving north is blocked by bars, maybe moving south could create an opening. Or check if there's a dark area that's passable. The dark areas are mentioned in the observations, but they might be obstacles as well.

The inventory has a lance, which could be used to shoot. Maybe shooting at the bars to remove them? But shooting north where the bars are might break them. Let's check the message when shooting north. If the bars are destructible, shooting them could clear the path. The agent's previous attempt to shoot north was invalid, but maybe that's because the action wasn't correctly formatted. The correct action would be ""shoot north"" if the lance is available. However, the agent's inventory shows a blessed +1 lance, which is a ranged weapon. So using it to break bars could be a valid strategy.

Wait, but the agent's previous attempt to ""shoot north"" was invalid, possibly due to syntax. The correct format is ""shoot north"". The error message said the action wasn't valid, so maybe the agent needs to retry the shoot action properly. Let's confirm the possible actions. The allowed actions are north, east, south, west, and push direction. Also, shoot direction could be an action if the agent has a projectile or ranged weapon. Since the agent has a lance, shooting is a valid action.

So, the plan is: use the lance to shoot the bars blocking the north path. If successful, the bars break, allowing the agent to move north and potentially reposition to push the boulder. Let's try ""shoot north"" again, correctly formatted.

Let's see. The agent needs to solve Boxoban, which is pushing boulders onto fountains. The current position is (38,15). The map shows some bars, dark areas, and a boulder adjacent to the southeast and south.

Looking at the language observations, there's a boulder very near east and northnorthwest. The fountains are near eastsoutheast and very near eastnortheast. The agent tried pushing east and south before but hit bars. Maybe the boulder is stuck behind an obstacle.

The agent's inventory has a long sword and a lance. Shooting north might not be effective if there's a bar blocking the path. The best approach might be to navigate around the boulder. Since the boulder is adjacent to the southeast, maybe moving west or north could allow pushing it towards the fountain.

Wait, the fountain is very near eastnortheast. The boulder at eastnortheast needs to be moved there. The agent is currently at (38,15). To reach the boulder at eastnortheast, maybe move east first, but earlier attempts resulted in messages about unable to pass bars. Perhaps the bars are in the way, so need to find another path.

Alternatively, the agent could try pushing the boulder south or west. If the boulder is at east, pushing it south might move it towards the fountain. But the last attempt to push south was invalid. Maybe the path is blocked by bars or other obstacles.

Looking at the map, there's a fountain at (eastnortheast). The boulder is very near east and northnorthwest. If the agent can get next to the boulder and push it south or east towards the fountain, that would solve the level. But movement is restricted by bars and dark areas.

The agent's last valid action was 'east', moving to (39,15). Then tried pushing east again but failed. Maybe the boulder is against a wall or bars. The agent should check the adjacent cells. Since the boulder is adjacent southeast and south, perhaps the agent needs to position themselves to push it in the right direction.

If the boulder is at (39,16) southeast, pushing it south would move it to (39,17), but the fountain is at (eastnortheast), which might be a different coordinate. Maybe the agent needs to move northeast towards the fountain. However, the bars are far north, so navigation is tricky.

Alternatively, the agent could use the lance to shoot the boulder if it's within range, but that might not be the intended solution. The primary method in Boxoban is pushing boulders, not shooting. So the best bet is to find a path to the boulder and push it towards the fountain.

Given the current position (38,15), moving west to (37,15) might allow accessing the boulder at northnorthwest. Then push it east towards the fountain. But the agent tried moving west before and the message was about moving the boulder but in vain, which might mean the boulder is blocked.

Alternatively, since the boulder is adjacent southeast, maybe moving south to (38,16) and then pushing east. But need to check if there's a clear path. The map shows some bars adjacent to the southeast, so pushing might not be possible.

The agent needs to carefully navigate around obstacles. Maybe moving north to (38,14) if possible, but the bars are very near north. It's possible that the only way is to find a corridor between the bars and navigate to the boulder.

Alternatively, since the stairs are up near westsouthwest, maybe descending stairs could help, but the current level is 1. The agent should focus on the current level.

In summary, the agent should try to reach the boulder at eastnortheast, push it towards the fountain at eastsoutheast. The best action might be to move east again, but considering the previous failure, perhaps adjusting direction. Maybe move south to (38,16) and then east to get next to the boulder. However, the bars are blocking movement. Alternatively, use the weapon to shoot if that's a valid action, but pushing is the primary method.

Given the constraints, the next action should be to push the boulder in a valid direction. Since the boulder is adjacent southeast, pushing it south might work if there's space. The agent is at (38,15), and the boulder is southeast, so perhaps (39,16). Pushing south from there would move it to (39,17). If that's a valid space (not a wall or bar), then that's the action. But the agent's current position is (38,15), so to push the boulder at southeast, need to be adjacent. Maybe the agent should move east to (39,15) and then push south.

Wait, the boulder is adjacent southeast, meaning it's to the southeast of the agent's current position. So the agent is at (38,15), and the boulder is at (39,16). To push it south, the agent needs to be north of the boulder. So move east to (39,15), then move south to (39,16) to be adjacent, then push south. But the agent tried pushing east before and got a message about bars. Maybe the path is blocked.

Alternatively, the agent could move north to (38,14) if possible, but the bars are very near north. It's risky. The safest bet is to try pushing the boulder again in a direction where there's a clear path to the fountain. Given the fountain is at eastsoutheast, pushing the boulder east or southeast might be the way. But need to ensure there's no obstacle behind the boulder when pushing.

Since the agent can't see the exact map layout beyond the language observations, relying on the coordinates and adjacent cells. The final action should be to push the boulder east or south towards the fountain, assuming the path is clear.

Let's see. I need to navigate this Boxoban level. The goal is to push the boulders onto the fountains. The agent is a knight at position (38,15). Looking at the map, there's a boulder adjacent to the southeast and south. The fountains are very near eastsoutheast.

First, the previous attempts to push east or south didn't work because of bars blocking the way. The message says ""You cannot pass through the bars,"" so those directions are blocked by obstacles like walls or bars. The agent is surrounded by bars to the north, northeast, and northwest. 

The boulder is to the southeast. Maybe I need to move towards it. But the agent is already at (38,15). Moving south would take them to (38,16), but the map shows that the cursor is at y=15. Let me check the map again. The map's exact layout isn't fully visible here, but the observations mention a boulder adjacent southeast and south. 

Since pushing east or south isn't working due to bars, perhaps moving west could allow access to the boulder. Wait, the agent was previously at (38,15) after moving east, then tried pushing which failed. Now, moving west back to (37,15) might be possible. From there, maybe they can move south or east again.

Alternatively, the boulder is to the southeast. If the agent moves south to (38,16), they might be able to position themselves to push the boulder east into the fountain. But the bars are still a problem. The agent needs to find a path around the bars to reach the boulder.

Looking at the language observations, there's a fountain very near eastsoutheast. The boulder is very near westnorthwest. So the boulder is on the opposite side of the agent. Maybe the agent needs to go around the bars to the west or north to reach the boulder. However, the stairs are up near westsouthwest, which might be a dead end.

Alternatively, since the boulder is adjacent south and southeast, perhaps the agent can push it south into the fountain. But the agent is already at y=15. Moving south to y=16 might allow pushing the boulder further south. But the observation says ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain"" when they tried pushing south before. Maybe there's something blocking behind the boulder. Wait, the boulder can only be pushed if there's space behind it. If pushing south doesn't work, maybe the boulder is blocked by another obstacle or a wall.

Another approach: check the inventory. The agent has a sword, lance, shield, etc. Maybe using a projectile weapon like the lance could help, but that's risky and might not be effective here. The priority is to push the boulder using movement.

Given the barriers, the agent might need to move west to get around the north barriers. From (38,15), moving west to (37,15) could clear the path north. Then, move north to get past the bars, then east towards the boulder. But the stairs are up at westsouthwest, so maybe that's not useful.

Alternatively, the agent could try to move south to (38,16) and then east to (39,16), but the map shows that the east direction near there has bars. 

Wait, the fountain is at eastsoutheast, which is probably near (39,16) or similar. The boulder is at westnorthwest, so maybe the agent needs to go around to the other side. This is getting confusing. Let's try to outline possible steps:

1. Move west to (37,15) to avoid the northern bars.
2. Move north to (37,14), but need to check if there's a path.
3. From (37,14), move east towards the boulder at westnorthwest. But how?

Alternatively, since the boulder is adjacent southeast and south from the agent's current position, maybe the agent is north of the boulder. So pushing the boulder south would move it towards the fountain. But why didn't it work before? Maybe there's a wall behind the boulder. The agent needs to ensure there's space behind the boulder when pushing.

Perhaps the agent needs to move in a different direction to position themselves correctly. Let's try moving south once more, then see if pushing the boulder east or south is possible. If moving south to (38,16) and then trying to push east into the fountain, which is nearby. But the map shows the fountain is very near eastsoutheast, so maybe (39,16) is the fountain. If the boulder is at (38,15) and the agent is at (38,15), pushing east to (39,15) might not reach the fountain. The fountain is at eastsoutheast, which is further east and south.

This is getting complicated. Maybe the best action is to move west to (37,15) and then try a different approach. Alternatively, since pushing east and south are blocked by bars, moving north might be possible if there's a path. The agent needs to check the map for clear paths.

Looking at the map description, there are a lot of ########## which likely represent walls or barriers. The agent is in a corridor that's blocked on the north, northeast, and northwest sides. The only open directions might be east and south, but those are blocked by boulders or bars. 

Wait, the previous actions tried pushing east and south, but those failed because of the boulders or bars. The agent needs to find a way to move around the boulder. If the boulder is adjacent southeast, maybe moving south and then east could work. But the agent tried pushing south before and it didn't work. 

Alternatively, the agent could use the lance to shoot the boulder, but that's not a movement action and might not be effective. The priority is to physically push the boulder. 

Given the current position and the barriers, the only viable movement might be west or north. Moving west to (37,15) and then checking if there's a path north. If the agent moves west and then north, they might exit the bar-lined area and reach the boulder at westnorthwest. 

Once past the bars, the agent could then move east towards the boulder and push it into the fountain. But this requires navigating through the maze of bars and dark areas. 

In summary, the agent should move west to avoid the northern bars, then find a path north or east to reach the boulder. Since previous attempts to push didn't work, directional movement is needed first.

Let's try to figure out what to do next in this Boxoban level. The agent is a knight positioned at (37, 15), looking at a map with various obstacles, boulders, and fountains. The goal is to push all the boulders onto the fountains.

First, looking at the observations, there's a boulder very near eastsoutheast, and a fountain very near east. So, the immediate goal is probably to move that boulder onto the fountain. The agent's current position is (37,15), and the boulder is nearby. 

The previous actions tried pushing east or south, but those resulted in errors because of bars blocking the way. The bars are in the way, so the agent needs to navigate around them to reach the boulder. The stairs up are to the westsouthwest, but maybe that's not immediately useful.

Looking at the map, the agent's current position is marked with @, and the boulder is represented by {. The fountain is at eastsoutheast. The bars are blocking direct movement east, so the agent needs to go around. The last valid position before getting stuck was (38,15) when moving east, but pushing further east was blocked by bars. 

Perhaps moving south could clear a path. If the agent moves south, they might find a space to push the boulder east into the fountain. Alternatively, moving west might let them reposition to push the boulder from another angle. However, moving west from (37,15) would take them back to (36,15), which might be blocked by bars as observed earlier.

Another approach is to check if there's a way to move north around the bars. The bars are far north, but maybe there's a path. However, moving north from (37,15) might hit the bars again. 

The key is to get around the bars to access the boulder. Since pushing east isn't working due to bars, maybe moving south first to see if that opens up a path. Once clear, the agent can then move east to push the boulder onto the fountain. 

Alternatively, using the inventory items might help. The agent has a long sword and a lance. But in Boxoban, using weapons for pushing isn't typically allowed; pushing boulders requires moving them with the body. So, attacking isn't useful here. 

The stairs up are near westsouthwest, but unless the goal requires going up, it's probably not necessary right now. The priority is to manipulate the boulder onto the fountain. 

So, the plan is: move south to avoid the bars, then east to reach the boulder, and push it east into the fountain. Let's check the coordinates. From (37,15), moving south to (37,16), then east to (38,16), and push the boulder east to (39,16), which should be the fountain's location. 

But need to ensure there's no obstacle in between. According to the map, the area near eastsoutheast has the fountain, so pushing the boulder there would solve the level. 

Therefore, the next action should be to move south to create space, then adjust direction to push the boulder east. The first valid move after getting stuck was moving west back to (38,15), but that didn't help. Maybe moving south first. Let's try moving south now.

Let's try to figure out what to do here. The goal is to push the boulders onto the fountains in Boxoban.

First, looking at the current observation. The agent is at (37,16). The map shows some bars and dark areas around. There's a boulder adjacent to the east, and a fountain very near eastnortheast. The agent's inventory has a long sword, a lance, some armor, and food. But since the goal is moving boulders, maybe using the sword isn't necessary here. 

The previous actions tried pushing east and south, but there were either bars or obstacles. The last valid move was moving west to (37,15). Now, the cursor is at (37,16), and the boulder is adjacent to the east. So maybe the agent needs to move east again to push the boulder. 

But earlier attempts to push east resulted in messages saying ""You cannot pass through the bars."" Wait, the language observation mentions bars adjacent to southeast, south, and southwest. Maybe the agent is near a bar that's blocking the path. However, the boulder is to the east. If the agent moves east, they might be able to push the boulder if there's space behind it. 

Looking at the map, the line for y=15 has `#<..``{.{#` which might indicate the boulder ({) near the east. At y=16, the line is `#....{..`#`, so maybe the boulder is still there. The agent is at (37,16). If they move east to (38,16), they might be able to push the boulder south or east. But the fountain is eastnortheast, so maybe pushing the boulder east towards the fountain would work. 

However, the previous attempts to push east failed because of bars. Wait, the bars adjacent are southeast, south, southwest. So when the agent is at (37,16), moving east to (38,16) might be blocked by a bar. But the boulder is at (38,15) perhaps? Or maybe the bars are in the way. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent should move south to get around the bars and then approach the boulder. From (37,16), moving south to (37,17) could be possible if there's no obstacle. Then, they could move east to get next to the boulder and push it towards the fountain. 

The stairs are up at westsouthwest, which might not be relevant right now. The priority is to get the boulder to the fountain. The fountain is very near eastnortheast, so pushing the boulder east or northeast would be the way to go. 

Another thing to note is that the boulder is adjacent southeast and south. So if the agent is at (37,16), moving east would place them next to the boulder. But if there's a bar in the way, they can't push it. So maybe the agent needs to first move around the bars. 

Looking at the map again, the agent is at (37,16). The map row for y=16 is `#....{..`#`. The `{` is the boulder at position (38,16). So the agent is at (37,16), east is (38,16) which has the boulder. To push the boulder east, the agent needs to be adjacent to it and there should be no obstacle behind. But the message says ""You cannot pass through the bars"" when trying to push east. That suggests there's a bar in the direction the boulder is being pushed. 

The bars adjacent are southeast, south, southwest. So if the agent is trying to push the boulder east (to (39,16)), but there's a bar at (39,16), that would block it. Or maybe the bar is at (38,16) which is the boulder's current position. Wait, bars are separate from boulders. The bars are in the environment, so the agent needs to find a path around them. 

Perhaps the best approach is to move south to (37,17) to avoid the bars and then approach the boulder from another direction. Alternatively, move west to (36,16) and then try pushing the boulder east. 

But the agent already tried moving west and south previously. Let's check the latest observation after moving west to (37,15), then south to (37,16). Now, the boulder is adjacent east. So if the agent moves east to (38,16), they can try pushing the boulder. But the problem is the bars. Maybe the bars are north of the boulder, preventing it from being pushed further north. 

Alternatively, the agent could move south to (37,17) and then try pushing the boulder east-southeast towards the fountain. 

Another idea: since the fountain is eastnortheast, maybe pushing the boulder in that direction. To do that, the agent might need to move northeast, but the map has bars in the northeast direction. 

Alternatively, use the lance to shoot something, but that might not be necessary. The agent's inventory has a lance, but shooting might not help in pushing boulders. 

Considering all this, the most logical next step is to try pushing the boulder east again, even if it failed before, perhaps because of a different barrier. Alternatively, move around the bars to find a path. 

Wait, the latest message after trying to push east was ""You cannot pass through the bars."" So the bars are blocking the path where the boulder is being pushed. The agent needs to find a way to position the boulder so that there's no bar behind it when pushing. 

Maybe the agent should move south to get clear of the bars and then approach the boulder from the south. For example, move from (37,16) to (37,17), then east to (38,17), and then push the boulder south or east. 

But the map's y=17 row isn't shown, so it's hard to tell. Alternatively, check if moving west again and then north or south could help. 

Another possibility is that the boulder is stuck between bars, so the agent needs to move it in a different direction. Since the fountain is eastnortheast, pushing the boulder east first, then north or northeast might work. 

But given the previous failures, maybe the correct action is to move south to (37,17) and then try pushing the boulder east from there. 

Alternatively, since the agent is at (37,16) and the boulder is at (38,16), moving east to (38,16) and then pushing south towards the fountain. 

Wait, the fountain is very near eastnortheast, which might be at (39,17) or similar. If the agent pushes the boulder east to (39,16), then maybe they can push it north or northeast into the fountain. 

But without knowing the exact positions of the fountain, it's a bit tricky. The language observation says the fountain is very near eastnortheast, so perhaps (39,17). 

In any case, the immediate action should be to try pushing the boulder in a direction that leads it towards the fountain, avoiding bars. The latest valid position of the agent is (37,16), and the boulder is at (38,16). So moving east to (38,16) and then pushing east again towards (39,16) might be possible if there's no bar there. 

But the previous attempts to push east resulted in bar messages. Maybe the bar is at (39,16), blocking the path. In that case, the agent needs to find another way. 

Alternatively, move south to (37,17), then east to (38,17), and push the boulder south to (38,16), which is already where it is. That doesn't help. 

Hmm. Maybe the agent should try pushing the boulder south. From (38,16), pushing south to (38,17). If there's no bar there, that could work. 

So the agent's current position is (37,16). Move east to (38,16) to be next to the boulder, then push south to (38,17). 

But the problem is whether there's a bar at (38,17). The language observation mentions bars adjacent to southeast, south, southwest from the agent's current position (37,16). So (38,17) would be southeast, which might have a bar. 

This is getting complicated. Maybe the best action is to move south to (37,17) and then try pushing the boulder east from there. 

Alternatively, check the map again. The map at y=16 is `#....{..`#`, so the boulder is at (38,16). The agent is at (37,16). To push the boulder east, they need to move to (38,16) and then push east to (39,16). If there's a bar at (39,16), pushing is impossible. 

The language observation says bars are adjacent to southeast, south, southwest from (37,16). So (38,17) is southeast, which has a bar. Therefore, pushing the boulder east to (39,16) might be blocked by a bar at (39,16) or (38,17). 

In that case, the agent cannot push the boulder east directly. Maybe they need to move the boulder south first. From (38,16), pushing south to (38,17). But if (38,17) has a bar, that's not possible. 

Alternatively, the agent could move west to (36,16), then north or south to find a path. 

But given the time constraints and the need to avoid repeating actions, the best bet is to try pushing the boulder in a direction that's not blocked by bars. Since pushing east failed before, maybe pushing south is an option. 

So, the agent should move east to (38,16) and then push south to (38,17). If that's possible, then the boulder would be moved towards the fountain area. 

Therefore, the chosen action is to push south.

Let me try to figure out what the best move here is. The agent is in a Boxoban-like environment, trying to push boulders onto fountains. Let's look at the current observation.

The cursor is at (37, 15). The map shows some bars and dark areas around. There's a boulder adjacent to the southeast and northwest. The fountains are near east and eastsoutheast. The agent's inventory includes weapons and armor but no keys, which might not be needed here.

The previous attempts to push east or south didn't work because of bars or obstacles. The latest valid action was moving west to (37,15), then south to (37,16). Now, the agent needs to navigate around the bars and move the boulder onto the fountain.

Looking at the map, there's a boulder near eastsoutheast. The fountain is very near there. The agent is at (37,15). To reach the boulder, maybe move east. But the message said earlier that pushing east wasn't possible due to bars. Wait, the language observation mentions bars adjacent north and northeast. So moving north or northeast would hit bars. 

The boulder is adjacent southeast and northwest. If the agent moves southeast, perhaps they can push the boulder towards the fountain. But the current position is (37,15). Moving east to (38,15) might be possible if there's no barrier. Let me check the map again. The map shows at (38,15) there's a `<..``{.{#`, which might be a boulder or obstacle. 

Wait, the map row for y=15 has `#..@.{..`#` at x=37, and the next cell (x=38, y=15) is `<..``{.{#`. The `<` might indicate the boulder, and `{` could be a fountain or another obstacle. So pushing the boulder east from (38,15) to (39,15) might place it on the fountain. But the agent is currently at (37,15). To reach the boulder at (38,15), the agent needs to move east first. 

However, the previous attempt to push east resulted in an error because of bars. Maybe the bars are in the way. Alternatively, the agent should move around to the side of the boulder. If the boulder is at (38,15) and the fountain is at eastsoutheast, perhaps moving the boulder south or east. 

Alternatively, since the agent is at (37,15), moving south to (37,16) where there's a `<.@``{.{#`. The `<` here might be another boulder. If the agent can push that one south or east, it might reach the fountain. 

But the immediate goal is to get the boulder onto the fountain. The fountain is adjacent east, so maybe pushing the boulder east would work. The agent needs to get next to the boulder. If the boulder is at (38,15), the agent can move east to (38,15) and then push it east to (39,15), which is adjacent to the fountain. 

But the problem is that the previous attempts to push east resulted in the action being defaulted to north because of invalid commands. So maybe the correct action is to first move east to get next to the boulder, then push east. 

Looking at the latest valid action was moving south to (37,16). Now, from (37,16), the agent can try to move east. The map at (38,16) is `#<..``{.{#`, so the `<` is a boulder. If the agent moves east to (38,16), they can then push it east towards the fountain. 

So the sequence would be: east to (38,16), then push east to (39,16), placing the boulder on the fountain. But need to confirm if that's possible. Also, check if there are obstacles in between. 

Alternatively, from (37,15), move south to (37,16), then east to (38,16), then push east. That could work. 

But the agent needs to output a single action. So the best immediate action is to move east from (37,15) to (38,15), where the boulder is located, and then push it east. However, moving east might not be possible if there's a bar or another obstacle. 

Looking at the language observation, bars are adjacent north and northeast. So moving north or northeast is blocked. Moving east might be possible if there's no bar. The map shows at (38,15) a `<`, which is the boulder. So moving east to (38,15) is possible, and then pushing it east. 

Therefore, the correct action would be to push east from (38,15) to (39,15), which is the fountain. But to do that, the agent first needs to move east to get next to the boulder. 

Wait, the agent is currently at (37,15). The boulder is at (38,15). So the agent can move east to (38,15) and then push east. Therefore, the first action should be ""east"" to reach the boulder, then ""push east"". But since the agent can only output one action at a time, the immediate action is to move east. 

However, in the previous steps, moving east resulted in the action being defaulted to north because of invalid commands. Maybe the correct format for pushing is different. In MiniHack, pushing is done by specifying the direction, like ""push east"". 

Given that, the agent should try to push the boulder east. So the action would be ""push east"". But need to ensure that the agent is adjacent to the boulder. Since the agent is at (37,15) and the boulder is at (38,15), moving east first is necessary. But if the agent can't move east due to bars, then they need to find another path. 

Looking at the language observation, bars are very near north, northeast, etc., but east is adjacent to the boulder, not a bar. So moving east should be possible. 

Therefore, the correct action is to push east, which would move the boulder from (38,15) to (39,15), placing it on the fountain at eastsoutheast. 

So the final action should be ""push east"".
