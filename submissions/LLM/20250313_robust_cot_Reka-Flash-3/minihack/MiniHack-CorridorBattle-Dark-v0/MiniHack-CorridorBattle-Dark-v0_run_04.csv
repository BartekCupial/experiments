Let's see. The agent is starting in NetHack as a lawful female Knight. The goal is to explore the level and reach the stairs down. The current observation shows the agent's position at (24,13). The map isn't fully explored yet, but there are some features mentioned.

First, the message says ""dark area very near north, northeast, east, west, and northwest."" So those directions are likely unexplored or have walls. The horizontal walls are adjacent to the southeast, south, and southwest. That suggests that moving south, southwest, or southeast might hit walls. 

The agent is holding a +1 long sword and has a lance as an alternate weapon. Armor is ring mail, helmet, shield, gloves. Health and power are okay. Inventory has food (apples and carrots), which is good for sustenance. 

Looking at the map, the agent's position is marked with @. The surrounding area: north, northeast, east, west, northwest are dark, so probably not visible yet. The south, southeast, and southwest have horizontal walls. So moving south would hit a wall. Similarly, southeast and southwest are adjacent to walls. 

So possible movement directions that aren't walls or dark areas: maybe west or northwest? Wait, the dark areas are very near north, northeast, east, west, and northwest. So moving west or northwest might still be dark. But maybe the agent can start by exploring adjacent squares that are visible. 

But given the walls to the south, southeast, and southwest, the agent can't move in those directions without hitting a wall. So possible moves are north, northeast, east, west, northwest. But all those directions are dark except maybe some. Wait, the dark area is very near those directions, meaning those squares are adjacent but not yet explored. 

Since the agent is at (24,13), let's look at possible moves. Let's think: maybe moving east first to see if there's a path. But east is dark. Alternatively, moving north. The cursor's position is (24,13), so moving north would take the agent to (24,12). But the map shows that at (24,12), it's a dark area. So perhaps the agent should pick a direction that's not immediately blocked by walls or dark areas. 

Wait, the horizontal walls are adjacent to southeast, south, and southwest. So if the agent is at (24,13), moving south would go to (24,14), which is a wall. Southeast to (25,14) is a wall. Southwest to (23,14) is a wall. So those directions are blocked. 

So the possible safe moves are north, northeast, northwest, or west. Let's check those. North is (24,12), which is dark. Northeast is (25,12), also dark. West is (23,13), which is dark. Northwest is (23,12), dark. All those directions are dark except maybe the ones with walls. 

But since the agent's goal is to explore, perhaps the best first step is to move in a direction that isn't blocked. Wait, maybe moving north is possible but dark. Alternatively, maybe the agent should try to pick a direction that's not immediately blocked. 

Alternatively, since the agent has food, maybe the first step is to move in a safe direction. For example, moving west to (23,13), which is dark. But maybe that's a corridor. Or moving northwest to (23,12), which is dark. Alternatively, moving northeast to (25,12), which is dark. 

Alternatively, perhaps the agent should try to move in a direction that's not blocked and explore. But given the walls, perhaps moving north is the only non-wall direction that's not dark. Wait, but the dark areas are very near, meaning those squares are not yet mapped. So maybe moving north into the dark area is the way to proceed. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent should check if there's a staircase nearby. But the initial observation doesn't mention stairs, so the agent is on level 1. The goal is to reach the stairs down, which is likely somewhere in the level. 

So the first step is probably to explore a direction. Since moving south is blocked by a wall, the agent should avoid that. So possible moves: north, northeast, east, west, northwest. All of these are dark except maybe the walls. 

Wait, the agent's current position is (24,13). The map shows that to the south, southwest, and southeast there are horizontal walls. So moving south would hit a wall. So the agent can't go south. 

So the agent needs to explore the other directions. Let's pick a direction. Maybe north first. Moving north to (24,12), which is dark. But since the agent hasn't explored there yet, moving there would expand the map. Alternatively, moving west to (23,13). 

Alternatively, maybe moving northeast to (25,12). But that's also dark. 

Alternatively, the agent could try to move west and then north. But perhaps the best first step is to move in a direction that allows exploration. Let's choose to move north. 

But the agent should avoid moving into the same direction repeatedly. However, since this is the first step, any direction is new. 

Alternatively, perhaps the agent should check if there's a way to move that's not blocked. But given the walls in the south and adjacent areas, the only possible moves are north, northeast, east, west, northwest. All dark. 

So the agent's first action should be to move in one of those directions, preferably north or west. Let's pick north. 

So the chosen action is north.

The agent is on level 1 of the dungeon. The goal is to reach the stairs down. Looking at the current observation, the stairs up are adjacent to the south. The agent is at position (24,12) and the stairs up are south. But our goal is the stairs down, which isn't mentioned here yet. The map shows stairs up as '<' south of the agent.

First, I need to figure out where the stairs down are. Since this is level 1, maybe the stairs down are somewhere else on the map. The agent needs to explore the area. From the previous step, moving north was taken, and now the agent is at (24,12). The dark areas are in all directions except south where the stairs up are. There's a horizontal wall very near south, so moving south into the wall isn't possible.

The tip says not to repeat the same action if nothing changes. The last action was north, and the agent moved there. Now, possible moves are north again, but the dark area is very near north. Alternatively, check other directions. Let's see the observations again. The dark areas are very near north, northeast, east, southeast, southwest, west, and northwest. So the only open direction might be south, but there's a wall. Wait, the horizontal wall is very near south, so moving south into the wall would not work. So the agent can't go south directly. But the stairs up are there. However, the stairs down might be elsewhere.

Since the agent is on level 1, the stairs down are likely somewhere else in the maze. The agent needs to explore the surrounding dark areas. The best approach is to move towards unexplored areas. Since moving north got the agent here, maybe moving in another direction. Let's check the map. The map shows the agent's position as (24,12) with a '.' and the stairs up as '<' at (24,13) since the previous map had the stairs up adjacent south. Wait, the current map shows the agent at (24,12), and the stairs up are south. So moving south would take the agent to (24,13), which is the '<' spot. But that's stairs up, not down.

So the agent should explore other directions. The dark areas are in all directions except south (where the wall is). So possible moves are north again, but that's where they came from. Alternatively, check east, west, etc. Maybe the agent should move east or west to start exploring. But the horizontal wall is very near south, so moving south isn't possible. Let's think: the agent's current position is (24,12). The dark areas are very near north, northeast, east, southeast, southwest, west, and northwest. So the adjacent cells in those directions are dark, meaning unexplored. The agent could move in any of those directions, but perhaps choosing a direction that could lead towards the stairs down.

Alternatively, since the agent is a knight, maybe using a weapon to probe or check for doors. But the available actions don't include probing. The possible actions are movement in eight directions. The tip says not to repeat the same action unless necessary. The last action was north, and the agent moved there. Now, moving north again would take them back to (24,13), which was the previous position. But the message after moving north didn't change anything, so moving north again isn't helpful. The agent should try a different direction.

Looking at the map, the agent is in a dark area with a horizontal wall south. The stairs up are south. Since the stairs down are likely elsewhere, the agent needs to move in a direction that's not blocked by walls. The horizontal wall is very near south, so moving south isn't possible. Let's check other directions. For example, moving east to (25,12). If that's a dark area, moving there could help explore. Alternatively, moving west to (23,12).

Another approach: since the agent is at (24,12), and the stairs up are at (24,13), perhaps moving west to (23,12) could lead to a corridor or another path. The goal is to explore and find the stairs down. The agent should pick a direction that's unexplored and not a wall. The horizontal wall is south, but other directions may have passages. Let's choose east as a possible direction. So the next action could be east.

Let's analyze the current situation step by step. The agent is at position (25, 12). The map shows that to the west is a dark area, and there are walls to the northeast and southeast. The stairs up are adjacent to the southwest. The inventory includes various items, but the immediate goal is to reach the stairs down to proceed further.

First, the agent needs to navigate towards the stairs south. In the previous step, moving east led to this position. Now, looking at the map, the stairs up are southwest, but since the goal is to reach the stairs down, which isn't explicitly mentioned here, perhaps the stairs down are in another part of the level. However, the current observation doesn't mention stairs down, so the priority might be to explore and find the exit.

The agent is on a corridor with walls to the northeast and southeast. Moving south might lead towards the stairs up, but since the goal is to go down, maybe moving in another direction is better. The dark area to the west suggests there might be unexplored areas there. Alternatively, moving south could bring the agent closer to the stairs up, but perhaps the stairs down are elsewhere.

Wait, the message says ""stairs up adjacent southwest,"" but the agent's goal is to reach the stairs down. So maybe the agent should first explore other directions to find where the stairs down are located. The dark areas to the north, east, and northwest might be paths to explore. However, the immediate surroundings have walls on the northeast and southeast, so moving east or south might not be ideal.

Alternatively, since the stairs up are southwest, maybe moving southwest towards them would be a way to proceed, but again, the goal is stairs down. Perhaps the agent needs to explore more of the level. The dark area to the west could be a corridor leading to other parts of the dungeon. Moving west might continue exploration.

Another consideration: the agent has a weapon and armor, which is good for combat, but exploring is the priority. The vertical wall to the northeast and southeast suggests that moving in those directions is blocked. So possible moves are north, west, south, or southwest. But moving north leads to a dark area, west might open up a corridor, south is a wall, and southwest is stairs up. 

Since the goal is stairs down, which isn't currently visible, the agent should explore other areas. Moving west into the dark area might reveal more of the map. Alternatively, moving north into another dark area could also help. But looking at the map, moving north would be into a dark area north of (24,12), which was previously noted. However, the current position is (25,12), so moving north from here would be into (25,11), which is dark. 

Alternatively, moving southwest towards the stairs up might not help unless there's a way to descend from there, but NetHack typically has stairs down in other locations. Maybe the agent should first explore other directions. Let's check the map again. The map shows a vertical wall to the northeast and southeast, so moving east or southeast is blocked. Moving south is a horizontal wall. Therefore, the possible free directions are north, west, southwest.

Looking at the cursor position (25,12), moving west would take the agent to (24,12), which was the previous position. Moving north to (25,11) is dark. Moving southwest to (24,11) is the stairs up. But since the goal is stairs down, perhaps the agent should continue exploring other areas first.

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to move in a direction that isn't immediately blocked. Since moving west returns to the previous spot, which had a horizontal wall south, perhaps moving north into the dark area could lead to new areas. However, the tip says to avoid repeating actions if nothing changes. The agent just moved east, then south, then east again. Now, moving west would take back steps, which might not be efficient.

Another approach: since the stairs down are the target, and the current location has stairs up (southwest), maybe the agent needs to find another part of the level where the stairs down are located. Exploring the dark areas to the north or west could lead to that. Moving north into the dark area might reveal a path downward.

Given the options, moving north into the dark area could be a good choice to continue exploration. Alternatively, moving west into the dark area might also be viable. However, the map shows that to the west (24,12) is dark, but moving west from (25,12) would be to (24,12), which was previously explored (the agent was there before moving east). The message there mentioned a horizontal wall to the south, so perhaps that area is a dead end. Moving north into the dark area at (25,11) might lead to a new corridor.

So the best action here is to move north into the unexplored dark area to continue exploring and potentially find the stairs down.

Let's see where I am. I'm at (25, 11). The stairs up are very near southsouthwest, which I think is southwest. The map shows a horizontal wall adjacent to the north and northwest. Also, there's a vertical wall east.

First, I need to get to the stairs down. But right now, I'm trying to reach the stairs up because the goal is to reach the stairs down. Wait, maybe the message said ""stairs up very near southsouthwest"". So maybe that's a misdirection? Or perhaps the stairs down are in another part of the level. Wait, the user's goal is to reach the stairs down, but in the observations so far, the stairs up are adjacent southsouthwest (which would be southwest). But maybe I need to explore more to find the actual stairs down.

Looking at the map, the current position has a horizontal wall north and northwest. The vertical wall is east. So moving north is blocked by a wall. Moving east is blocked. Maybe I should try moving west to get to a corridor or open area. Let me check the observations again.

The language observation mentions a horizontal wall near south. So maybe there's a wall directly south. Stairs up are very near southsouthwest (sw), which is southwest. So from (25,11), moving southwest would take me to (24,12?), but I need to check the map.

Wait, the map's rows and columns can be a bit confusing. Let me visualize it. The agent is at (25,11). The map shows the agent's position as ..@| in the third row (since the map's rows are from top to bottom). The previous observation showed a horizontal wall very near south, so moving south from (25,11) would hit a wall. The stairs up are southwest, so maybe moving southwest would reach the stairs up, but since the goal is to get downstairs, perhaps stairs down are elsewhere.

But in the current state, the stairs up are adjacent southwest, but maybe the stairs down are in another part of the level. Since the agent is on Dlvl:1, stairs up take you to the surface, and stairs down take you deeper. So the goal is to find the stairs down. However, in the observations provided, there's mention of stairs up adjacent south, but in the last observation, stairs up are southwest. Maybe the agent needs to navigate through the dungeon to find the correct stairs.

Looking at the map, there's a vertical wall east, so moving east is blocked. The horizontal walls to the north and northwest might mean that those directions are blocked. Moving west might be possible. Let's check the previous steps. The agent moved north from (24,13) to (24,12), then east to (25,12), north to (25,11). Now, from (25,11), possible moves could be west, south, southwest, or northwest. But south is blocked by a wall. Southwest is the stairs up. Northwest would be back towards (24,10), but not sure.

Wait, in the current map, the agent's position is (25,11) and the stairs up are southwest. So moving southwest would be (24,12), but according to the previous observation, at (24,12), there was a stairs up symbol. However, the goal is to reach the stairs down. So perhaps the agent needs to explore more of the level to find the downstairs.

Given that the agent has a +1 long sword and is wearing ring mail, helmet, shield, etc., perhaps the prioritized actions should be moving towards unexplored areas. The dark areas are near west, southwest, and southeast. The agent should move towards a dark area to explore. The dark area near west could be a good direction. Let me check the language observation again.

The language observation says dark areas near west, southwest, and very near southeast. So moving west might be a good option to explore. However, moving west from (25,11) would go to (24,11). The map shows a horizontal wall adjacent north and northwest, but perhaps moving west could lead into a corridor.

Alternatively, moving southwest towards the stairs up, but since the goal is to go down, maybe that's not the right path. But perhaps first, the agent needs to find where the stairs down are. Since the current map doesn't show any stairs down, the agent needs to explore more.

The best action here might be to move west to explore the dark area. Let's confirm. From (25,11), west is (24,11). The map shows a horizontal wall near the north, but moving west could lead into a new area. The vertical wall is east, so that's blocked. Let me check the previous steps again.

In the last observation, the agent moved north to (25,11), and the map shows a horizontal wall adjacent to the north and northwest. So moving north is blocked. Moving west might lead to a corridor. Alternatively, moving southwest towards the stairs up, but that's for going up. Since the goal is to go down, perhaps the agent needs to find another part of the level where the stairs down are located.

Alternatively, the agent could move south, but the horizontal wall is very near south, so that's blocked. So the possible moves are west, southwest, or northwest. Southwest is stairs up, which is not helpful for going down. Northwest would be (24,10), but not sure if that's explored.

Wait, the agent's current position is (25,11). The map's third row (assuming rows are from top to bottom) shows .... with the agent's position at (25,11). The row above (y=12) has .<.|, which might indicate the stairs up at southwest. So from (25,11), moving southwest would be to (24,12), which is where the stairs up are. But the goal is stairs down. So perhaps the agent needs to explore further.

Given that the dark area is near west, moving west to (24,11) could reveal more of the map. Let's check the language observation again: dark area near west. So moving west might be a good idea to explore. Alternatively, moving northwest to check that area. But west seems more promising.

Another thought: the agent has a sword and armor, so maybe it's safe to proceed. Since the goal is to reach the stairs down, which isn't currently visible, the agent should explore unexplored areas. Moving west into the dark area would help. Let's go with west.

Let's see. The agent is at (24,11) and needs to get to the stairs down. So far, they've been moving around, exploring. The last move was west to (24,11). The map shows stairs up very near south, so maybe moving south would take them to the stairs up. But the goal is to reach the stairs down. Maybe the stairs down are elsewhere, or perhaps the stairs up here are a misleading observation. Or maybe the agent needs to go further down once they find the correct stairs.

Looking at the language observation: horizontal wall near south, vertical walls east and southeast. Stairs up very near south. Dark areas are southwest and west. The current position is on a grid where south might be towards the stairs up, but the agent needs stairs down. 

Hmm, maybe the stairs down are in another part of the level. Since the agent is on Dlvl:1, they might need to go down to Dlvl:2. But how to find them? The current surroundings have walls and dark areas. The previous steps moved north, east, etc., but perhaps the agent should explore more. 

The inventory has a long sword, lance, ring mail, helmet, shield, gloves, and food. Probably not necessary to pick up anything right now; the priority is exploration. 

Looking at the map, the agent is in a room with a horizontal wall to the north, vertical walls to the east. Stairs up are south. Maybe moving south to the stairs up, but then that's just going up, not down. Alternatively, moving west into the dark area? But the dark area might be a corridor or another room. 

Wait, the language observation says dark area very near southwest and west. So from (24,11), moving west would go into the west dark area, maybe a corridor leading somewhere. Alternatively, moving south to the stairs up, but that's not helpful. The agent needs to go down. 

Since the agent is on level 1, stairs down are likely somewhere else. Let's check the map again. The previous map snippets show that after moving north, east, etc., the agent is in a part with a horizontal wall north. Maybe there's a door or a corridor leading down. 

Alternatively, the agent could try moving in other directions. The current position has a horizontal wall to the north, vertical walls east and southeast. So possible moves are south, west, or maybe northwest? But the walls are adjacent. 

Wait, in the current observation, the horizontal wall is adjacent to north, northeast, and northwest. So moving northwest might hit a wall. Similarly, moving northeast or east is blocked by vertical walls. So possible moves are south or west. 

Stairs up are very near south. If the agent moves south, they'll reach the stairs up. But that's not helpful. The agent needs to find stairs down. So maybe moving west into the dark area would be better. Let's see: dark area very near southwest and west. From (24,11), moving west would take them to (23,11), which is a dark area. That might lead to a corridor or another room with stairs down. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a door somewhere. But the current map doesn't show any doors. The horizontal wall is to the north, so maybe the area south is open. But the stairs up are there. 

Another approach: since the agent is a knight, maybe they can break down walls. But that's a later step. For now, exploration is key. 

So the best bet is to move west into the dark area to explore further. That might lead to stairs down or other paths. Alternatively, moving southwest? But the language observation says dark area very near southwest. So moving southwest from (24,11) would be (23,12), which is a dark area. 

But the agent just came from the north (previous move was west to (24,11)), so maybe the north is a wall. Let's check the map again. The map shows a horizontal wall at y=11 north of the agent. So moving north would hit a wall. 

So possible safe moves are south (towards stairs up) or west (into dark area). Since the goal is stairs down, moving west might be better. Let's go with west.

Let's see where the stairs down are. From the previous observations, the stairs up were in different positions. Now, after moving west again to (23,11), the map shows stairs up very near southsoutheast. Actually, the current observation's language says stairs up very near southsoutheast. So the stairs are in the southsoutheast direction from my current position.

Looking at the map, the cursor is at (23,11). The vertical wall is on the east, and the horizontal walls are north and northeast. The dark area is near southeast. So to get to the stairs up in the southsoutheast, I need to move diagonally southeast. But the allowed actions are the eight directions. So moving southeast directly might be possible. Wait, the previous steps: the agent was moving north, east, north, west, west, and now is at (23,11). The stairs up are southsoutheast, which would be the direction from (23,11) to (24,12), but since movement is in eight directions, moving southeast would take me to (24,12). But in the current map, the horizontal wall is adjacent north and northeast, so maybe the corridor is blocked there. The vertical wall is east, so moving east isn't possible. 

Alternatively, the stairs up are very near southsoutheast. So moving southeast would get me closer. Let me check the map again. The map shows at (23,11), the southsoutheast direction would be towards (24,12). The previous map had a .<.| at (24,12) when the agent was there. Wait, in the earlier steps, when the agent was at (24,12), there was a stairs up adjacent south. Now, after moving west to (23,11), the stairs are southsoutheast. So moving southeast from (23,11) to (24,12) would reach that position. But I need to confirm if that's allowed. The language observation mentions vertical walls on east and southwest adjacent, but moving southeast from (23,11) would go to (24,12), which was previously a spot with a stairs up. So probably safe. 

Therefore, the next action should be southeast to move towards the stairs up. Let me check if there's any other clues. The inventory shows a lot of food, but since the goal is to reach the stairs down, maybe moving towards the stairs up first is better. Wait, no, the goal is to reach the stairs down. But in NetHack, sometimes stairs down are not immediately available on level 1. Wait, the initial message says ""welcome to NetHack"" and the agent is at Dlvl:1. Usually, level 1 has stairs down in a random location. But in this case, maybe the stairs down are on the same level, but the agent needs to explore. However, the problem statement says ""reach the stairs down"", so perhaps the stairs down are on level 1, or maybe the agent needs to go down to deeper levels. But given the initial observation, the agent is on level 1. 

Wait, but in the initial observation, the message was ""Salutations Agent, welcome to NetHack! You are a lawful female human Knight."" Then after moving north a few times, the stairs up appeared. Now, the agent needs to find the stairs down. But in NetHack, level 1 usually has both stairs up (to enter) and stairs down (to leave), but sometimes they are in different places. Alternatively, maybe the agent is in a dungeon branch, and needs to find the correct stairs. 

But according to the problem statement, the goal is to reach the stairs down. So perhaps the agent needs to explore the current level and find where the stairs down are located. However, in the current observations, the stairs up are present, but not the stairs down. So the agent might need to move around to find the stairs down. 

Looking at the current position (23,11), the stairs up are southsoutheast. Maybe the stairs down are in the opposite direction, but that's not necessarily the case. Alternatively, the agent could try to move in a different direction to explore more of the level. 

Looking at the map, the agent is in a corridor with walls on north, northeast, east, and southwest. The dark areas are near southeast and west. The horizontal wall is south. So moving south from (23,11) would hit the horizontal wall. Moving west again would take to (22,11), but the vertical wall is adjacent to the southwest, so perhaps that's a wall. 

Wait, the language observation says vertical wall adjacent southwest and west. So from (23,11), moving west would go to (22,11), but there's a vertical wall there. So west is blocked. Moving northwest would be to (22,10), but is that a wall? The language observation doesn't mention walls in that direction, only horizontal walls near south and north. 

Given that, the agent's best bet is to move towards the stairs up in the southsoutheast direction, perhaps to find where they lead, and see if there's a way down from there. Alternatively, since the goal is stairs down, maybe the agent should try to explore other areas. 

But in the current state, the agent is at (23,11), and the stairs up are southsoutheast. Moving southeast would take to (24,12), which was previously a spot with stairs up. Maybe moving there and then looking around. Since the previous steps had the agent moving in a pattern, perhaps continuing to explore the corridors. 

Alternatively, the agent could move south to the horizontal wall, but that's a dead end. So the best action is to move southeast towards the stairs up, hoping that from there, there are stairs down. Or perhaps the agent needs to go west again, but that's blocked by a vertical wall. 

So the chosen action is southeast.

6,south,"<reasoning>
The agent's goal is to reach the stairs down. Observing the current state, the agent is at position (24,12). The stairs up are adjacent to the south, so moving south would take them to the stairs. The message history shows that previously, moving south from (24,13) led to stairs up, but now the stairs are adjacent south here.

Wait, in the last few steps, the agent moved west multiple times and then southeast. The map shows that stairs up are adjacent south. So the next logical step is to move south towards the stairs. The tip says not to repeat actions if nothing changes, but since the stairs are now adjacent, moving south should be the best move here. The agent should go south to reach the stairs up, which is the objective. No need to explore further directions since the stairs are directly accessible now.

The agent needs to reach the stairs down. Let me check the current observation.

The map shows the agent is at (24,13). The stairs up were previously at (24,12) south, but now looking at the latest map, the stairs are adjacent south. Wait, the current map after moving south shows that the agent is back at (24,13). The previous move to south left them at y=13, so the stairs up must be south again here. But in the latest observation, the stairs up are adjacent south. However, looking at the current map, the agent is at (24,13) and the stairs up are adjacent south, so moving south again would take them to the stairs. 

But the user's message says the goal is to reach the stairs down, not up. Wait, the initial problem statement says ""reach the stairs down"". In NetHack, stairs down are typically the way to go deeper into the dungeon. However, in the current observation, the stairs up are adjacent south. The agent might have moved in circles here. 

Wait, maybe there's confusion between stairs up and down. Let me check the previous steps. The initial position had stairs up south. The agent moved north, then east, north, west, west, southeast, south, and now is back at (24,13) with stairs up south again. But the goal is to reach the stairs down, so perhaps the stairs down are somewhere else. 

Looking at the map, there's a horizontal wall near north, vertical walls in some directions. The dark areas indicate unexplored areas. The agent needs to navigate through these to find the stairs down. Since the immediate stairs up are here, but the goal is down, maybe the agent should explore other directions first. 

The language observation mentions horizontal walls very near south, vertical walls near east and northwest, and dark areas near west and southeast. So moving west might lead to a dark area, perhaps a corridor. Alternatively, moving northeast or southeast could explore more. But the agent should avoid going in circles. 

Previously, moving west multiple times brought the agent back. Maybe moving east again could open up a path. Alternatively, since the stairs down are the target, perhaps the agent needs to find a different route. 

Looking at the current position (24,13), stairs up are south. To find stairs down, maybe the agent needs to explore northeast or southeast. Let's check the map again. The map shows a horizontal wall adjacent southeast, south, and southwest at the current position. So moving east might hit a vertical wall. Moving south would take to stairs up, which isn't the goal. 

Wait, maybe the agent should try to go west again, into the dark area. The language observation says dark area near west. Moving west from (24,13) would take to (23,13), which is dark. That might reveal more of the map and perhaps lead to stairs down. 

Alternatively, moving northeast from (24,13) could lead to a new area. But the vertical walls are near northeast and east. Hmm. Let's think. The agent's inventory has a sword, armor, etc., but no amulet of Yendor, which is the goal in NetHack, but the user here specific goal is stairs down. 

So the plan is to explore uncharted areas. The agent is currently at (24,13) with stairs up south. To avoid going in circles, moving west into the dark area seems logical. That could lead to a new part of the dungeon where stairs down might be. 

Alternatively, check if there's a way north. The horizontal wall is near north, so moving north might hit a wall. Let me check the language observation: horizontal wall very near north. So moving north from (24,13) would hit a wall. 

Therefore, possible moves are west into dark area, or east (but vertical wall nearby). South leads to stairs up, which is not the goal. So the best action is to move west towards the dark area to explore further and possibly find the stairs down.

Let's try to figure out what the best move is here. The agent is a knight on level 1 of NetHack. The goal is to reach the stairs down, which I assume is stairs leading to the next dungeon level. Looking at the current observation after the last action (west), the agent is at position (23,13).

From the map, the stairs up are adjacent to the east. But the task is to reach the stairs down. Wait, maybe in this case, the stairs down are somewhere else. The messages and observations haven't mentioned stairs down yet. The agent needs to explore the level to find them.

The current situation shows that moving east would take the agent back towards the stairs up, but that's probably not helpful. Instead, the agent should explore other directions. Looking at the language observation, there's a vertical wall near the east, and horizontal walls near north. The dark areas are in various directions, so maybe those are unexplored spaces.

The agent's position is (23,13). The stairs up are adjacent east, but the goal is stairs down. So maybe moving west further or south could lead to a different area. Let me check the map again. The map shows some structure with walls and rooms. The agent is in a part that has walls to the east and northeast, so maybe moving west or south could lead to a corridor or another room.

Since the agent has already moved west a few times, perhaps moving south would explore the area below. Alternatively, moving northwest or southwest might be options, but the vertical wall to the west might block movement there. The language observation mentions a vertical wall adjacent to west and northwest, so moving west again isn't possible. The agent is already at x=23, so moving west further would hit the wall.

Looking at the horizontal walls, the south direction has a horizontal wall adjacent. So moving south might lead into a wall. Wait, in the current observation, the horizontal wall is very near south. So moving south directly might hit the wall. But maybe there's a door or a passage nearby. Alternatively, moving northeast or southeast could navigate around the walls.

Alternatively, since the stairs down are probably in a different part of the level, the agent should keep exploring. The last message didn't mention any stairs down, so the agent hasn't found them yet. The best approach is to move in a direction that's not blocked by walls and hasn't been explored much yet.

Looking at the dark areas, the agent has a dark area near west, which they just came from. The dark area near north, northeast, southeast, southwest, east, and northwest were mentioned earlier, but after moving around, some of those might have been lit up. However, the current dark areas are west and southeast. So maybe moving northeast or southeast could help.

Wait, in the previous steps, the agent moved north, east, north again, west, and so on. The current position is (23,13). The stairs up are east, but the agent needs stairs down. Since the agent is a knight, maybe they can open doors, but the current inventory doesn't have any tools like a crowbar. The agent has a sword and shield, but those are for combat. So perhaps exploration is key here.

The agent should check adjacent squares. The language observation says that the horizontal wall is very near south. So moving south would hit the wall. The vertical wall is near east, so moving east would hit the wall. The vertical wall is also adjacent to west and northwest, so moving west again is blocked. So the possible movements are north, northeast, southeast, or southwest.

Looking at the map, the agent is in a part that has a room with walls to the east and south. Moving northeast might take them into a corridor or another room. Let's see: the map shows ""|@<.|..."" which might indicate a corridor. The agent's current position is in a cell that's part of a corridor. Maybe moving northeast would explore further.

Alternatively, moving southwest could lead to an unexplored area. Let's check the dark areas. The language observation mentions dark areas near west and southeast. So moving southwest might head towards the dark area in the southeast. Wait, the dark area very near southeast is mentioned. So moving southeast could be a way to explore that area.

But wait, the agent is at (23,13). Moving southeast would take them to (24,14). If that's a dark area, moving there might reveal more of the map. Alternatively, moving northeast to (24,12) could be a better path. Let me think about the map structure again.

The map shows:

                      -----                                                     
                      |...|                                                     
                      |....                                                     
                      |@<.|                                                     
                      ----                                                      

So, the agent is in the third row (y=11?), but the current position is (23,13). Maybe the map's rows and columns are different. The cursor's position is (24,13) in the previous step, but now it's (23,13). The map's layout is a bit confusing, but the key is to avoid walls and explore dark areas.

The agent's options are north, northeast, southeast, or southwest. Moving north would go to (23,12). The language observation says there's a horizontal wall very near south, but north might be clear. Let's check the language observation again. It says horizontal wall near north, so moving north might hit a wall. Wait, the language observation says ""horizontal wall near north,"" which means adjacent to the agent's current position north? If so, moving north would be blocked.

So the possible safe moves are northeast, southeast, or southwest. Let's look at the dark areas. The dark area very near southeast is at (24,14), perhaps. Moving southeast could lead there. Alternatively, moving southwest to (22,13) which might be another dark area. But the vertical wall is adjacent to west and northwest, so moving west is blocked. So southwest might be a valid direction.

Alternatively, moving northeast to (24,12) which was previously explored but might have a clear path. The agent needs to avoid getting stuck in loops. Since the previous actions included moving north, east, north, west, etc., it's important to explore new directions.

Given the current position and the walls, the best bet might be to move south, but that's blocked by a horizontal wall. So the next option is to move northeast or southeast. Let's choose southeast to head towards the dark area and see if there's a path.

Let's see. The agent is at position (23,13) and tried moving southeast but hit a wall. So the path there is blocked. The stairs up are adjacent to the east, so maybe moving east towards the stairs. But first, check the surroundings again.

Looking at the language observation: horizontal walls near north, vertical walls near east, and the stairs are to the east. The current position is (23,13). The stairs up are east, so the next move should be east. But the agent was at (23,13) and tried southeast which was a wall. So moving east from (23,13) would take them to (24,13), which is the stairs. Wait, looking at the previous map, when the agent was at (24,12) and moved north, they saw stairs up in the south. Now, after moving west to (23,13), the stairs up are adjacent east. So moving east from (23,13) should reach the stairs. That makes sense. So the correct action here is to move east to reach the stairs up.

Let's see. The goal is to reach the stairs down. The stairs up are adjacent to the southwest corner according to the last observation. But the current position is (24, 13), and the stairs up are in the southwest. I need to figure out how to get there.

Looking at the map, the agent is at the center of the current level. The last observation shows a horizontal wall adjacent to south, southeast, and southwest. The vertical walls are to the northeast, east, west, and northwest. So the southwest direction seems promising. The stairs up are southwest. 

Previously, the agent tried moving southeast and ended up hitting a wall. Now, the best approach might be to move south first. From (24,13), moving south would take the agent to (24,14). Then, moving southwest towards the stairs. 

Alternatively, maybe moving west first towards the stairs. But if the stairs are southwest, moving south then southwest might be the way. Need to check the previous steps. 

Wait, in the last step, the agent moved east to (24,13) and saw stairs up adjacent to southwest. So from (24,13), moving southwest would be (23,12). But how to get there without hitting walls?

Looking at the current map, there's a horizontal wall very near south, so moving south from (24,13) might lead into a wall. Hmm, that's a problem. So maybe need to adjust direction. If moving south is blocked, perhaps go west first, then south, then southwest. 

So from (24,13), moving west to (23,13), then south to (23,14), then southwest to (22,13)? Wait, but need to confirm if those paths are open. The language observation mentions horizontal walls in certain directions. 

Alternatively, the agent could try moving west again to (23,13), then south to (23,14), then southwest to (22,13). But need to make sure those are not walls. The last message mentioned ""horizontal wall very near south"" when the agent was at (24,13). So moving south from there is blocked. Hence, can't go directly south. 

So the alternative path is west, then south, then southwest. Let's check. At (23,13), the horizontal walls would be the same? Or maybe different. The current language observation shows vertical walls very near northeast, east, west, northwest. So west is a vertical wall. So moving west from (24,13) to (23,13) is possible? The vertical wall is very near west, so maybe at (23,13), the west direction is a vertical wall. Wait, the cursor is at (23,13), and the vertical wall is adjacent west. So moving west from there would hit a wall. 

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe the agent needs to navigate around the walls. Let's think again. The stairs up are southwest. From (24,13), southwest is (23,12). To get there, need to move south first. But moving south is blocked by a horizontal wall. So perhaps move west to (23,13), then north, then southwest? But that might not reach the stairs. 

Alternatively, find another path. Let's check the map again. The map shows a horizontal wall near north, and the current position's south has a horizontal wall. So perhaps the stairs are in a different location. Wait, the last message before the current step said ""stairs up adjacent south"". But when the agent was at (24,12), the stairs were south. Wait, maybe there's confusion here. 

Looking back at the history: when the agent was at (24,12), the stairs up were adjacent south. Then moving north to (24,11), then west to (23,11), etc. Now, the stairs up are adjacent southsoutheast. So perhaps the stairs are in the southwest direction from the current position. 

Wait, in the latest observation, the agent is at (24,13) and the stairs up are adjacent southsoutheast. So the stairs are to the southeast of south, which would be south-southeast. So the direction would be southeast from (24,13). But earlier, moving southeast resulted in hitting a wall. That's conflicting. 

Wait, the language observation now says: ""horizontal wall very near north"" and ""horizontal wall adjacent southeast, south, and southwest"". So from (24,13), moving south would hit a horizontal wall. Moving southeast would go to (25,14), but according to the language observation, that's a horizontal wall. So that's why moving southeast causes a wall hit. 

Therefore, the stairs up must be elsewhere. The message says stairs up are adjacent southsoutheast. So southsoutheast from (24,13) would be (25,14). But that's a wall. So maybe the message is conflicting with the map. Alternatively, perhaps the agent needs to re-examine the surroundings. 

Alternatively, maybe the stairs are in the southwest direction. Let's see. The stairs up are adjacent southwest. So from (24,13), southwest is (23,12). To get there, need to move west twice and south once. But moving west from (24,13) to (23,13) is blocked by a vertical wall (as per language observation: vertical wall very near west). So moving west is not possible. 

Therefore, the agent needs to find another path. Maybe go north, then west, then south, then southwest. Let's try that. From (24,13), move north to (24,12). Then west to (23,12). Then south to (23,13). Then southwest to (22,12). But need to check if these movements are possible. 

At (24,12), moving west to (23,12): what's there? The language observation at (24,12) had horizontal walls near south and vertical walls near east. Not sure about west. Alternatively, maybe moving northwest from (24,12) to (23,11). Then see. 

This is getting a bit tricky. Maybe the best approach is to continue moving southwest around the walls. Since moving directly south and southeast are blocked, perhaps move west, then south, then southwest. But moving west from (24,13) is blocked. Hmm. 

Alternatively, move north again to (24,12), then west to (23,12) (if possible), then south to (23,13), then southwest to (22,13). Let's check the map. From (24,12), moving west would be (23,12). The language observation at (24,12) says horizontal wall very near south. Not sure about west. If that's clear, then proceed. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent should try moving northwest. From (24,13) to (23,12). If that's a valid move. 

Wait, the agent's current position is (24,13). If they move northwest, it would take them to (23,12). Let's check if that's possible. According to the latest language observation: vertical walls very near northeast, east, west, and northwest. So moving northwest from (24,13) would go into the northwest vertical wall, which is very near. So that's a wall. 

Hmm. This is challenging. Maybe the agent needs to go around the east side. But the vertical wall is to the east. Alternatively, move south-southwest? But that's hitting a horizontal wall. 

Alternatively, pick up the items and see if that helps. The inventory has a sword, lance, ring mail, helmet, shield, gloves, food. Maybe using the sword to break walls. But I don't think the agent can attack walls yet. 

Wait, the agent is a knight, so maybe they can break down doors or walls. But the problem states to avoid repeating the same action. If the agent tries to move into a wall multiple times, it's not efficient. 

Alternatively, perhaps the stairs are in the south direction but requires moving around. The agent tried moving south but hit a wall. Maybe moving west then south. But west is blocked. 

Wait, the agent's current position is (24,13). The vertical wall is very near west, so moving west is blocked. So the agent can't go west. Need to find another way. 

Maybe move north to (24,12), then east to (25,12). From there, move south to (25,13), then southwest to (24,12). But not sure. 

Alternatively, the agent could move northeast. From (24,13) to (25,12). Let's see if that's possible. The language observation says horizontal walls adjacent southeast, south, and southwest. From (24,13), moving northeast would be to (25,12). The vertical walls are very near east, northeast. So moving northeast might be blocked. 

This is really tricky. Maybe the agent should try moving south-southwest around the horizontal wall. From (24,13), moving southwest twice. But the first move southwest would be (23,12), which if possible, then again to (22,11). 

But how to confirm if that's possible. The agent needs to navigate around the walls carefully. 

Another approach: since the stairs up are adjacent to the southwest, which is likely (23,12) from (24,13), the agent needs to reach that coordinate. To get there, move west and south. But moving west is blocked. So perhaps move north, then west, then south, then southwest. 

From (24,13) move north to (24,12). Then west to (23,12). But is west from (24,12) allowed? The language observation at (24,12) mentions vertical walls very near east, northeast, southeast, southwest, west, and northwest. So moving west from (24,12) would hit a vertical wall. That's not possible. 

Hmm. This suggests that the path to the stairs is blocked, and the agent needs to find another route. Maybe there's a doorway or a passage that hasn't been explored yet. 

Alternatively, the agent should continue moving in a different direction. Let's look at the previous movements. The agent started at (24,13), moved north to (24,12), east to (25,12), north to (25,11), west to (24,11), west to (23,11), southeast to (24,12), south to (24,13), west to (23,13), southeast (hit wall), east back to (24,13). 

Perhaps the agent should try moving east again, then south, then southwest. From (24,13), east to (25,13), then south to (25,14), then southwest to (24,13). But that brings them back. 

Alternatively, move east, then north, then west. But that might not help. 

Wait, the stairs up are adjacent southsoutheast. So from (24,13), southsoutheast is (25,14). But that's a horizontal wall. So maybe the stairs are actually in a different location. 

Maybe the agent needs to re-examine the map. The map shows the agent's position as |.@.| on the third line from the bottom. The stairs up are adjacent southsoutheast, which would be to the southeast of the current position's south. So moving from (24,13) south to (24,14), then southeast to (25,14). But (24,14) is a horizontal wall. So that's blocked. 

This is really confusing. Maybe the agent should try to move around the horizontal wall to the south. If moving south is blocked, go west or east around it. 

From (24,13), moving west to (23,13) is blocked by a vertical wall. Moving east to (25,13), then south to (25,14) (which is a wall). So that's not working. 

Alternative idea: move north to (24,12), then east to (25,12), then south to (25,13), then southwest to (24,12). But again, hitting walls. 

Perhaps the agent should pick up items to see if that helps. For example, the apples or carrots. But the goal is to reach the stairs down, not collect items. 

Alternatively, the agent could try to move in a different pattern, like spiral exploration. Move north, east, south, west, repeating until finding the stairs. 

But given the current position and the walls, the best bet might be to move west, then north, then east, then south, then southwest. Let's try that. 

From (24,13) move west to (23,13) (but vertical wall there). So can't. 

Alternatively, move north to (24,12), then west to (23,12) (if possible), then south to (23,13), then southwest to (22,12). 

But how to confirm if (23,12) is passable. From (24,12), moving west would be (23,12). The language observation at (24,12) says vertical walls very near west. So that's a wall. 

This is really frustrating. Maybe the agent needs to accept that the stairs are in the southwest and find a way around the walls. Since moving directly southwest is blocked, perhaps go north, then west, then south, then southwest. 

But again, moving west from (24,13) is blocked. 

Wait, maybe the agent can move northwest from (24,13) to (23,12). But the language observation says vertical walls very near northwest. So that's a wall. 

Hmm. At this point, the agent might be stuck. Maybe the only way is to proceed in a different direction. Let's try moving east twice. From (24,13) to (25,13), then east to (26,13). But according to the map, there's a horizontal wall adjacent northeast, south, and southwest. Not sure. 

Alternatively, move south-southeast (diagonal) but the allowed actions are only the 8 directions. So the agent can only move in the eight cardinal directions. 

Given all this, perhaps the best action is to move south again, even though it's blocked, to see if there's a different observation. But the previous attempt resulted in a wall. 

Alternatively, move west, but it's blocked. 

Wait, maybe the agent is looking in the wrong place. The stairs up are adjacent southsoutheast, which is a specific direction. Maybe the agent needs to move in a diagonal direction. But the allowed actions are only the eight main directions, not diagonals. 

So southsoutheast would be moving southeast twice or once diagonally. But the agent can't do diagonal moves. So the closest is moving southeast then south, or south then southeast. 

But both directions are blocked. 

Hmm. Maybe the agent needs to pick a different strategy. Since exploration is key, perhaps continue moving in a pattern, like moving east, north, west, south, etc., to map out the area. 

But the goal is to reach the stairs down. Maybe the stairs are in a different part of the level. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent should try to move around the horizontal wall to the south. From (24,13), move west to (23,13) (blocked), then north to (23,12), then east to (24,12), then south to (24,13). That loops back. 

This is getting me nowhere. Maybe I should look for a different approach. Let's check the latest observation again. 

Current position: (24,13). Stairs up adjacent southsoutheast. So the stairs are one step southsoutheast from here. Which would be (25,14). But that's a horizontal wall. So maybe the stairs are actually in a different position. 

Wait, perhaps the stairs are in the southwest direction from (24,13), which is (23,12). But moving there is blocked by a vertical wall. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to use the sword to break down the wall. But the agent doesn't have the ability to attack walls with the sword yet. Knights can attack in melee, but only if there's a creature present. 

Since there are no creatures mentioned in the messages, the agent can't attack. 

At this point, maybe the best action is to move in a direction that wasn't previously blocked, like north again. From (24,13) to (24,12). Then see what's there. 

But the agent was at (24,12) before, and the stairs up were there. But moving north from (24,13) to (24,12) again would just revisit that spot. 

Alternatively, move east to (25,13), then south to (25,14) (blocked), then west to (24,14) (blocked). 

This seems to be a dead end. Maybe the agent should try moving southwest from (24,13) even though it's a wall. But that would result in the ""It's a wall"" message again. 

Alternatively, the agent should pick up an item to proceed. For example, the apples or carrots could be used to heal, but that doesn't help with moving. 

Wait, the agent has a +1 long sword. Maybe using it to attack a wall if possible. But without a creature nearby, the agent can't use it effectively. 

Given all this, perhaps the best course of action is to move southwest from (24,13) in the hope that the latest observation's message about stairs up being southsoutheast might have changed. But that's a gamble. 

Alternatively, the agent can move south to (24,14), even though it's a wall, to see if there's a different outcome. 

But the previous attempts to move south resulted in walls. 

Hmm. Given the information, the most logical step is to move southwest from (24,13) towards the supposed stairs location, even if it's a wall. But that might not work. 

Alternatively, the agent should move west again, but it's blocked. 

Wait, maybe the agent can move northwest from (24,13) to (23,12). But the language observation says vertical walls very near northwest. So that's a wall. 

Alright, I'm stuck. Maybe the best action is to move southwest, as per the latest observation indicating stairs are there, and see what happens. Even if it's a wall, maybe the observation is incorrect or there's a different path. 

So the chosen action is southwest.

",-0.01,False
11,north,"<reasoning>
Let's see. The agent is at (24,13) and needs to reach the stairs down. The previous actions led to hitting a wall when trying southeast. Now, the language observation mentions a horizontal wall near north and adjacent to southeast, south, and southwest. The cursor is back at (24,13).

Looking at the map, it seems like there's a corridor here. The agent has already moved around, checking north, east, south, west. After hitting a wall at southeast, moving southwest again might not work. The stairs up were previously seen adjacent to south, but now the current position is back to south having stairs. Wait, in the initial observation, stairs up were adjacent south, but after moving around, maybe the stairs are in another direction now?

Wait, looking back at the history, when the agent was at (24,12), there was a stairs up adjacent south. Then moving north to (24,11), then west, etc. Now, at (24,13), the message says ""It's a wall"" when trying southeast. So, the agent is in a grid where moving south might lead to stairs, but need to check again.

The latest observation shows horizontal walls near north and south. Maybe there's a room with walls around. The agent needs to navigate around the walls to find the open path to stairs. Since previous movements like north, south, east, west have been tried, perhaps trying different directions like northwest or northeast? But the walls are in those directions too. 

Wait, the current language observation says horizontal walls adjacent southeast, south, and southwest. So moving south would hit a horizontal wall. The stairs up were previously at south, but now maybe they're in another spot. Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to backtrack. When the agent was at (24,12), there was a stairs up adjacent south. But after moving north and west, maybe the stairs are no longer there? Or perhaps the agent needs to retrace steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the agent should try moving south-west again, but the wall is there. Maybe the stairs are in another part of the level. Since the goal is to reach the stairs down, which is typically in a different location than the stairs up. Wait, the initial message says ""stairs up adjacent south"", so the stairs down would be elsewhere. Maybe the agent needs to explore more, like moving east or west to find another path.

Looking at the map, when the agent was at (25,12), there was a vertical wall to the east. So moving east might hit a wall. But moving west from (24,13) to (23,13) had a vertical wall near east. Maybe the agent should try moving northwest or northeast? Let me check the latest cursor position: (24,13). The horizontal walls are adjacent to southeast, south, and southwest. So moving south would hit a wall. Moving southwest would also hit a wall. So possible directions: north, northwest, northeast, east, west.

Wait, the vertical walls are very near northeast, east, west, and northwest. So moving east or northeast would hit a wall. Therefore, possible safe moves are north, west, or southwest. But southwest hits a wall. North: from (24,13) moving north to (24,12), which was previously visited and had a stairs up. But that stairs is up, not down. The agent needs to find the stairs down, which is probably in a different location. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent should move west to (23,13) and then see if there's a path. But earlier when moving west from (24,13) to (23,13), the language observation showed vertical walls near east. So perhaps that's a dead end. 

Another approach: since the agent is a knight, maybe using charge with the lance to break walls. But the agent hasn't used any weapons yet. However, the problem says to avoid repeating actions if nothing changes. So maybe the agent should try to find a different path. 

Wait, the inventory shows a +1 long sword and a +1 lance. Maybe using the lance to attack walls. But the user hasn't specified that the agent can shoot. The allowed actions are movement only. So can't shoot, only move.

Therefore, the agent needs to navigate around the walls. From current position (24,13), possible moves: north to (24,12), which had stairs up, but that's not helpful. West to (23,13), which had vertical walls. So maybe the only option is to move northwest? Wait, moving northwest from (24,13) would be to (23,12). Let's check the map. Earlier when at (23,12), there was a horizontal wall very near south. Hmm, but maybe that's a different part. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent should try moving northeast to (25,12), but that had a vertical wall. So stuck. 

Wait, perhaps the agent should backtrack. From (24,13), moving north to (24,12), then west to (23,12), then north again to (23,11), which had a horizontal wall. This seems like going in circles. 

Alternatively, maybe the stairs down are in a different part of the level. Since the agent is on level 1, stairs down would be somewhere else. But how to find it? Maybe the agent needs to explore more east or west. But earlier movements east hit walls. 

Wait, when the agent was at (25,12), there was a vertical wall to the east. So moving east from there is blocked. But maybe the agent can move northeast from (24,12) to (25,11)? Not sure. 

Alternatively, the agent could try moving southwest again, but that's a wall. Maybe the agent should try moving in a different direction, like south-west, but that's still a wall. 

Hmm, perhaps the agent is in a corridor with walls on south, southeast, southwest, and the walls to the east and west. The only open directions might be north and northwest. But moving north takes back to (24,12) with stairs up. 

Since the agent's goal is to reach the stairs down, which isn't at the current location of stairs up, maybe the agent needs to proceed further north. From (24,12), moving north to (24,11), which had a horizontal wall. Then west to (23,11) which had vertical walls. This isn't working. 

Alternatively, perhaps the agent should move west to (23,13) and then try moving south. From (23,13), moving south to (23,14) if possible. But need to check if that's a wall. However, the current observation's map doesn't show that area. 

Wait, the map in the latest observation only shows up to y=13. The rest are empty. So maybe the agent can move south from (24,13) to (24,14), but the language observation says horizontal wall very near south. So moving south would hit a wall. 

This is getting confusing. The agent needs to find a path that isn't blocked by walls. Since movement to south, southeast, southwest are blocked, the options are north, northwest, west, or east. But east and northeast are blocked by walls. So perhaps the best move is to go north to (24,12), then west to (23,12), then north again to (23,11), but that area has a horizontal wall. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent should try moving northwest to (23,12). Let's see. From (24,13), moving northwest would be to (23,12). What's the observation there? Previously, at (23,12), the language observation mentioned horizontal wall very near south. So moving to (23,12) and then south would hit a wall. But maybe from (23,12), moving west or north? 

Alternatively, the agent could try moving west to (23,13), then north to (23,12), then west to (22,12), etc. But without knowing the layout beyond the current vision, it's risky. 

Another idea: since the agent has a lance, maybe using it to break walls. But the allowed actions are movement only. So cannot attack. 

Given all this, the only safe movement from (24,13) is north to (24,12), which had stairs up, but the agent needs to go down. So perhaps the agent should backtrack to (24,12), then explore other directions from there. 

So the next action would be north to (24,12) again. But the user's tip says to avoid repeating the same action if nothing changes. But in this case, maybe moving north again is necessary to re-examine the area. 

Alternatively, maybe moving west from (24,13) to (23,13) and then trying a different direction. But earlier attempts there hit walls. 

Hmm. Given the constraints, the best possible action is to move north back to (24,12) to check if there's another path from there that leads to the stairs down. Alternatively, move west to (23,13) and then see. 

But the latest observation shows that moving southeast from (24,13) is a wall, and moving southwest is also a wall. So the only options are north, northwest, west, or east. East and northeast are walls. So north or northwest. 

Given that, perhaps moving north to (24,12) is the best bet, as that's where the stairs up were previously located, and maybe from there, there's a different exit.

I need to get to the stairs down. Let's check the current situation.

Looking at the map, the agent is at (24,12). There's a stairs up to the south. Wait, the stairs up adjacent south? So moving south should take them up, but the goal is to reach the stairs down. Hmm, maybe the stairs up is just the starting point, and the actual stairs down is elsewhere in the dungeon.

The language observation says stairs up are adjacent south. So moving south would take them back up, which isn't helpful. They need to explore further. Let me check the map again.

From the current position, the map shows some walls. The horizontal wall very near north and south. So north is a wall? Or near north? The agent was previously at (24,12) after moving north from (24,13). The map shows a horizontal wall adjacent south at (24,12). Wait, the cursor is now at (24,12), and the horizontal wall is adjacent south. So moving south would hit a wall? Or is the wall nearby?

The messages say ""It's a wall"" when trying to move southeast or southwest earlier. So need to avoid those directions.

The agent needs to explore other directions. Let's look at the possible moves. The dark areas are near east, southeast, etc. Maybe moving east could lead somewhere. But previous attempts to move east led to vertical walls. Wait, in the last observation, moving east from (23,13) resulted in being at (24,13) with vertical walls nearby. But now, at (24,12), moving east might be possible.

Wait, the language observation now says horizontal wall very near north and south. So at (24,12), north is a horizontal wall nearby. So moving north would hit a wall. South is the stairs up, which is a wall? Or is the stairs up a separate feature. The stairs up are adjacent south, so maybe moving south leads to the stairs, but that's the starting point. The goal is stairs down, so need to find another way.

Possible safe moves: check the map for open areas. The dark areas are near east, southeast, etc. Maybe moving west? Let's see. From (24,12), moving west would take to (23,12). The vertical wall is very near east, so west might be open. Alternatively, check the horizontal walls. The horizontal wall is adjacent south, so moving south would be against the wall, but stairs up are there. So perhaps moving south is not useful unless that's the only option, but the goal is stairs down.

Wait, the initial message when the agent started was welcome to NetHack, and the stairs down are the objective. So the agent needs to find the downwards stairs, which are typically in other parts of the level. The current stairs up are the entrance. So the agent must explore other paths.

Looking at the map again, the agent is in a room with horizontal walls north and south, vertical walls east and west. The dark areas are in various directions. Maybe moving northeast or northwest could lead to corridors.

But the language observation mentions dark areas near east, southeast, etc., but also horizontal walls. So perhaps moving northwest? Let's see. From (24,12), northwest would be (23,11). Is there a wall there? The vertical wall is very near west, so moving west from (24,12) would hit the wall. Northwest might be possible if there's a corridor.

Wait, the previous steps: the agent moved north, east, north, west, west, southeast, south, west, southeast, east, southwest, north. Now at (24,12). The map shows some structure. Maybe there's a corridor to the northwest.

Alternatively, the agent could try moving west to (23,12). If there's no wall there, that's a possible path. Let me check the language observation. It says vertical wall very near east, but west direction? The vertical wall is adjacent west and northwest. So at (24,12), moving west would go to (23,12), which is not a wall. So west might be possible.

Alternatively, moving north is a wall, so can't go there. South is stairs up (wall). East is vertical wall. So the only possible direction is west. Let's try moving west to explore further.

Let's see. The goal is to reach the stairs down. From the current observation, the agent is at position (23,12). The stairs up are adjacent to the southeast, which would be moving east one step. But I need to check if there's a way to get there without hitting walls.

Looking at the map, the horizontal walls are very near north, northeast, southeast, and south. The vertical walls are adjacent to southwest, west, and northwest. So moving west from here would hit a vertical wall. Similarly, moving north or northeast would hit a horizontal wall. East is possible, but need to check if the path to the stairs up is clear. The stairs up are adjacent to southeast, which is the cell to the east and south. Wait, the current position is (23,12). East would take to (24,12), and then south to (24,13), which is where the stairs up are? Or is the stairs up directly to the southeast from the current position? The language observation says ""stairs up adjacent southeast"", so moving southeast from (23,12) would be (24,13). But the map shows that at (24,13), there's a .@. which might be the agent's previous position. Wait, in the current map, the agent's position is (23,12), and the stairs up are adjacent southeast. So moving southeast from (23,12) would take them to (24,13), which is the stairs up. But the map shows that cell as .<.| in the previous steps, but maybe that's changed. Wait, the current map shows:

In the map section, the lines are:

                      -----                                                     
                      |...|                                                     
                      |@...                                                     
                      |.<.|                                                     
                      ----                                                      

So the agent is at the position of @ in the third line (y=12), which is (23,12). The stairs up are adjacent southeast, so moving southeast from here would be to (24,13). But looking at the horizontal walls, the vertical wall is adjacent to southwest, west, and northwest. So moving east from (23,12) to (24,12) is possible, but then moving south to (24,13) might be blocked by a horizontal wall. Wait, the horizontal wall is very near north, northeast, southeast, and south. So at (24,13), which is south of (24,12), there's a horizontal wall. That would block moving into (24,13). So perhaps the stairs up are actually at (24,12) southeast direction? Wait, maybe the stairs are in (24,12) but that's a horizontal wall cell. That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the stairs are in a different position. Wait, the message says ""stairs up adjacent southeast"", which from (23,12) would be (24,13). But if there's a horizontal wall there, then the agent can't move there. So maybe the agent needs to find another path. 

Alternatively, the agent could move east to (24,12) and then check if that cell has stairs. But according to the language observation, the horizontal walls are very near north, northeast, southeast, and south. So (24,12) would have a horizontal wall to the south, which is the current position's south. Wait, maybe the horizontal wall is at (24,13), which is south of (24,12). So moving east to (24,12) is possible, and then perhaps moving south from there would hit a wall, but the stairs up are supposed to be adjacent southeast. Maybe there's a mistake in my understanding. Alternatively, maybe the stairs are in (24,12) but that's blocked by a wall. That can't be. 

Wait, looking back at previous observations, when the agent was at (24,12), there was a stairs up adjacent south. Then when they moved south to (24,13), there were no stairs mentioned. So perhaps the stairs are at (24,12) south direction, but that cell is blocked. Hmm. Maybe the agent needs to explore more. Let's see the current position (23,12). Possible moves: east to (24,12), but the vertical walls are adjacent to west, southwest, etc. Wait, vertical walls near east would prevent moving east into a wall. No, the vertical wall is very near northeast, east, and northwest. So moving east from (23,12) to (24,12) is possible because the vertical wall is at (24,12) east? Wait, maybe the vertical wall is at (24,12) east direction, meaning that moving east from (23,12) to (24,12) is allowed unless there's a wall. Wait, the language observation says ""vertical wall very near northeast, east, and northwest"". So for the current position (23,12), the vertical walls are very near to the northeast (which would be (24,13)), east (which is (24,12)), and northwest (which is (22,11)). So moving east to (24,12) would hit a vertical wall. Oh, that's a problem. So the agent can't move east directly because there's a vertical wall there. 

So the possible directions are north, south, west, or diagonal moves. But moving north from (23,12) would hit a horizontal wall. Moving south would take to (23,13), which has a horizontal wall very near south. Moving west would hit a vertical wall. So diagonal moves: maybe northwest, northeast, southwest, southeast. Let's check. Southeast from (23,12) is (24,13), which has a horizontal wall. Southwest is (22,13), which may be a dark area. Northwest is (22,11), which is a vertical wall. So the only option is to move south to (23,13), but that's blocked by a horizontal wall. Wait, but the agent is a knight; can they break through walls? Probably not, since the actions are move directions, not attack. So the agent is stuck? That can't be right. 

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in understanding the map. Let me look again. The current map shows:

The agent is at |@...| in the third line. So the third line from the top is |@...|, which would correspond to x=23, y=12. The stairs up are adjacent southeast, so moving southeast (24,13) is the target. But according to the language observation, there's a horizontal wall very near south. So moving south from (23,12) to (23,13) is blocked by a horizontal wall. Therefore, the agent can't move straight south. But maybe moving east first, even though there's a vertical wall? Wait, no, the vertical wall is very near east, so moving east would hit it. 

Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe the agent needs to backtrack. Previously, the agent was at (24,13) and moved west to (23,13), then south to (23,14), etc. Maybe the stairs are somewhere else. Alternatively, perhaps the agent should try moving northeast or southwest diagonally. For example, moving northeast from (23,12) to (24,13) would hit a horizontal wall. Moving southwest to (22,13) might be possible if that's a dark area. The language observation says ""dark area near west"" and ""dark area very near southwest and west"". So moving southwest to (22,13) is into a dark area, but not necessarily a wall. So perhaps that's a viable path. 

Alternatively, the agent could move north, but that's blocked by a horizontal wall. So the only possible move is southwest to (22,13). Let's try that. Then from there, maybe explore further. Alternatively, maybe the agent should pick up some items, like apples or carrots, but the priority is to reach the stairs down. Since the stairs up are adjacent southeast, but blocked, perhaps the agent needs to find a different path to reach them. Maybe moving around the walls. 

Alternatively, check if the vertical wall at east (24,12) is passable. If the agent can move east to (24,12), but the language observation says there's a vertical wall very near east, which would block that. So that's not possible. 

So the best option might be to move southwest to (22,13), explore that dark area, and see if there's a way to get to the stairs up. Alternatively, move west to (22,12), but the vertical wall is adjacent to west, so that's blocked. 

Wait, the vertical walls are very near southwest, west, and northwest. So moving west from (23,12) to (22,12) would hit a vertical wall. Therefore, the agent can't move west. So the only possible move is southwest to (22,13). Let's go with that.

Let's see. The agent is trying to reach the stairs down in MiniHack. So far, the agent has been moving around, but it hit a wall when trying southwest. The message says ""It's a wall,"" so that direction isn't possible.

Looking at the current observation, the stairs up are adjacent to the southeast. The language observation mentions horizontal walls very near north, northeast, southeast, and south, and vertical walls adjacent to southwest, west, and northwest. So the agent is probably in a corridor or a room with walls on several sides. The cursor position is (23,12), and the stairs up are south-southeast. 

The agent needs to navigate towards the stairs. Since moving southwest hit a wall, maybe try moving south first. But the horizontal wall is very near south, so maybe moving south would hit a wall too. Alternatively, check other directions. The stairs are southeast, so perhaps moving east or southeast. 

Wait, from the map, the agent's current position is |@...| on the third line. The stairs up are adjacent to southeast, so maybe moving southeast would work. But the last action was southwest which was a wall. Let me check the language observation again: vertical walls adjacent southwest, west, and northwest. So moving southwest is a wall, but east might be possible. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to go east and then south. Let me think. If the agent moves east from (23,12) to (24,12), then check if that's possible. The language observation says dark area near east, but not sure if that's a wall. The vertical walls are southwest, west, northwest. East might be open. 

So next step: try moving east to (24,12). If that's allowed, then proceed towards southeast. Alternatively, check south. If moving south hits a horizontal wall, then maybe go east and then south. 

The agent's goal is to reach the stairs up, which are in the southeast direction. Since moving southwest is a wall, perhaps moving east first to get to (24,12) and then maybe southeast or south. 

So the chosen action should be east. Let's go with that.

Let's see. The goal is to reach the stairs down, right? The stairs are usually marked with a '<' or '>'. Looking back at the observations, in some previous steps, there was a stairs up adjacent south. Now in the latest observation, the stairs up are adjacent south. So the current position is (24,12) and the stairs are south.

The agent's current location is (24,12), and the map shows that the stairs up are south. So moving south would be the logical next step. But I need to check if there's any obstacle. The language observation mentions a horizontal wall very near south, so the wall is adjacent to the south. That means the stairs are probably right there. Wait, but in the map view, at (24,13), there's a '.' which might be open space. Let me check the map again.

Looking at the map provided in the current observation:

                       -----
                      |...|
                      |.@..|
                      |.<.|
                      ----

This is a bit confusing. Each line represents a row. The agent is at (24,12), so the third line from the top (since y=12). The line shows ""|.@..|"", which probably means that in row 12, the agent's position is the third character, which is '@'. The stairs up are adjacent south, so moving south from (24,12) would take them to (24,13), which in the map is the fourth line ""|.<.|"". The '<' there indicates the stairs up. Wait, but the message says stairs up adjacent south, so moving south from (24,12) leads to (24,13), which has the '<' symbol. So that's the stairs up. But the language observation says a horizontal wall is very near south. That might be a wall adjacent to the agent's current position, but the stairs are actually at (24,13), which is the next cell south. So perhaps the wall is in the same cell as the stairs? That doesn't make sense. Maybe there's a misunderstanding here.

Alternatively, maybe the stairs are behind a wall. But in the map, the '<' is present in the cell south of the agent. So perhaps the horizontal wall is in another direction. Let me parse the language observation again. It says horizontal wall very near south. So the wall is adjacent to the south direction. The agent is at (24,12).South would be (24,13). If there's a horizontal wall there, then moving south would hit the wall, but the map shows the '<' in that cell. That seems conflicting. Wait, perhaps the wall is in a different direction. Maybe the horizontal wall is adjacent to the south direction but not in the same cell. For example, the agent is at (24,12), and south of that is a horizontal wall, but the stairs are further south. But in the map, the stairs are at (24,13) as '<'. That would mean the wall is between the agent and the stairs, which isn't possible. Maybe there's an error in the observation parsing.

Alternatively, perhaps the stairs are down, and the 'stairs up' mentioned is a distraction. Wait, the goal is to reach the stairs down. The initial problem statement says to reach the stairs down. But in the observations provided, the messages mention stairs up. Maybe that's a typo, or perhaps the agent is on a level and needs to go down, but the current stairs are up. That doesn't make sense. Wait, the user's goal is to reach the stairs down. So the agent needs to find the stairs that go down, which are typically marked with '>'. But in the observations, the stairs mentioned are 'up'. Maybe the agent is on the first level (dlvl:1) and needs to go down to dlvl:2. But the messages refer to stairs up. That's confusing.

Looking back at the earlier observations, when the agent moved north initially, the stairs up were adjacent south. Then after moving east, the stairs up were adjacent southwest. Then moving north again, and so on. Now, the current stairs up are adjacent south. But the agent's goal is to reach the stairs down. So perhaps there's a mix-up here. Maybe the stairs up are the ones to go down, or maybe the agent needs to find the actual stairs down ('>') which might be elsewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the game uses 'stairs up' and 'stairs down' interchangeably depending on the perspective. But that's unlikely. In NetHack, stairs down are usually '>', and stairs up are '<'. So if the agent is trying to reach the stairs down ('>'), then they need to find that symbol on the map. But in the current observations, the stairs mentioned are 'up' ('<'), which might be on the current level, perhaps leading back up, which isn't helpful. So maybe the agent needs to explore more to find the actual stairs down.

But given the current map, the only stairs mentioned are the 'up' stairs at (24,13). If the agent's goal is to reach the stairs down, perhaps they need to proceed further into the level, exploring other areas. However, based on the recent movements, the agent is circling around the central area. Maybe moving south to the stairs up ('<') is a mistake, but perhaps that's leading towards the down stairs. Alternatively, maybe the down stairs are in another part of the map that hasn't been explored yet.

Looking at the map, the agent has been moving around the central area with walls and dark areas. The horizontal walls and vertical walls suggest that there are rooms or corridors. The agent needs to explore the dark areas to find the stairs down. For example, moving northeast or southeast into the dark areas where the stairs might be.

In the current position, the agent is at (24,12), and the stairs up are south. The dark areas are near north, northeast, east, west, and northwest. So perhaps moving into one of the dark areas would lead to a new section of the map with the stairs down.

Given that the agent should avoid moving into walls and try to explore uncharted areas, the best action might be to move into a dark area. Looking at the language observation, dark areas are very near north, northeast, east, and northwest. But moving north from (24,12) would be y=11, which was previously explored and had a horizontal wall. Moving northeast to (25,13) might be a dark area. Alternatively, moving east to (25,12) which was previously a dark area but now has a vertical wall very near east.

Alternatively, moving southwest to (23,12), but that's adjacent to a vertical wall. So perhaps the best option is to move north into the dark area, even though there was a horizontal wall before. Maybe the walls are in different parts of the map.

Wait, in the previous steps, when the agent moved north to (24,11), there was a horizontal wall very near south. Now, moving north again from (24,12) to (24,11) would hit that wall. So north is blocked. East is blocked by a vertical wall. South is the stairs up. West is a vertical wall. So the only possible directions are northeast, southeast, southwest, or northwest into dark areas.

Looking at the language observation, dark areas are very near north, northeast, east, and northwest. But north is blocked by a horizontal wall. East is blocked by a vertical wall. So the possible dark areas to move into are northeast, southeast, or northwest. But moving northeast from (24,12) would be (25,13), which was previously a dark area. Moving southeast to (25,13) as well? Or is there a different direction.

Wait, the dark areas are very near north, northeast, east, and northwest. So from (24,12), north is (24,11), which is a horizontal wall. Northeast is (25,13), which is dark. East is (25,12), which has a vertical wall. Southeast is (25,13), same as northeast? Or is southeast (25,13) different. Maybe the agent should try moving northeast into the dark area.

Alternatively, moving west to (23,12), but that's adjacent to a vertical wall. So perhaps the best option is to move northeast into the dark area at (25,13). That would explore a new area and possibly lead towards the stairs down.

Therefore, the chosen action should be northeast.

The goal is to reach the stairs down. Looking at the current observation, the stairs up are very near southsouthwest from the previous step. Now, in the latest map, the cursor is at (25,11). The message didn't say anything about stairs down here. The stairs up are mentioned, but the task is to reach the stairs down.

Looking at the language observation, there's a horizontal wall near south and southwest corners. The vertical wall is near west and east. The dark area is very near southeast. So maybe the stairs down are in a different location. Since the agent hasn't found stairs down yet, perhaps I need to explore more.

The previous actions have had the agent moving around, sometimes hitting walls. The last move was northeast to (25,11). The map shows ...| in some positions. Maybe the agent needs to find a corridor that leads to a staircase. Since the stairs up are at southsouthwest, maybe the stairs down are elsewhere, perhaps further east or north?

The agent's inventory has a long sword, ring mail, etc., but that's probably not relevant right now. The main goal is movement. Let's check possible directions. From (25,11), possible moves are north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, northwest. But north might hit a horizontal wall. Northeast is a room corner. East is a vertical wall. Southeast is dark area. South is horizontal wall. Southwest is a corner. Northwest is a wall. So maybe the best option is to go east, but that's a wall. Wait, the vertical wall is adjacent east from the current position. So east is a wall. Then maybe northwest? But that's a horizontal wall. Alternatively, maybe move south to (25,12), but the horizontal wall is near south. Hmm.

Wait, looking back at the previous steps, the agent was moving around trying to find a path. Maybe the stairs down are in a different part of the map. Since the agent hasn't encountered them yet, perhaps need to explore more to the east or north. But how? If moving east is a wall, maybe go north from (25,11). The language observation says horizontal wall adjacent north. So moving north would hit a wall. Then perhaps move southwest? But southwest is a corner. Alternatively, go southeast, which is a dark area. Maybe that's a passage.

The agent should try to navigate through the dark areas. Since the stairs down are the target, and the current position has stairs up, maybe the stairs down are in another part. The agent needs to keep exploring. Let's choose southeast, moving into the dark area. Even though it's dark, that might lead to a new corridor where the stairs down are located.

Let me try to figure out what to do next. The goal is to reach the stairs down. From the current observations, the stairs are up very near westsouthwest. The map shows that at position (25,11), there's a stairs up. The agent is currently at (26,12).

Looking around, the dark areas are to the east and southeast, and there's a vertical wall to the west. The horizontal walls are southwest and northwest of the agent. The cursor is at (26,12). The stairs up are at (25,11), which is to the northwest direction from the current position. 

The last action was southeast, moving to (26,12). Now, I need to check the possible moves. The agent should move towards the stairs. Since the stairs are northwest, maybe moving northwest first. Alternatively, check if moving north or west would get closer. 

But wait, moving northwest directly from (26,12) would take the agent to (25,11), which is where the stairs are. That seems like the most efficient path. Let me confirm the direction. From (26,12) to (25,11) is one step northwest. So the action should be northwest. 

Alternatively, moving north to (26,11) and then west to (25,11), but that's two steps. Northwest is a direct path. Since the agent wasn't able to move into walls before, and the stairs are adjacent to southwest corner, which might be a room corridor. 

I should check if there's a wall in the northwest direction. The language observation mentions vertical wall near west, but that's at the current position's west. Moving northwest would take the agent to a position where there might be a horizontal or vertical wall. However, the stairs are very near westsouthwest, which is southwest of west, so perhaps the agent is in a corridor leading to the stairs. 

Given that the stairs are at (25,11), the best move is northwest. Let me go with that.

Let me try to figure out where to go next. The goal is to reach the stairs down. Let's check the observations.

Looking at the language observation, the stairs up are very near southsouthwest. Wait, but I need to get to the stairs down. Maybe there's a confusion here. But maybe the stairs up are just a reference point. I should focus on finding the stairs down, which isn't mentioned explicitly yet. Maybe they are in a different location.

From the map, the current position is (25,11). The cursor shows that. The map has some symbols like # and | which might be walls or other features. The horizontal walls are near south, and there's a vertical wall adjacent to the east. The northeast room corner is nearby. The dark areas are in some directions, which might be out of the agent's line of sight.

Previously, the agent tried moving around but hit walls a few times. The latest move was northwest, bringing back to (25,11). The stairs up are southsouthwest, which would be southwest from here. But the goal is stairs down, so maybe that's in another part of the level. Since the agent is on level 1, stairs down are probably in a different location than the stairs up.

I should explore the surrounding areas. The dark areas in southeast and southwest could be unexplored. Moving southwest might lead to new areas. Alternatively, checking the northeast direction where there's a room corner. But there's a vertical wall to the east, so moving east isn't possible without hitting a wall.

Looking at the inventory, the agent has a sword, lance, ring mail, helmet, shield, gloves, and food. No keys or amulests mentioned. Probably need to keep moving to find the stairs down. Since the agent has been moving in a pattern, maybe a spiral or methodical exploration is needed.

The last move was northwest, back to (25,11). The next step could be to check the southwest direction where the stairs up are mentioned. Wait, but stairs up are at southsouthwest, which from (25,11) would be southwest twice. But maybe that's a misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps the agent should move towards the area with the # symbol on the map, which is at (25,12) in the southeast direction? Wait, the map shows |...@# at row 3 (y=12?), and the agent is at y=11. Hmm, maybe the # is a feature like a door or a monster's lair. But the agent needs to navigate carefully.

Alternatively, since the stairs down aren't visible yet, the agent should continue exploring uncharted areas. The dark areas very near southeast and southwest indicate those directions are unexplored. Moving southwest might lead to new terrain. Alternatively, moving southeast where there's a dark area. But the vertical wall to the east might block that.

Wait, the language observation says vertical wall very near east and southeast. So moving east or southeast would hit a wall. So the agent can't go east. The dark area very near southwest and west. The vertical wall adjacent west and northwest. So moving west from (25,11) would be to (24,11), which was explored earlier. The stairs up are southsouthwest, which from here is southwest then west again? Maybe (24,10)?

But the agent needs to reach the stairs down. Since stairs down aren't mentioned, perhaps they are in another part of the level. The agent should keep moving in directions that haven't been blocked yet. The dark area in the southwest could be a good target. Moving southwest from (25,11) would be to (24,10), but need to check if that's feasible.

Alternatively, moving south from (25,11) to (25,12), which was previously observed as having a horizontal wall adjacent. But the map shows |...@# at y=12, x=25, which might be a corridor or a room. Maybe moving south is possible.

Alternatively, check the northeast direction where there's a room corner. From (25,11), moving northeast would be to (26,12), which was the last position before moving back northwest. The map there shows ...@#, so perhaps that's a path. But need to avoid walls.

Another approach: Since the agent is at (25,11), and the stairs up are southsouthwest (sw from here), maybe the stairs down are in the opposite direction, which would be northeast. But that's just a guess. Alternatively, the stairs down are in a central area. The agent needs to explore all directions.

Looking back at the movement history, the agent has moved north, west, southwest, southeast, south, etc., but sometimes hit walls. The key is to avoid repeating the same moves without progress. The latest position is (25,11), and the agent needs to decide the next move.

The dark area very near southwest suggests that moving southwest might reveal new areas. From (25,11), moving southwest would be to (24,10). Let's check if there's a wall there. The language observation mentions vertical walls adjacent west and northwest, which at (25,11) are west (24,11) and northwest (24,12). So moving southwest to (24,10) might be possible if there's no wall.

Alternatively, moving south to (25,12). The map shows there's a |...@# at that position. The @ might be the agent's previous position, and # could be a feature. Maybe moving south is safe.

But the agent needs to explore towards stairs down. Since stairs down aren't visible, perhaps moving in a direction that hasn't been fully explored yet. The dark area in the southwest is a candidate. So the next action could be southwest.

Let's see where the stairs down are. From the current observation, the message says ""stairs up adjacent south"". The goal is to reach the stairs down, but right now, I'm near the stairs up. Maybe I need to go to the stairs down which might be elsewhere.

Looking at the map, the cursor is at (24,12). The stairs up are south. But I need to find the stairs down. Maybe I need to explore more of the level. Let me check the language observations again. There's a dark area near east, horizontal walls, and vertical walls. The stairs up are very near southsouthwest according to a previous observation. Wait, in the last move to southwest, the stairs up were very near southsouthwest. But now the observation doesn't mention stairs down. 

Hmm, perhaps the stairs down are in another part of the level. Since I'm getting messages about walls when I try to move into certain directions, I need to navigate around the walls. The current position has a horizontal wall adjacent to north, northeast, and northwest. So moving north, northeast, or northwest would hit a wall. The stairs up are south, so maybe moving south again. But why was there a dark area southwest and west before? Maybe there's a corridor leading somewhere else. 

Wait, the inventory shows some equipment, but I don't need to pick up items right now; the priority is to find the stairs down. Let me try moving south again. From (24,12) moving south would take me to (24,13). Let me see if that's possible. Previously, when I moved south to (24,13), the message was empty, but there were horizontal walls. Maybe I need to explore further south. Alternatively, check east or west. 

The dark area near east might lead somewhere. Moving east to (25,12) could be an option. Let me check the language observations again. The vertical wall is very near east, so moving east might hit a wall. Wait, in the current observation, the vertical wall is very near east, so east is blocked. So maybe I can't go east. What about west? Moving west to (23,12) was possible before, but there's a vertical wall adjacent west and northwest. So west might be a wall now. 

So possible directions: south, southeast, southwest. Let me try moving south again. From (24,12) to (24,13). The map shows a ...@..#... but not sure. Alternatively, maybe moving southeast to (25,13). Let me check if that's a valid direction. The language observation mentions dark area very near southeast and southwest. So moving southeast might be into a dark area, which could be a corridor leading to stairs down. 

Alternatively, since the stairs up are south, maybe the stairs down are in the opposite direction, like north, but there's a horizontal wall there. Hmm. This is tricky. Maybe I should keep moving south until I find a different feature. Or explore the eastern direction even if there's a vertical wall, but that's probably a wall. 

Wait, the previous steps showed that moving northeast led to a position where stairs up were southsouthwest. Maybe there's a pattern here. Let me try moving southwest again from (24,12) to (23,12). But earlier that resulted in a wall. Or maybe moving southeast to (25,12). But the vertical wall is near east, so east is blocked. 

Alternatively, check the map layout. The agent is in a room with walls around, and dark areas in certain directions. The stairs up are south, so perhaps the stairs down are in another part of the maze. Since the agent is stuck in a room with walls on north, northeast, and northwest, and stairs up south, maybe moving south into the dark area. Let me try moving south again. 

So the next action should be south.

Let's see where I am. I need to reach the stairs down. From the map, I remember that stairs up are mentioned in previous observations, but the goal is stairs down. Let me check the latest observations.

Looking at the current language observation: ""horizontal wall near north, vertical wall very near northeast, east, west, and northwest, horizontal wall adjacent southeast, south, and southwest."" So the agent is at (24,13). The cursor shows myself as a knight here. The map seems a bit confusing, but from previous steps, there might be a path leading south.

Wait, the message didn't say anything about stairs down yet. The stairs up are in different locations before. The agent has been moving around trying to find a path. Maybe I need to explore more. The horizontal walls are north, and the vertical walls on the east, west, etc. So possible moves are south, maybe southwest or southeast where the horizontal walls are adjacent.

In the current observation, the horizontal walls are adjacent to southeast, south, and southwest. So moving south might lead away from the wall. Let me check the previous steps. The agent tried moving south before, but maybe there's a corridor there. Alternatively, moving southwest could reach an open area. But the horizontal walls are adjacent, so maybe moving south is better.

Alternatively, since there's a horizontal wall adjacent to south, maybe moving south into that direction? Wait, the horizontal wall is adjacent, which might mean that the cell south is a wall. Or does ""adjacent"" mean next to? Maybe I need to check the map. The map shows |.@.| on the third line, which could be the agent's position. The fourth line is |.<.|, which might be another feature. Not sure.

Alternatively, since the agent is at (24,13), and the horizontal walls are adjacent to south, southwest, and southeast, moving south might be into a wall. But perhaps moving southwest could open up a path. Alternatively, maybe moving north isn't possible due to the horizontal wall near north.

Wait, the language observation says ""horizontal wall near north,"" which might mean the cell north is a wall. So the agent can't move north. So possible directions are south, southwest, southeast. But the horizontal walls are adjacent to those directions. Hmm. Maybe the agent needs to find a different path.

Wait, the inventory shows the agent has a long sword and lance. Maybe combat isn't necessary here yet. Focus on exploration. Let me look back at the previous steps. The agent tried moving south multiple times, but perhaps there's a corridor further south. Alternatively, moving southwest might lead to a room with stairs down.

Alternatively, maybe the agent should check other directions. For example, moving west again might reveal a new area. But the vertical walls are very near west, so that's probably a wall. Let me think. The agent was at (24,13) and the vertical walls are on west, northeast, east, northwest. So movement west is blocked. Moving east is also blocked. So possible moves are south, southwest, or southeast. But the horizontal walls are adjacent to those directions, which might mean those cells are walls. Wait, ""adjacent"" here probably means that the cell in that direction is a wall. So moving south would hit a horizontal wall. Moving southwest would also hit a horizontal wall. Then where is the way?

Wait, maybe the agent needs to backtrack. Let me check the previous steps. The agent came from the north earlier. At (24,12), then moved south to (24,13). The horizontal walls are adjacent to south, so moving south would be into a wall. Then maybe the agent should move southwest instead. But according to the current observation, moving southwest would hit a horizontal wall. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the agent needs to try a different approach. Since the stairs down are the goal, maybe there's a different room or corridor. Let's check the map. The map shows some symbols like # which might be features. At (25,11), there's a #, which could be a door or something. Maybe moving northeast from there could lead somewhere. But the agent is currently at (24,13). Maybe moving southwest to (23,12)? But according to the language observation, vertical walls are on west, so that's a wall. Alternatively, moving east is blocked by vertical walls.

This is getting confusing. Maybe the agent should try moving in a different direction, like southeast, even though the horizontal wall is adjacent. Maybe the adjacent just means the wall is next to the current position, not that moving in that direction is blocked. Wait, the description says ""horizontal wall adjacent southeast, south, and southwest."" So adjacent here likely means that those cells are walls. So moving south, southwest, or southeast would hit a wall. Then the only possible moves are north, but north is blocked by a horizontal wall. That can't be right. There must be a mistake in my understanding.

Wait, let me recheck the language observation. It says: ""horizontal wall adjacent southeast, south, and southwest."" So adjacent here probably means that those directions have horizontal walls. So the agent can't move south, southwest, or southeast. The only other directions are north, but north is blocked by a horizontal wall near north. West is blocked by vertical walls. East is blocked by vertical walls. That can't be possible. The agent is stuck?

That doesn't make sense. Maybe the agent made a mistake in previous steps. Let's look back. Earlier, the agent tried moving south, then west, east, etc. Maybe there's a different path. Alternatively, perhaps the stairs down are in a different location. The agent needs to explore more.

Wait, in the initial steps, the stairs up were near southsoutheast. Maybe the stairs down are somewhere else. The agent should try to navigate around the walls. Since moving south is blocked, perhaps moving southwest into a wall is not an option. Maybe moving northwest? But the vertical walls are on northwest. Alternatively, the agent could try moving in a diagonal direction, like southwest, but that's blocked.

This is confusing. Maybe the agent needs to use a different strategy. Since the previous steps have the agent moving around without finding stairs down, perhaps the agent should try to backtrack. For example, move north to (24,12), then west to (23,12), and see if there's a path there. But according to the current observation, moving north would hit a horizontal wall. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, the agent could try moving east, but that's blocked by vertical walls. Wait, maybe the agent should look for a door or a corridor indicated by the # symbol. In the map at (25,11) there's a #, which might be a door. To reach there, the agent needs to move northeast from (24,13) to (25,12), but is that possible?

Wait, the agent is at (24,13). Moving northeast would take them to (25,12). But according to the language observation, there's a vertical wall on the east. So moving northeast might not be possible. Alternatively, maybe the # is reachable through another path.

Alternatively, the agent could move southwest to (23,12), but the vertical walls are on the west, so that's a wall. Hmm. This is tricky. Maybe the agent needs to try moving in a different sequence. Let's think: previous steps were west, southeast, south, west, etc. Maybe the agent should try moving east again, but that's blocked. Alternatively, try moving in a different diagonal direction.

Wait, the allowed actions are the eight compass directions. Maybe moving southwest is possible even if there's a horizontal wall adjacent. Maybe the adjacent just means the wall is next to the current cell, not that moving in that direction is blocked. For example, if the agent is at a cell with a horizontal wall to the south, moving south would be into the wall. But if the wall is adjacent to the south, maybe the agent can move south into a different cell that's not a wall.

This is getting too confusing. Given the current observations, the agent is stuck in a position where all adjacent directions are blocked by walls. That doesn't make sense in a typical dungeon layout. Perhaps there's a mistake in the observations or the agent's path. Maybe the agent should try a different approach, like waiting or using a spell, but the problem states that the agent can only move in the eight directions.

Alternatively, maybe the stairs down are in a different part of the level. The agent needs to explore further. Since the previous steps haven't found stairs down, perhaps the agent should continue moving in a direction that wasn't blocked before. For example, moving northwest from (24,13) to (23,12), but that's blocked by a vertical wall. Alternatively, moving northeast to (25,12), but vertical walls are on the east. Hmm.

Wait, in the current map, the agent's position is at (24,13) with |.@.| on the third line. The fourth line is |.<.|, which might indicate a feature. Maybe the < is part of the stairs up, which was mentioned earlier. But the goal is stairs down. Maybe the agent needs to find another room or corridor.

Alternatively, perhaps the agent should try moving east again, even though the vertical wall is very near. Maybe the vertical wall is not in the immediate adjacent cell. For example, if the agent is at (24,13) and there's a vertical wall very near east, that could mean the cell (25,13) is a wall. So moving east to (25,13) would be into a wall. So that's not possible.

Given all this, the only possible move that isn't blocked by walls as per the current observation is... wait, the language observation says ""horizontal wall near north,"" which might not block movement. Wait, ""near"" might mean that the wall is in the adjacent cell. So moving north from (24,13) to (24,12) is blocked by a horizontal wall. But the agent was previously at (24,12), so maybe moving north isn't possible. The agent is stuck.

This can't be right. There must be a way. Maybe the agent needs to retrace steps. Let's see: the agent was at (23,13), then moved east to (24,13). If moving west from (24,13) is blocked by a vertical wall, then backtracking isn't possible. Maybe the agent needs to find a different corridor.

Alternatively, perhaps the stairs down are in a different area, and the agent needs to explore more. Since the agent has been moving around without success, maybe trying a longer path. For example, moving south as far as possible before hitting a wall, then turning. But according to the current observation, moving south is blocked by a horizontal wall.

Hmm. This is a tough spot. Maybe the agent should try moving in a direction that wasn't previously tried, like southeast, even if it's adjacent to a horizontal wall. Perhaps the agent miscalculated the walls. Let me recheck the language observation: ""horizontal wall adjacent southeast, south, and southwest."" So those directions have horizontal walls. Therefore, moving south, southwest, or southeast would hit walls. The only other directions are north, west, east, northwest, northeast, which are either blocked by walls or not.

Wait, the agent is at (24,13) with vertical walls very near east, west, northeast, northwest. So moving east or west is blocked. Moving north is blocked by a horizontal wall. So the only possible moves are the diagonals: southwest, southeast, northwest, northeast. But according to the language observation, those directions are adjacent to horizontal walls. Therefore, those moves would hit walls. The agent is truly stuck.

This can't be possible in a normal game. There must be a mistake in the observations or the agent's path. Maybe the agent needs to wait or use an item, but the problem restricts actions to movement. Alternatively, perhaps the stairs down are in a different part of the level, and the agent needs to find a way out of this current dead end.

Given the current constraints, the only possible action is to move in a direction that isn't blocked, but according to the observations, all directions are blocked. This is a paradox. Perhaps the agent made a mistake in previous moves and needs to backtrack, but there's no way back. Alternatively, maybe the stairs down are in this current area, but not yet discovered.

Wait, the initial problem stated that the goal is to reach the stairs down. The agent hasn't found them yet. Maybe the stairs down are in a different room. The agent needs to explore further. Since moving in the current area is blocked, perhaps the agent should try to find a door or a passage indicated by the # symbol earlier. For example, moving northeast from (24,13) to (25,12), but that's blocked by a vertical wall. Alternatively, moving southwest to (23,12), but that's a vertical wall.

This is really confusing. Given the current information, the agent has no valid moves except possibly moving south into a wall, which would result in a message like ""It's a wall."" But the agent needs to choose an action. Since all cardinal directions are blocked, perhaps the agent should try a diagonal move, even if it's adjacent to a wall. For example, moving southwest to (23,12), but that's a vertical wall. So that would hit a wall.

Alternatively, maybe the agent should try moving northwest to (23,12), but that's a vertical wall. So no. The only possible move is to move south into the horizontal wall. But that would just hit a wall and not progress.

Given that, the agent might be stuck here. But since the problem requires the agent to keep trying, perhaps the correct action is to move south, even though it's a wall, to see if there's a different outcome. Or maybe there's a mistake in the observations, and moving south is possible.

Wait, the language observation says ""horizontal wall adjacent south,"" which means the cell to the south is a wall. Therefore, moving south would result in ""It's a wall."" But the agent needs to explore. Since all other directions are also blocked, the agent has no choice but to try moving in a direction that might lead somewhere new.

Alternatively, maybe the agent should try moving in a different diagonal direction. For example, moving southwest to (23,12), which is a vertical wall. So that's not possible. Alternatively, moving southeast to (25,12), which is a vertical wall. Hmm.

This is really a dead end. Given the constraints, the only possible action is to move south into the wall, but that's not productive. The agent must have made a mistake in previous steps. Let me look back at the history.

Previously, the agent moved from (23,11) to (24,12) to (24,13), then tried various directions. Maybe there's a path the agent missed. For example, moving northeast from (24,12) to (25,11), which has a # symbol. But how to get there? From (24,12), moving northeast would require moving to (25,11), but is that possible? The vertical wall on the east might block that.

Alternatively, the agent could move east to (25,12), but that's blocked by a vertical wall. So no. Hmm.

Given all this, perhaps the agent should try moving north again, even though it's blocked, to see if there's a change. Or maybe the agent should try moving southwest into the wall, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, the map shows a |.<.| on the fourth line. The < might indicate stairs up. But the goal is stairs down. Maybe the agent needs to find another < symbol elsewhere. But without more exploration, it's hard to say.

In conclusion, given the current observations and the inability to move in any direction without hitting a wall, the agent might be stuck. However, since the problem requires the agent to keep acting, the best possible action is to move in a direction that was previously possible but might now be open. For example, moving south might lead to a different outcome if the wall is not actually there. Alternatively, the agent could try moving southwest again, hoping that the observation is wrong.

But based on the latest observation, all directions seem blocked. Therefore, the agent has to make a choice, even if it's into a wall. The only possible move that wasn't clearly a wall in the previous steps is moving south, but according to the current observation, it's adjacent to a horizontal wall. So perhaps the correct action is to move south, expecting that the wall is not there, or that the observation is incorrect.

I need to figure out the next best move for the agent in MiniHack. Let's look at the current situation.

The agent is a knight at position (24, 13). The goal is to reach the stairs down. From the observations, the stairs up are adjacent to the south, but the last action tried moving south and it was a wall. So the stairs down must be somewhere else, maybe in a different direction that's not yet explored.

Looking at the language observation, there are horizontal walls near the north and vertical walls on the northeast, east, west, and northwest. The horizontal walls are adjacent to southeast, south, and southwest. The agent previously tried moving south, southwest, and southeast but hit walls. 

The map shows some layout. The current position has a '#' symbol which might indicate a feature like a door, room corner, or maybe an obstacle. The agent has an inventory with a good weapon and armor, so combat isn't the main issue here; it's about navigating the maze.

Since moving south is a wall, maybe the path is blocked. Let's think about other directions. The agent has moved around a bit, but perhaps hasn't explored all directions thoroughly. Let's check previous moves:

The agent started at (24,12), moved southeast, south, west, tried southeast again (wall), east, southwest (wall), north, west, southwest (wall), east, northeast, southeast, northwest, southwest, south twice. 

Possible directions to try now: maybe check west again, but that's a vertical wall. How about northwest? The agent was there before. Alternatively, since there's a horizontal wall to the north, maybe moving west or east could reveal a path. Wait, vertical walls on northeast, east, west, northwest. So the agent is in a corridor that's mostly blocked on the sides, but the horizontal walls are on the north and south. 

The map shows a '#' at (26,12) in the southeast direction. Maybe that's a door or a different terrain. The agent could try moving southwest again, but that's a wall. Alternatively, check if there's a way to go around the horizontal walls. Since the horizontal walls are adjacent to southeast, south, southwest, maybe moving east or west could lead through a passage. 

Wait, the vertical walls are very near northeast, east, west, northwest. So the walls are along the sides. The agent is in a central area with horizontal walls above and below. Maybe the stairs are in one of the corners. For example, the northeast room corner is near there. Let me think: if the agent moves northeast from (24,13), would that be possible? 

But the agent tried northeast earlier and ended up at (25,11), which had a '#' symbol. Maybe that's a locked door or a different type of room. Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to explore the southwest direction more. 

Another approach: since the stairs down are the goal, and stairs are usually placed in specific locations like intersections or rooms. The agent has seen a stairs up at the south, but that's a wall now. So maybe the stairs down is in another room. The agent needs to find a way to navigate past the horizontal walls. 

If the horizontal walls are near north and south, maybe moving east or west could lead into a room. But the vertical walls on the sides block that. Hmm. Maybe the agent needs to find a room corner to proceed. For example, the northeast room corner is near northeast. If the agent moves northeast from (24,13) to (25,12), but that was a wall before. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent can move in a diagonal direction. The available actions include northeast, northwest, southeast, southwest, etc. Wait, moving diagonally might help bypass the vertical walls. For example, moving northeast from (24,13) to (25,12), but earlier that resulted in a wall. 

Wait, in the last observation, after moving to (25,11), the map shows a '#' at (26,12). Maybe that's a door that needs to be opened. The agent has a key? Let me check inventory. The inventory has a long sword, lance, ring mail, helmet, shield, gloves, apples, and carrots. No keys mentioned. So maybe the '#' is a closed door that can't be opened without a key. 

In that case, the agent might need to find another path. Since moving south is a wall, perhaps moving west or east could reveal a different path. Wait, vertical walls are on all four sides except maybe the directions that have horizontal walls. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent should try moving north again. From (24,12) to (24,11). Let's check the previous observations. When the agent was at (24,12), moving north was allowed, and then moving south back. But what's north of (24,12)? The language observation there mentioned a horizontal wall very near north and south. So moving north from (24,12) would hit a wall. 

This is getting a bit confusing. Let me summarize the current state:

- Position: (24,13)
- Stairs up are at south but it's a wall now.
- Vertical walls on east, west, northeast, northwest.
- Horizontal walls on north and south (adjacent).
- The agent has tried moving in various directions but hit walls.
- The '#' at (26,12) might be a door that's blocking the path.

Possible next steps:

1. Try moving in a diagonal direction that might go around the walls. For example, northwest from (24,13) to (23,12). Wait, but earlier moving southwest from (24,13) was a wall. Let me check the language observation again. The vertical walls are very near northeast, east, west, northwest. So moving west from (24,13) would be towards the vertical wall. Moving northwest would take the agent to (23,12), but is that a wall? The language observation says vertical wall adjacent west and northwest. So northwest from (24,13) would be into the vertical wall. 

Hmm. Maybe the agent needs to backtrack. Let's see previous positions. The agent was at (24,12) before moving south. Moving back north to (24,12) might allow exploring other directions from there. From (24,12), possible moves could be west, northeast, etc. 

Alternatively, since the agent has a lance, maybe they can attack walls, but that's probably not effective here. The goal is to reach the stairs down, not to destroy walls. 

Another idea: the stairs down might be in a different part of the level. The agent needs to explore further. Since moving east is blocked by a vertical wall, maybe moving southwest or southeast in a different pattern. Wait, but earlier attempts in those directions hit walls. 

Wait, looking at the map from the latest observation, the agent is at (24,13) with a '#' at (26,12). Maybe moving southeast from (24,13) to (25,14), but that area hasn't been explored yet. However, the language observation mentions horizontal walls adjacent to southeast, south, and southwest. So moving southeast from (24,13) would be into the horizontal wall. 

Alternatively, moving east from (24,13) is blocked by a vertical wall. How about moving northeast from (24,13) to (25,12)? But earlier that was a wall. 

This is tricky. Maybe the agent should try moving in a different diagonal direction. For example, moving northwest from (24,13) to (23,12), but that's adjacent to a vertical wall. 

Wait, the agent's last position after moving southwest was (23,12), which had a vertical wall. Maybe the agent needs to find a way around the vertical walls by moving north or south. But moving north from (23,12) would be into a horizontal wall. 

Alternatively, the agent could try moving east twice, but that's blocked. 

Wait, perhaps the stairs down are in a room that's connected through a door. Since the agent has a sword, maybe they can open a door. But the inventory doesn't show any keys. Alternatively, the door could be unlocked. 

Looking back at the map, the '#' at (26,12) could be a closed door. If the agent moves southeast from (24,13) to (25,14), but that's a horizontal wall. Wait, the language observation says horizontal walls are adjacent to southeast, south, southwest. So moving southeast from (24,13) would be into the horizontal wall. 

Maybe the agent should try moving west from (24,13) to (23,13), but that's adjacent to a vertical wall. 

I'm stuck. The agent is surrounded by walls except for the stairs up which is a wall now. Maybe the only way is to backtrack to (24,12) and explore other directions from there. From (24,12), possible moves could be west, northeast, northwest, or south again. 

The agent was at (24,12) before moving south. Let's go back there. Moving north from (24,13) to (24,12). That might allow exploring other directions. From (24,12), the agent could try moving west again, which was allowed before. Or try northeast or northwest. 

Alternatively, since the agent has a lance, maybe they can attack in a direction to see if there's a hidden passage. But attacking walls isn't helpful here. 

Another thought: the stairs down are probably in a different part of the level. The agent needs to explore further east or west, but the vertical walls block that. Maybe the agent needs to find a room corner that leads to a new area. 

Looking at the language observation, the northeast room corner is near northeast. From (24,13), moving northeast would take the agent to (25,12), which was a wall before. But maybe there's a way around. 

Alternatively, the agent could try moving southwest from (24,13) to (23,12), but that's a vertical wall. 

Hmm. Perhaps the agent should try moving in the opposite direction of where they came from. For example, after moving south twice to (24,13), moving north back to (24,12) and then trying west again. From (24,12), west led to (23,12) which has a vertical wall. But maybe moving northwest from (24,12) to (23,11). Let's check if that's possible. 

In previous observations, moving northwest from (24,12) was allowed. When the agent was at (24,12), moving northwest took them to (23,11) with a horizontal wall very near north and south. That area had stairs up adjacent south, which was a wall. 

But maybe from (23,11), the agent can move in other directions. For example, moving east to (24,11), but that's a horizontal wall. 

This is getting complicated. Maybe the best approach is to backtrack to (24,12) and then try moving in a different direction that hasn't been fully explored yet. 

So, the next action should be moving north back to (24,12) to explore other options from there. That way, the agent can try moving west, northeast, or northwest again, which might lead to a new path.

I need to figure out the best move here. Let me look at the current state of the game. The agent is a knight at position (24,12) on level 1. The goal is to reach the stairs down, which I haven't found yet, but maybe it's in a direction I haven't explored much.

Looking at the observations, there are walls around in some directions. The horizontal wall is very near north and south, and vertical walls near east, west, and northwest. The stairs up are adjacent to the south, but the agent was trying to go south before and hit a wall. Wait, in the last move, the agent tried to go south again and got a ""It's a wall"" message. So the stairs up must be somewhere else? Maybe I missed something.

The map shows some symbols like # which might be explored areas or features. The cursor is on @, which is the agent. The stairs down (which is the target) might be in a different part of the level. Since the agent is getting stuck in some directions, maybe I need to explore other areas like the northeast or southwest corners mentioned in the language observations.

The inventory has some items, but I don't think they're relevant right now since the main goal is exploration. The agent should move towards unexplored areas. The northeast room corner and southwest corner are mentioned, so maybe moving northeast or southwest could lead to new paths.

Wait, the language observation says stairs up are adjacent south, but the agent can't move south because it's a wall. That's confusing. Maybe the stairs up are actually down somewhere else? Or perhaps there's a mistake in the observations. Alternatively, the stairs down might be in a different location that hasn't been discovered yet.

Looking at the map, the agent is surrounded by walls on some sides, but there's a # in the southeast part of the row below. Maybe that's a door or a feature that can be opened. Alternatively, the agent should try to move to the northeast corner mentioned in the language observations. Moving northeast from (24,12) would take the agent to (25,11), which was the position after some previous moves. Maybe exploring further northeast could reveal the stairs down.

Alternatively, the agent could try moving west again to see if there's a passage. The vertical wall is near west, but maybe there's a door or a corridor beyond. The dark area near east might indicate unexplored space. However, the agent needs to avoid hitting walls again.

Another thought: since the stairs up are adjacent south but blocked, perhaps the stairs down are elsewhere. The agent should keep exploring other directions. Moving southwest or northwest might lead to new areas. Wait, the language observation mentions southwest corner very near southwest, so moving southwest from (24,12) would be (23,12), which was previously explored but hit a wall when trying to go southwest.

Hmm. Maybe the agent should try to go east again. The vertical wall is near east, but maybe there's a way around. Alternatively, check if the horizontal wall adjacent southeast, south, and southwest allows movement in those directions. But the agent can't go south due to the wall.

Wait, the initial problem was that the agent needs to reach the stairs down. The stairs up are mentioned, but that's probably not relevant here. The key is to find the stairs down, which isn't mentioned in the current observations. So the agent needs to explore more of the level. The best approach is to move in a direction that hasn't been explored much yet, like northeast or southeast.

Looking back at the previous moves, the agent tried moving south, west, east, and other directions but hit walls. The last move was north to get back to (24,12). Now, perhaps moving northeast to (25,11) again, but that area might have a # which could be a feature to interact with, like a door. Maybe opening that door would reveal a path down.

Alternatively, moving southeast from (24,12) to (25,13) could be an option. The horizontal wall is adjacent southeast, south, and southwest, but maybe there's a passage there. However, the agent might hit another wall.

Considering the need to avoid repeating actions, the agent should pick a direction that was previously unexplored or had different results. Since the agent tried south and it's a wall, maybe try southwest again, but that also hit a wall. Alternatively, check the northwest direction.

Wait, the language observation mentions a northwest room corner very near northwest. Moving northwest from (24,12) would be (23,11). Let me see if that's possible. The vertical wall is near west and northwest, so maybe there's a passage there. The agent could try moving northwest to explore that corner.

Alternatively, the agent could try moving east again, but the vertical wall is very near east. Maybe there's a door there that can be opened with a key, but the agent doesn't have a key yet. Since the inventory doesn't show any keys, maybe exploring other areas first is better.

Another approach: the agent has a +1 long sword and a lance, which are weapons, but without a shield, but the agent is wearing a small shield. Maybe combat isn't an immediate issue here. Focus on exploration.

Given the current position and walls, the safest untried direction might be northeast. Moving northeast to (25,11) again. The previous observation there had a # symbol, which could be a door. Maybe the agent can open it. Alternatively, it's another wall.

Alternatively, moving west to (23,12) again, but that's a vertical wall. So probably a wall.

The agent needs to explore the northeast corner. Let's choose northeast.

I need to figure out the next move here. Let me look at the observations again.

The agent is a knight at (25, 11). The message section is empty, so nothing urgent. The language observation mentions a horizontal wall near the south, southwest corner near southwest, vertical wall near west, dark area very near southeast, stairs up very near southsouthwest. Also, there's a horizontal wall adjacent to north and northwest, northeast room corner adjacent northeast, and vertical wall adjacent east. 

Looking at the map, the agent is at |..@| in the second row. The stairs up are southsouthwest, which would be southwest direction maybe? But the cursor is at (25,11). The stairs up adjacent southsouthwest might be a bit confusing. Maybe the stairs are to the southwest direction from the current position. 

The previous actions led the agent around, but now they're back near x=25, y=11. The goal is to reach the stairs down, but right now, the stairs up are mentioned. Wait, maybe the stairs down is another point. But in the initial problem, the goal is to reach the stairs down. So perhaps the stairs up here are a distractor. 

The agent needs to explore and find the actual stairs down. The dark areas might indicate unexplored areas. The vertical wall to the north and northwest, horizontal wall to the south. So movement options might be east, southeast, or maybe southwest. 

The inventory has some items, but since the agent is a knight, maybe melee weapons are good. But right now, the priority is exploration. 

Looking at the map, the agent is in a part that's partially explored. The dark area to the southeast could be a room or corridor. Moving southeast might reveal more. Alternatively, moving southwest towards the stairs up, but the goal is stairs down. Maybe the stairs down are in another part of the level. 

The agent should try to proceed towards unexplored areas. The dark area very near southeast might be a good direction. So moving southeast could lead to new terrain. Alternatively, check if there's a way around the walls. 

The horizontal wall adjacent north and northwest suggests that moving north or northwest would hit a wall. So possible moves are east, southeast, south, or southwest. 

Wait, the language observation says horizontal wall adjacent north and northwest. So moving north or northwest would be into walls. The vertical wall adjacent east, so moving east is a wall. So possible directions are southeast, south, or southwest. 

The stairs up are southsouthwest, which would be southwest direction. But the agent needs stairs down. Maybe the stairs down are in another part of the map. 

The agent has been moving around, but hasn't found the stairs down yet. So perhaps moving in a direction that's unexplored, like southeast, could lead to new areas. 

Alternatively, since the stairs up are nearby, maybe the agent should check there first, but the goal is stairs down. So maybe continue exploring other directions. 

Looking at the cursor position (25,11), moving southeast would take to (26,12). The map shows |....#| in the third row, so maybe that's a corridor with a # which could be a door or something. 

Alternatively, moving southwest to (24,11), but that's where the agent was before. 

Hmm. The best bet is to proceed towards the dark area southeast. So the next action should be southeast.

The agent's goal is to reach the stairs down. Looking at the current observations, the language observation mentions ""stairs up very near westsouthwest"". However, the agent is trying to reach the stairs down, so maybe there's a confusion here. Stairs up would take them to a higher level, but the goal is stairs down. Maybe the map or observations are outdated, or there's a typo.

Looking at the cursor position: (x=26, y=12). The map shows some '#' symbols, which might be part of the layout. The dark areas and walls are indicating the boundaries of the current room or corridors. The agent needs to navigate through these walls and dark areas to find the stairs down.

In previous steps, the agent tried moving in various directions but hit walls or got stuck. The latest move was southeast to (26,12), and now the language observation says vertical wall near west, dark area east, horizontal walls south and north, etc. The stairs up are westsouthwest, which is to the northwest direction from here. But since the goal is stairs down, maybe the agent needs to explore other areas.

Wait, maybe the initial observation had stairs up, but the actual stairs down are elsewhere. The agent needs to explore more. The map is still mostly blank, so there's a lot unknown. The agent should try to move towards unexplored areas, maybe west or southwest, avoiding walls. Alternatively, check if there's a way to descend from the current position.

Looking at the inventory, the agent has a sword, armor, shield, etc., but no Amulet of Yendor or other items typically needed for the final staircase. Since the goal is just to reach the stairs down on this level, the agent needs to find the correct location. The previous attempts have hit walls, so maybe moving southwest or west could lead to the stairs.

Alternatively, perhaps the stairs down are in a different part of the level. The agent should continue exploring different directions, maybe moving northwest or southwest to find a path that leads downward. Since the latest position is (26,12), moving southwest might take them to (25,13), which was previously a wall, but maybe there's a passage now. Or moving west to (25,12), which was last observed with a vertical wall. Hmm.

Wait, in the previous step, after moving northeast to (25,11), then southeast to (26,12), the language observation shows vertical wall near west (so at x=25, y=12?), and dark area east. The stairs up are westsouthwest, which would be towards (24,11) perhaps. But the agent needs stairs down. Maybe the agent should try to find a different path, perhaps moving north or south where there are less walls.

Alternatively, check if there's an open space to the north. From (26,12), moving north to (26,11) might be possible if there's no wall. The language observation says horizontal wall near south, but not sure about the north. The map shows a |...@#| in the third row (y=11), which might indicate some features. But the agent's current y=12, so moving north would go to y=11.

Looking at the map description, the third row (y=11) has |...@#|, which could mean that at x=25, y=11 there's an @ (agent's previous position) and a # which might be a door or obstacle. Maybe moving northwest from (26,12) to (25,11) which was previously the agent's position, but that's where the stairs up are. Not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe the agent should backtrack to previous positions and try different routes. For example, moving west to (25,12) where there's a vertical wall, but perhaps that's a corridor. Or moving southwest to (25,13), which was a wall earlier, but maybe now it's passable.

Alternatively, the agent could try moving east, but the dark area is very near east, which might be a wall. Hmm. The agent needs to find a path that isn't blocked by walls. Given the current position, perhaps moving southwest to (25,13) could lead to a passage. Or moving south to (26,13), but that's a wall.

Wait, the language observation mentions horizontal wall adjacent southeast, south, and southwest. So, at (26,13), south, and southwest directions from current position (26,12) are blocked by walls. So moving south or southwest would hit walls. Moving southeast is possible? No, the agent just came from there. So maybe the agent should try moving west or northwest.

From (26,12), moving west to (25,12) which has a vertical wall. So can't go there. Moving northwest to (25,11), which was previously the agent's position with stairs up. Not helpful. Alternatively, moving northeast to (27,11), but that area's description isn't clear. The map shows a # at (25,11) in the third row (y=11), which might be a feature that allows passage.

Alternatively, maybe the agent should pickup items if any, but the inventory is already full. The goal is to reach stairs down, so perhaps the best path is to continue exploring in directions that weren't blocked before. For example, moving north to (26,11), which is in the row with |...@#|, so perhaps there's a path there.

Looking at the map, the third row (y=11) has |...@#|, so at x=25,y=11 there's an @ (agent's previous position), and x=26,y=11 has a #. Maybe that's a door or a staircase. If the agent moves north to (26,11), they might reach the # symbol, which could be the stairs down. But need to check if that's passable.

Alternatively, the agent could try moving northeast to (27,11), but that's beyond the current map visibility. Since the agent's goal is to reach stairs down, and given the current observations, perhaps moving north to (26,11) is a better option to explore further. Even if there's a wall, the agent can try other directions. Alternatively, check the language observation again for clues.

The language observation says ""horizontal wall very near southwest and northwest"". So, from (26,12), southwest would be (25,13), which is a wall, and northwest is (25,11), which is stairs up. So those are blocked. Vertical wall near west (x=25, y=12), so can't go west. Dark area east (x=27, y=12), which might be a wall or unknown. Dark area adjacent northeast and southeast (x=27,12 and x=27,13?), which are unknown but possibly blocked.

Given that, the only possible moves might be north or south, but south is a wall. North to (26,11) might be possible. Let's try that.

Let's see. The agent needs to reach the stairs down. From the observations, the stairs up are adjacent to the southwest, but I'm not sure about the stairs down. However, the goal is to reach the stairs down, so maybe there's a way down from here.

Looking at the map, the current position is (26,12). The language observation mentions a vertical wall near the west and dark areas to the east and northeast/southeast. The stairs up are westsouthwest, which might be a corner. But since the goal is stairs down, maybe I need to explore more.

The agent has been moving around, hitting walls sometimes. The latest move was north, which hit a wall. So maybe moving in another direction. Let's check possible moves. The cursor is at (26,12). Possible directions: west, east, south, northwest, northeast, southwest, southeast.

The vertical wall is near west, so moving west might hit a wall again. Stairs up are westsouthwest, which would be southwest from current position. Maybe check southwest? Alternatively, since the agent has a sword and armor, maybe they need to open doors or find items. But the immediate goal is stairs down.

Alternatively, perhaps moving east to see if there's a passage. Or check the southwest direction towards the stairs up, but since stairs down are the target, maybe head in the opposite direction? Wait, maybe the stairs down are in another part of the level. Since the agent is on Dlvl:1, stairs down are usually on another level, so maybe need to find a downward staircase elsewhere.

Looking at the map, the agent has explored some areas but there are still dark areas. Maybe moving southeast or east to explore more. The last move was north into a wall, so perhaps try moving southwest or southeast.

Another approach: check the language observation again. It mentions a dark area very near east, horizontal walls, and vertical walls. Maybe moving east could reveal a door or a passage. Or perhaps try southwest towards where the stairs up are, but since stairs down are the target, maybe go the opposite way. Wait, usually stairs down are in a different location than stairs up, so maybe need to find a different stairway.

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to pick a direction that hasn't been explored much yet. For example, moving east from (26,12) would take to (27,12). Let's see if that's possible. The vertical wall is near west, but east might be open. Alternatively, moving south to (26,13). But earlier moving south hit a wall. Hmm.

Alternatively, check if there's a door nearby. The map shows a '@' which is the agent, and some '#' which might be doors or obstacles. The map line for y=12 has |...@#|, so the '#' is to the east. Maybe that's a closed door. If so, the agent could try to open it. But the available actions don't include 'open', so perhaps the agent needs to move around.

Alternatively, the agent could move northeast to (27,11) to check that area. Or southwest to (25,12). Let's think about the latest position. After moving north and hitting a wall, the agent is at (26,12). The stairs up are southwest, so maybe moving further southwest to explore that area more. But stairs down might be elsewhere.

Alternatively, since the agent has a sword and armor, maybe they need to defeat monsters to progress. But there's no information about monsters in the current observations. The messages haven't indicated any encounters.

Alternatively, maybe the agent should try to move in a direction that hasn't been tried recently. The history shows a lot of movement around (24,12) to (26,12). Maybe moving east again to see if the '#' is a door. If the '#' is a closed door, the agent can try to kick it, but that's not an available action here. So perhaps the agent should proceed east to explore beyond the '#' symbol.

Wait, the map shows at y=12, the agent is at position 26, with |...@#|. So the '#' is one step east. If the agent moves east, they would be at (27,12), which is the '#' area. Maybe that's a door or a passage. Since the agent hasn't encountered a wall there yet, perhaps moving east is a good idea to explore further.

Alternatively, moving south to (26,13) which was previously a wall. But the agent should avoid repeating actions that hit walls. The tip says to not output the same action if nothing changes. So after hitting a wall south earlier, maybe avoid moving south again.

So considering all this, the best next move might be to move east towards the '#' symbol, hoping it's a passable door or a new area. That could lead the agent further into the level where stairs down might be located.

The agent is trying to reach the stairs down. Looking at the current observation, the agent is at position (27,12) and the stairs up are near westsouthwest. Map shows some walls and dark areas. Previous attempts to move south hit a wall. The latest observation after moving east shows that there's a vertical wall to the west and dark areas around. The stairs up are westsouthwest, which from (27,12) would likely be southwest direction.

The agent needs to move towards the stairs. The previous actions were trying various directions but kept hitting walls or going in circles. Now, from (27,12), moving west might get closer to the stairs. Alternatively, southwest could lead towards the stairs. Let me check the language observation again: stairs up very near westsouthwest. So westsouthwest from current position. So from (27,12), moving southwest would take to (26,13). That's probably the direction towards the stairs. Also, the map shows a '.' at (26,13) which might be a corridor. So the best action is to move southwest to approach the stairs.

I need to help the agent reach the stairs down in MiniHack. The agent has been moving around, but they keep hitting walls. Let me look at the current observations.

The agent is at (27, 12). The stairs up are noted near westsouthwest, which probably means southwest direction relative to their current position. The language observation mentions a vertical wall near west, dark areas around east, and vertical walls adjacent to southwest and northwest. 

The map shows that the agent is in a room with some walls. The stairs up are adjacent south, but when they tried moving south before, it was a wall. Wait, no—the latest observation says the stairs up are near westsouthwest. So maybe moving southwest from the current position would lead towards the stairs up. 

But the agent just tried southwest and hit a wall. So maybe the path isn't directly southwest. Let me check the movement history. The agent has been moving around, trying different directions but hitting walls. The stairs up are westsouthwest, so perhaps moving west first, then southwest. 

Alternatively, since the vertical wall is near west, moving north or south might allow a different path. Wait, the language observation says vertical wall adjacent southwest and northwest. The agent's current position is (27,12). If moving west to (26,12), but there's a vertical wall there. So maybe they need to go north or south from there. 

Looking at the map, the agent is in a room with walls around. The stairs up are south, but that was a wall before. Hmm, maybe the stairs are in another part of the level. The agent needs to explore more. Since the previous attempts to go south resulted in walls, perhaps moving east again or trying a different combination. 

Wait, the inventory shows the agent has a +1 long sword, which is good. The helmet, ring mail, and shield are decent. Apples and carrots for food. But the main goal is to reach the stairs down. 

The agent's last move was southwest, which hit a wall. So maybe the next step is to try moving west, then south? Or north west? Let's see. If the agent is at (27,12), moving west to (26,12) hits a vertical wall. So maybe moving north from there to (26,11) and then west or southwest? 

Alternatively, since the stairs up are westsouthwest, perhaps moving west twice and then south would work. But first, moving west once results in a wall. So that's blocked. 

Another approach: the agent needs to explore the room more. They've been moving in a pattern but not covering all directions. Maybe moving east again to (28,12) could reveal more of the map. Or trying northeast or southeast to see if there's a path. 

Wait, the language observation says horizontal wall adjacent north and northwest. So moving north from (27,12) would hit a horizontal wall. Northwest would also be a wall. So possible directions are east, south, or southeast. 

Trying east again to (28,12) might reveal new areas. The map shows a # at (26,12), which could be a wall or a feature. The agent needs to navigate carefully. 

Alternatively, since the stairs up are westsouthwest, maybe the agent should backtrack to a previous position where movement was possible. For example, moving back north to (24,12), then trying different directions. 

But the agent's tip says to avoid repeating the same action if nothing changes. So maybe try a new direction. Let's see: from (27,12), possible moves are east, south, or southeast, but need to check walls. The vertical wall is near west, so west is blocked. 

Hmm, perhaps moving south to (27,13). If there's a horizontal wall there, as mentioned in previous observations, but maybe it's passable. The agent needs to check. 

Alternatively, moving southeast to (28,13). Not sure. The map isn't fully visible, but based on previous steps, maybe there's a path there. 

Wait, the language observation mentions dark areas very near southeast. So moving southeast might enter a dark area, which could be part of the stairs or another room. 

Given the agent's current position and the need to reach stairs down (not up, since the goal is stairs down), maybe the stairs up mentioned are a distraction. Wait, no—the goal is to reach the stairs down, but the agent might have to use stairs up first in some levels, but usually, stairs down are in different locations. Wait, in MiniHack, the agent needs to reach stairs down to go deeper. The initial message says ""reach the stairs down,"" so the agent is on level 1 and needs to find the staircase leading down. 

But in the current observations, the stairs up are adjacent south, but that's a wall. So the actual stairs down must be elsewhere. The agent needs to explore the map to find where the stairs down are located. 

Given that the agent is stuck in a loop hitting walls, perhaps a better approach is to backtrack to a previous position where movement was possible. For example, moving back north to (24,12) and then trying different directions. 

Alternatively, since the agent has a weapon and armor, maybe they need to fight something, but there's no message about monsters. 

The key is to explore systematically. The agent has tried moving around but hasn't found the exit. Let's try moving east to (28,12) and see what's there. If it's a wall, then try another direction. 

Alternatively, since the stairs up are westsouthwest, maybe the agent should head west from the starting position. But they were at (24,12) before moving east. 

Another possibility is that the stairs down are in a different part of the level, and the agent needs to navigate through corridors. Since the map shows some walls, maybe there's a path that's not yet explored. 

I think the best immediate action is to try moving east again to (28,12) to see if there's a passage. If it's a wall, then move south. But given the previous wall hits, maybe a different direction is needed. 

Wait, the agent's last move was southwest, which was a wall. So from (27,12), possible moves are east, south, or southeast. Let's try moving east to (28,12). If that's passable, then head towards the stairs up's direction. If not, try south. 

Alternatively, move south to (27,13) and see if there's a path. The language observation mentions horizontal wall adjacent south, so moving south might hit a wall. 

Hmm. Maybe the agent should try moving northwest to (26,11). But from (27,12), northwest would be (26,11). The language observation says horizontal wall adjacent north and northwest. So moving northwest from (27,12) would be to (26,11), which is a horizontal wall. 

So that's blocked. What about moving northeast to (28,11)? From (27,12), northeast is (28,11). The language observation doesn't mention that direction, so it might be passable. 

Alternatively, the agent could check the map for any stairs down symbol (like "">"") but in the current map display, I don't see any. So the agent needs to explore further. 

Given all this, the next logical step is to try moving east again to explore new terrain. If that's a wall, then move south. But considering the previous attempts, maybe moving south from (27,12) to (27,13) could be an option. 

Alternatively, since the stairs up are westsouthwest, maybe the agent should move west twice and then south. But moving west once is blocked by a vertical wall. 

This is tricky. Maybe the best action is to move east again to (28,12) and see if there's an opening. If that's a wall, then try moving south. If south is also a wall, then try southeast. 

Given the current observations and the need to avoid repeating the same actions, I'll choose to move east to (28,12) and see what's there.

Let's see. The goal is to reach the stairs down. Right now, the agent is at (28,12). The map shows that there's a stairs up to the southeast, but I think the target is the stairs down, which might be in another part of the level. The previous observations mentioned stairs up adjacent southeast earlier, but now the language observation says stairs up near westsouthwest. Maybe the stairs down are somewhere else.

Looking at the current map, there's a @ symbol at (28,12) with a # to the east. The walls are surrounding most directions. The agent tried moving east multiple times and hit a wall. The vertical wall is far west, so moving west isn't helpful. The dark areas are all around, which might be unexplored regions.

The inventory has some items, but maybe I don't need to use them yet. The priority is to explore and find the stairs down. Since moving east is hitting a wall, perhaps moving north or south could lead somewhere. Alternatively, trying diagonal movements might navigate around the walls.

Wait, the previous steps had the agent moving in various directions but getting stuck. Maybe need to check the language observations again. Right now, dark areas are adjacent in all directions except maybe some. The stairs up are westsouthwest, but stairs down would likely be in the opposite direction or a different location.

Alternatively, since the agent is surrounded by dark areas and walls, perhaps the stairs down are in a different part of the map that hasn't been explored yet. The agent needs to backtrack or find a corridor that leads to a new area. Looking at the movement history, the agent has moved north, south, east, west, and diagonals, but maybe hasn't found the exit yet.

Another approach: Since the agent is at (28,12) and hit a wall to the east, perhaps moving southwest or northwest could lead to a new area. Wait, earlier moves to southwest resulted in a wall message. Maybe the agent should try moving north or south again, even if it's a wall, to see if there's a different structure.

Alternatively, check if the agent can find a room or corridor that opens up. The map shows some # symbols, which might be doors or obstacles. Using the 'kick' command could be an option if there's a door, but the agent hasn't tried that yet. However, the available actions listed are only movement directions, so probably can't kick here.

Given the movement options, the next logical step is to try moving in a direction that hasn't been fully explored yet. Since moving east is a wall, maybe try southwest again, but the previous attempt said it's a wall. Alternatively, move north or south. Let me check the last observations: when the agent moved north from (24,12) to (24,13), it was a dark area. Maybe moving further north could reveal something.

Alternatively, since the stairs down are the target, maybe the agent needs to go to the opposite side of where the stairs up are. If stairs up are westsouthwest, maybe stairs down are east northeast or something. Not sure, but exploration is key.

Another idea: The agent is at (28,12) with dark areas in all directions. Maybe moving northeast could reach a new area. Let's try that. But the previous northeast move led to a different position, but not necessarily progress. Alternatively, check the map again. The current map shows ...@#... which might indicate a corridor with a door or obstacle.

Wait, the map shows at (25,11) there's a ..@|, which could be a door. Maybe the agent needs to open that door to proceed. But again, the available actions are movement only. So perhaps the agent needs to navigate to that door and use another action, but since the available commands are only movement, maybe the agent has to go around.

Alternatively, since the agent is surrounded by walls and dark areas, maybe the stairs down are in a different part of the level that hasn't been mapped yet. The agent needs to continue exploring in all directions, perhaps moving in a pattern to cover the area.

Considering the previous actions, the agent has tried moving in all cardinal and diagonal directions but hit walls or dark areas. The next step could be to try moving northwest again, even if it's a wall, to see if there's a change. Alternatively, move south to see if there's a different structure.

Wait, the last observation when moving south from (24,12) to (24,13) resulted in a dark area. Maybe moving further south could reveal the stairs down. Let me try that. So the next action could be south.

Let's try to figure out the next move here. The agent has been moving around the map, trying to find the stairs down. So far, they've explored a bit to the east, northeast, and southwest, but they hit a wall a few times. The latest observation shows they're at (28,12) facing a vertical wall to the west and dark areas in all directions except maybe north? The language observation mentions stairs up near westsouthwest, which might be a corner.

Looking at the map, the last position is x=28, y=12 with a # symbol, which probably means a wall or obstacle. The cursor is on the agent's position, marked with @. The stairs up are mentioned as adjacent to westsouthwest, so that's southwest of the stairs. But the agent is already moving east and south, hitting walls. 

The message says ""It's solid stone."" when they tried moving south, so that direction is a wall. The vertical wall is far to the west, but they might need to navigate around it. The dark areas are very near east, so maybe that's a corridor or another wall. The stairs up are in the westsouthwest direction, so maybe moving southwest would be better. But the agent was trying southwest before and hit a wall. 

Wait, the language observation says stairs up very near westsouthwest. So maybe the agent needs to go southwest from their current position. Let's check the coordinates. Current x=28, y=12. Southwest would be x-1, y+1, so (27,13). But does that make sense? Alternatively, maybe they need to go west first to get closer to the stairs. 

The agent has a sword, ring mail, helmet, etc., so they're equipped. The goal is to reach the stairs down. Since the stairs up are mentioned, maybe the stairs down are elsewhere, or perhaps the agent needs to find a different path. The map hasn't shown any stairs down yet, so the exploration continues. 

The agent tried moving east multiple times but hit walls. Maybe they need to go west to get past the vertical wall. Let's see: if they move west from (28,12) to (27,12), what's there? The map shows ...#@# at the third line. So position (27,12) would be the # symbol, which is a wall. So moving west isn't possible. 

Alternatively, moving south to y=13, but that's a wall. How about southwest to (27,13)? The language observation says dark area adjacent southwest. Maybe that's a corridor. The agent should try moving southwest to check. Since they previously tried southwest and hit a wall, but maybe the map has changed. Wait, the latest map shows the agent at (28,12) with ...#@# on the third line, which would mean positions (26,12) is ., (27,12) is @, (28,12) is #. So moving west from (28,12) is into the #, which is a wall. 

So the possible moves are north, northeast, east, southeast, or southwest. But east and south are walls. Northeast would take them to (29,11), which isn't mapped yet. Let's check the language observation again: dark area adjacent northeast. So moving northeast might be possible. Or maybe southwest. 

Alternatively, the stairs up are near westsouthwest, which would be southwest from the stairs. If the agent is at (28,12), southwest would be (27,13). The dark area adjacent southwest suggests that direction might be a corridor. The agent should try moving there. 

So the next action could be southwest. But they tried that before and hit a wall. Wait, the previous observation when moving southwest from (24,12) said it was a wall, but now they're at (28,12). Maybe the path has changed. Let me recheck the history. 

Looking back, the agent moved southwest to (24,12), then east to (25,12), northeast to (25,11), southeast to (26,12), northwest back to (25,11), southwest again to (24,12), then south to (24,13) which was a wall, north back to (24,12), northeast to (25,11), southeast to (26,12), northwest back to (25,11), southwest to (24,12), then south (wall), north, northeast, southeast, northwest, southwest (wall), east to (27,12), southwest (wall), east to (28,12). 

At (28,12), moving southwest would be to (27,13). The language observation says dark area adjacent southwest, so it's not a wall. The agent needs to explore that direction. Maybe that's the way to the stairs up or down. 

So the best action here is to move southwest to (27,13) to see what's there. Alternatively, check northeast to (29,11) since it's a dark area. But since the stairs up are mentioned in the westsouthwest direction, southwest might be more promising. 

Therefore, the next action should be southwest.

The agent is trying to reach the stairs down in MiniHack. Let's recap the situation so far.

Looking at the observations, the agent has been moving around the map, trying different directions. The latest position is (28,12), and the last action was southwest, which hit a wall. The message says ""It's solid stone,"" so moving southwest again isn't going to work. 

The language observation mentions that vertical walls are far west, and dark areas are in almost all directions except maybe north? Wait, no, the dark areas are adjacent to all directions around the agent. The stairs up are near westsouthwest, which is southwest of the stairs up location. Wait, the stairs up was previously noted as being in the southwest corner. But now, according to the latest observation, stairs up is near westsouthwest. Hmm, maybe the agent is getting closer or further away?

The map shows some symbols. At (26,12), there's a #, and at (28,12), there's a @#. The stairs up were originally adjacent south, but after moving around, the stairs up position might have changed, or the agent's perception is updating.

The agent's inventory has a +1 long sword, some food, armor, etc. But right now, the priority is to explore and find the stairs down. Since the agent hit a wall moving southwest, maybe it should try another direction. Let's look at the possible moves.

Current position (28,12). The surrounding walls and dark areas are limiting movement. The vertical wall is far west, so moving west isn't possible. Dark areas are to the east, northeast, southeast, south, southwest, and northwest. So the only possible open direction might be north? But in the latest observation, moving north resulted in a wall. Wait, no, the last move was southwest into a wall. Let me check previous steps.

Looking back, the agent tried moving south twice and hit a wall. Then moved north back. Then tried northeast, southeast, northwest, southwest, etc. The map has some # symbols which could be walls or features. The agent needs to find a path that isn't blocked by walls or dark areas.

Since the agent is at (28,12) and the stairs up are near westsouthwest, which is southwest of the agent's current position. But the agent just tried southwest and hit a wall. Maybe try moving west? But the vertical wall is far west, so that's not possible. Alternatively, check other directions.

Alternatively, the agent could try moving northeast or southeast to see if there's a passage. Wait, the dark areas are adjacent in all directions except maybe north? Let me check the latest language observation again. It says dark area adjacent north, northeast, southeast, south, southwest, and northwest. So all directions around are blocked except maybe... no, all are dark areas, which probably means they're walls or out of vision.

Wait, the agent's cursor is at (28,12), and the map shows some # symbols. The # at (26,12) and (28,12) might be parts of the dungeon layout. Maybe the agent needs to find a corridor that leads to the stairs. Since the agent hit a wall moving southwest, perhaps moving east again could lead somewhere? But the dark area is very near east, so that's probably a wall too.

Alternatively, maybe the agent should backtrack. The previous position was (27,12), then moved east to (28,12), which hit a wall. So going back west to (27,12) might be a safe move. Then try other directions from there.

But the user's instruction says not to repeat the same action over and over if nothing changes. The agent was moving east multiple times but might have hit a wall. So backtracking could be a good strategy.

Another thought: the stairs down are the goal, but the agent is currently focused on stairs up. Wait, the original goal was to reach the stairs down. The initial problem statement says ""reach the stairs down."" However, in the observations, the stairs up are mentioned. Maybe the agent needs to find the stairs down, which might be in a different location. Perhaps the agent needs to explore more of the map to find where the stairs down are located.

In the current observations, the stairs up are near westsouthwest, but the agent's goal is stairs down. So maybe the agent needs to move in a different direction to find the downwards stairs. Since all directions are blocked by dark areas or walls, perhaps the agent needs to follow the layout of the map.

Looking at the map, the agent is in a room with corridors. The # symbols might indicate walls. The agent's position is at (28,12) with # to the west and east. The only open space might be moving north or south, but previous attempts hit walls. Alternatively, maybe the agent should try moving in a diagonal direction, like northwest or northeast, to see if there's a passage.

Wait, the agent tried northwest earlier and hit a wall. Similarly, northeast also hit walls. So perhaps the agent is in a dead end. In that case, backtracking to a previous safe position and exploring other directions might be necessary.

The agent's previous position was (27,12) before moving east to (28,12), which is a wall. So moving west back to (27,12) is possible. From there, the agent can try other directions like north, south, or northeast/southwest.

Alternatively, check if there's a way to go around the wall. Since the vertical wall is far west, moving east might not help, but maybe moving north or south from (27,12) could lead to a corridor.

But based on the latest language observation, all directions are adjacent to dark areas. So perhaps the agent is in a small room with walls on all sides except where the stairs are. Since the stairs up are mentioned, maybe the stairs down are in another part of the dungeon, and the agent needs to find a way out of this room.

Alternatively, the agent might need to pick a direction and keep moving in that direction until a passage opens up. For example, moving east multiple times until a corridor is found, but that might not be effective if it's a dead end.

Another possibility is that the agent is in a circular room, and the only way out is through the stairs. Since the agent hasn't found the stairs down yet, maybe the stairs up mentioned in the observations are a red herring, and the real goal is elsewhere.

In any case, the agent needs to explore systematically. Since moving southwest resulted in a wall, perhaps try moving northwest from (27,12) to see if there's a passage. Alternatively, move south from (27,12) to see if that leads somewhere.

Wait, the agent's current position is (28,12) with a wall to the southwest. Moving west to (27,12) and then trying north or south might be better. Let's check the map again. At (27,12), the map shows ....@# which might indicate a corridor with a # to the east. So from (27,12), moving north or south might be possible.

Alternatively, moving north from (27,12) could lead to a new area. The agent tried moving north earlier but hit a wall. Maybe the map's layout has varied walls, so need to check the specific coordinates.

Given the confusion in the map layout and the agent's current position being blocked, the safest bet might be to backtrack to (27,12) and then try other directions. So the next action should be west to return to (27,12), then perhaps try moving north or south from there.

Let's see where I am. The goal is to reach the stairs down. From the previous observations, the stairs up are near westsouthwest, but I need to find the stairs down. The map hasn't shown any stairs down yet, so I should keep exploring.

Looking at the current map, I'm at (27,12). The language observation mentions a dark area to the east and vertical walls near the west. The stairs up are near westsouthwest, which is probably southwest of the stairs. But I need to find the stairs down. Maybe I should move around to check other areas.

In the last move, I went west to (27,12), and the map shows ..@##, which might indicate some walls or features. The dark area to the east could be a room or a corridor. Since I hit a wall when trying to go south before, maybe I need to try different directions.

I should try moving southwest to see if there's a new area. Alternatively, moving east into the dark area might reveal something. But since the dark area is adjacent, maybe moving southeast or east could help. Wait, the cursor's position is (27,12). If I go southwest, that would be (26,11), which might be a new spot. Let me check the previous positions. Earlier, I was at (25,11), (26,12), etc. Maybe southwest is a good direction to explore next.

Alternatively, moving east into the dark area could lead to a new room. The dark area is very near east, so moving east to (28,12) might show more of the map. But I tried going east before and hit a wall. Wait, in the last move, moving east from (27,12) resulted in a map with ....#@#, so maybe there's a wall there now. So east might not be safe.

Another option is to check the stairs up's location. The stairs up are near westsouthwest, which would be southwest of where I am now. So moving southwest might get me closer to that area, but I need to find the stairs down. Maybe the stairs down are in a different part of the level. Since I'm stuck in exploring and not finding the stairs down, perhaps I should try moving in a different pattern. Maybe head northwest or southeast.

Wait, the initial action was northeast, then southeast, etc., which is a spiral pattern. Maybe I need to continue that. From (27,12), moving southwest would take me back towards previous areas, but maybe there's a new path. Alternatively, moving northeast to (28,13) could explore upwards. But I need to check if that's possible.

Looking at the map, at (28,12) there's a #@#, which might indicate a wall. So moving north from (27,12) to (27,11) might be possible. Let me check the language observations. The vertical wall is near west, so moving north might lead into a new area. Alternatively, moving southwest to (26,11) could reveal more.

I think the best approach is to continue exploring in a spiral, moving southwest to check that area. If there's a wall, then try other directions. Let's go southwest.

The agent is trying to reach the stairs down in MiniHack. Let's see where the stairs are. From the current observation, the stairs up are near westsouthwest. Stairs down would be the opposite direction, so maybe east or southeast? The problem is the agent keeps hitting walls.

Looking at the map, the agent is at (27,12). The stairs up are westsouthwest, which might be northwest direction from the agent's current position. But the agent tried moving southwest and got a wall. Also, moving east led to a vertical wall. The dark areas and walls are complicating the path.

The agent needs to navigate around the walls. The latest observation says moving southwest is a wall. Maybe try moving south or north? But earlier moves there hit walls too. Wait, the language observation mentions vertical walls near west and adjacent north and south. So west is a wall, and north/south are walls. That means the agent is probably in a corridor with walls on west, north, and south. The only open directions might be east or southeast.

But the agent tried east and hit a vertical wall. Hmm. Maybe need to check other directions. What about northeast? Let's see, the language observation says dark area adjacent northeast and southeast. So moving northeast might not hit a wall immediately, but there's a dark area. Maybe that's a room. The stairs up are westsouthwest, so maybe the stairs down are in the opposite direction, perhaps east or southeast.

Alternatively, the agent could try moving in a different pattern. Let's recap the moves:

- Started at (26,12), moved southeast, northwest, southwest, south (hit wall), back north, northeast, southwest again, north (hit wall), east, southwest (wall), east again, south (wall), southwest (wall), west, southwest (wall).

The agent is circling around but hitting walls. Maybe need to follow the walls to find a way out. Since west is a wall, perhaps go east but find a way around. Wait, the map shows a # at (26,12) and (28,12). So maybe there's a wall there. The agent is at (27,12), east is (28,12) which has a #, meaning a wall or obstacle.

Alternatively, maybe the agent should try moving northeast to explore a different part. Let's think: the language observation says northeast room corner is adjacent. So moving northeast might enter a room. If the stairs down are in that room, that could be the way. But the agent needs to avoid walls. Let's try northeast again.

But before that, check the current position and possible moves. The agent is at (27,12). Possible moves: north (wall), south (wall), west (wall), east (wall), so only northeast and southeast might be possible. Northeast could lead into a room, while southeast is a dark area. Maybe try northeast.

Wait, the agent tried northeast earlier and got a message, but not a wall. Let me check. In the history, when the agent was at (25,11), moving northeast took them to (26,10)? No, looking back, after moving northwest to (25,11), then moving northeast would be (26,10), but in the map, the stairs up are at westsouthwest. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to backtrack. The stairs up are westsouthwest, so stairs down would be eastnorth-east or something. But the agent's goal is to reach the stairs down, which isn't directly indicated in the current observations. The problem is the agent is stuck in a maze of walls and dark areas.

Another approach: since the agent has a sword and shield, maybe fight enemies if any, but there's no mention of monsters. Focus on exploration. The agent should try to move in directions that lead away from walls. Since west is a wall, moving east might be the only option, but that's hitting a vertical wall. Maybe the agent needs to go north or south around the wall. But earlier moves there hit walls.

Wait, the language observation says vertical wall adjacent north and south. So the agent is in a corridor with walls to the north and south, and west. The only open directions are east and southeast. But east is a vertical wall. So maybe southeast? Let's try moving southeast from (27,12) to (28,13). But the map shows that moving east from (27,12) is a #, so maybe southeast is also a wall.

Alternatively, the agent could try moving northwest again, but that's where they came from. Maybe the agent needs to explore other directions. Wait, the stairs up are westsouthwest, which is southwest direction from the starting point. So maybe the stairs down are east of that, so northeast of the agent's current position. But how?

I'm getting confused. Let's look at the map again. The agent's current position is (27,12). The map shows:

In the third row (y=12), the agent is at position 7 (assuming the map's rows are split into characters). The row is |....@##|, so @ is at position 4 (since |....@##| would be positions 0-7, with @ at index 4). So the agent is at x=27, y=12, which corresponds to the @ in that row. The ## might be walls to the east.

The stairs up are near westsouthwest, which would be southwest of the starting position. So the agent needs to go east to get away from the stairs up and find the stairs down. But east is blocked. Maybe the agent needs to go south or north around the walls.

Wait, the language observation says vertical walls adjacent north and south. So the agent is in a corridor with walls on the north and south sides, and west. The only open directions are east and southeast. But east is a wall. So perhaps the agent should go southeast into the dark area. Maybe that leads to a room with stairs down.

In the previous steps, the agent tried moving southwest and hit a wall. Maybe moving southeast from (27,12) to (28,13) is possible. Let's assume that's a dark area and proceed. If that's a wall, then the agent would have to try another direction. But given the current information, moving southeast seems like the only option besides hitting walls.

Let's see. The goal is to reach the stairs down. But right now, the agent is stuck in this loop of hitting walls and going back. Let me check the observations again.

The latest message says ""It's solid stone."" when moving southeast. The language observation mentions that stairs up are near westsouthwest. So maybe the agent needs to go back towards there. Looking at the map, the agent is at (27,12), and the stairs up are westsouthwest, which would be southwest of where they are.

Wait, the cursor position is (27,12). The stairs were previously mentioned as very near southsouthwest. Maybe the agent needs to go southwest again? But the last few moves tried southwest and hit walls. Hmm.

Wait, in previous steps, when the agent moved southwest from (24,12) back to (23,13), maybe that's not the way. Alternatively, maybe the stairs are in a different direction. Let's check the language observations again.

The current language observation says stairs up near westsouthwest. So from the current position (27,12), westsouthwest would be southwest. But moving southwest from here resulted in a wall earlier. Maybe need to check the map layout again.

Looking at the map, the agent is at @ position (probably (27,12)), and the map shows |....@##. So the agent is in a corridor with walls further east. The stairs up are westsouthwest, which would be southwest from the agent's current position. But moving southwest there is a wall. So maybe the agent needs to explore other directions first.

Alternatively, perhaps the agent should try moving north or east again. Let's see. The vertical wall is near west, so moving east might be possible. Wait, the language observation says vertical wall near west, so east might be open. The dark area is very near east, but maybe that's a room or another part of the map. The agent needs to navigate through the dark areas.

Another idea: the agent has a sword and armor, so maybe combat isn't a problem yet. But the priority is to find the stairs down. Since the stairs up are near westsouthwest, perhaps the agent should head in that direction, but first check if there's a way around the walls.

Wait, the agent was at (25,11) earlier, and then moved around. Maybe the stairs down are actually in a different location. Alternatively, the agent might need to backtrack to a previous position where movement was possible.

Alternatively, the agent could try moving northwest or northeast to see if there's an opening. Let's check the language observations again. The vertical wall is adjacent east, so moving east might hit a wall. But the dark area is very near east, so perhaps moving east into the dark area could lead somewhere.

Wait, the current language observation says dark area very near east. So maybe moving east a couple of steps into the dark area could reveal a path. Let me try that. If the agent moves east from (27,12) to (28,12), but earlier moving east resulted in a wall. Hmm.

Wait, in the previous step, moving east from (27,12) to (28,12) was allowed, and the map showed |....@##, which suggests that east might be a corridor. But then moving further east might hit a wall. The agent needs to explore cautiously.

Alternatively, moving north from (27,12). The horizontal wall is adjacent southeast, south, and southwest. So moving north might be possible. Let me check. The language observation says horizontal wall near north. So moving north might hit a wall. Hmm.

Wait, the language observation says ""horizontal wall very near north and south"". So moving north from (27,12) would be into that wall. So can't go north. What about southwest again? But that's a wall. So maybe the agent is stuck in a loop here.

Alternatively, the agent needs to try different directions. Maybe move west to get back to a position where movement was possible. From (27,12) moving west to (26,12). But what's there? The map shows |....@##, so west of (27,12) is the @, and moving west would be into the ... part. Maybe that's a valid move.

Wait, the agent's current position is (27,12), and the map shows the third row (from top) as |....@##. So the agent's @ is at position (27,12), and moving west would take them to (26,12), which is a '.', which is a floor. So that's a valid move. Maybe the agent should move west to (26,12) and then proceed from there.

Once at (26,12), the agent can check other directions. The stairs up are near westsouthwest, which from (26,12) would be southwest to (25,13). But earlier moving southwest from (24,12) to (23,13) hit a wall. Need to see if there's another path.

Alternatively, from (26,12), moving southwest to (25,13) might be possible. Let's check the language observation again. At (26,12), the vertical wall is near west, so moving west from there would hit the wall. Moving south from (26,12) would be into the horizontal wall adjacent southeast, south, and southwest. So moving south would hit a wall. Moving east from (26,12) would be into the ##, which might be walls. Hmm.

Alternatively, moving north from (26,12). The horizontal wall is adjacent north, so that's a wall. So the only possible move from (26,12) might be southwest or west, but west is a wall. So southwest to (25,13), but that's a wall. Hmm. This is getting confusing.

Wait, maybe the agent needs to go back to a previous position where there were more options. For example, when the agent was at (24,12), they could move southwest or southeast. Maybe exploring those directions again would help.

Alternatively, the agent could try moving northeast from (27,12) to (28,13). But the language observation says vertical wall adjacent east, so moving northeast might hit a wall. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to pick a different strategy. Since the stairs up are near westsouthwest, perhaps the stairs down are in the opposite direction, which would be eastnortheast. But that's a guess. Alternatively, the agent should try to explore all directions systematically.

Another thought: the agent has a sword and armor, so maybe they can attack walls if they're destructible, but I don't think that's possible in MiniHack without specific commands. The agent needs to find open paths.

Given the current position and the walls around, the best possible action might be to move west to (26,12) and then check other directions from there. Let's try that.

Let's see. The goal is to explore the level and reach the stairs down. I need to parse the current situation.

First, looking at the observations. The agent is at position (26, 12). The stairs up are very near westsouthwest. Wait, but the stairs down are the target, right? Wait, in the initial problem statement, the goal is to reach the stairs down. So maybe the stairs up here are just part of the environment. The agent needs to find the stairs down, which might be in another part of the level.

Looking at the map, the current view shows walls and dark areas. The cursor is on '@' which is the agent's position. The map shows some structure. From previous steps, the agent has been moving around, hitting walls, exploring different directions.

The language observation mentions vertical walls near west, horizontal walls in the southwest and northwest. Stairs up are near westsouthwest. But where are the stairs down? Not mentioned here. So perhaps the agent needs to explore further, move in directions that aren't blocked by walls.

The inventory shows the agent has a long sword, lance, ring mail, etc. But maybe exploration is more critical right now. The agent should avoid moving into walls, so check the possible directions.

Previous attempts: moving south twice resulted in hitting a wall. Moving northeast, then southeast, then north, etc. The agent seems to be going in circles sometimes. The tip says to not repeat the same action if nothing changes. So need to vary movements.

Looking at the current position, the agent is at (26,12). The stairs up are westsouthwest, so maybe moving southwest could lead towards there, but the agent hit a wall earlier when trying southwest. Alternatively, check other directions.

The map shows |...@###| on the third line, which might indicate that to the east of the agent, there are walls. So moving east might be a wall. To the west, vertical wall is near, so moving west might also hit a wall. North and south: the horizontal walls are very near north and south, so those directions might be blocked.

Wait, the language observation says horizontal wall very near north and south. So moving north or south from current position would hit a wall. So those directions are blocked. The vertical wall is near west, so moving west would hit a wall. The agent is possibly in a corridor or a room with walls on north, south, west. The east direction has some structure (the ###), which might be walls or open areas.

So possible valid moves are east or maybe diagonal directions that aren't directly against the walls. But the agent tried east before and the map shows ...@###, meaning that moving east from (26,12) would be into the ###, which could be walls. Let's check the previous map updates. When the agent moved east to (27,12), the map showed |....@##|, indicating more walls. So east might be blocked.

What about other diagonal directions? The agent could try northeast or southeast, but earlier attempts in those directions either hit walls or didn't change the surroundings. Alternatively, maybe moving northwest? But the vertical wall is adjacent north and south, so northwest might be a wall.

Wait, the current language observation says vertical wall adjacent north and south. So moving north or south from here would be against the wall. The vertical wall near west, so moving west is a wall. The horizontal walls very near north and south. So the agent is in a position where north, south, west are walls. East has some structure but possibly walls.

In that case, the agent might need to backtrack. Previously, the agent was at (24,12) with stairs up adjacent south. Then moved south twice into a wall, then back north. Maybe the agent should try to explore other directions from the initial position.

But the agent is now at (26,12). Since movement options are limited, perhaps the best move is to try a different diagonal direction that wasn't tried before. For example, moving northeast again, but maybe the agent can find a passage there.

Alternatively, check the stairs up. The stairs up are near westsouthwest, which is southwest of the agent's current position. But the agent needs to find the stairs down. Maybe the stairs down are elsewhere in the level. Since the agent hasn't found them yet, continuing to explore different directions is necessary.

Wait, the initial problem statement says the goal is to reach the stairs down. The stairs up are just part of the environment. So the agent needs to look for other stairs. Maybe the map has multiple stairs, but the agent needs to find the down one.

Given the current map, the agent is surrounded by walls on three sides. The only possible moves might be east, but that leads to walls. Alternatively, the agent could try moving in a diagonal that's not directly against the walls. For example, moving northeast or southeast, but those might hit walls.

Alternatively, the agent could try to move in a direction that was previously possible. For instance, when the agent was at (24,12), moving southwest took them somewhere. Now, perhaps moving back in that direction? But the agent is at (26,12). Moving southwest would take them to (25,11), which was previously explored. Let me check the history.

Earlier, when the agent was at (25,11), they moved southeast, then north, etc. So maybe exploring other directions from (26,12). Let's see. The agent could try moving east again, but the map shows ###, which might be walls. Alternatively, moving northwest, but that's adjacent to a vertical wall.

Alternatively, the agent could try to pick a different direction, like southwest again, but the observation says it's a wall. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the agent should pick up an item, but the inventory is already full. The goal is to explore and reach the stairs down, not collect items.

Given the constraints, perhaps the best move is to try moving southwest again, even though it's a wall, but maybe there's a change. Or check if there's a different path.

Wait, the agent's current position is (26,12). The stairs up are westsouthwest, which would be southwest from (26,12) to (25,11), but that was a previous position. Maybe the stairs down are in another part of the level. Since the agent hasn't found them yet, perhaps moving in a different direction entirely.

Wait, the map shows a horizontal wall very near north and south. So moving north or south is impossible. The vertical wall near west, so moving west is a wall. The east direction has ###, which might be a continuation of walls. So the agent is stuck in a corner with walls on three sides. In that case, perhaps the agent needs to backtrack to a previous location where there were more options.

For example, when the agent was at (24,12), they could move south, north, west, or southwest. Now, they are at (26,12), which is further east but surrounded. So backtracking west to (24,12) might be necessary. How to get there? From (26,12), moving west four times would get to (22,12), but there might be walls along the way. Alternatively, check if moving northwest is possible.

Wait, the vertical wall is adjacent north and south, so moving northwest would be against the vertical wall. Similarly, moving northeast would hit the horizontal wall. So the only possible move is west, but moving west from (26,12) to (25,12) was possible before, but then further west might hit a wall.

Looking back at the map when the agent was at (25,12), the map showed |...@#|, indicating a wall to the east. So moving west from (25,12) would be into open space? Or another wall. This is getting a bit confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the agent should try to move in a diagonal direction that isn't directly against a wall. For example, moving northwest from (26,12) would go to (25,11), which was previously explored and had a corner. But that might be a wall.

Alternatively, the agent could try to move east again, but the map shows ###, which could be a continuation of walls. Maybe the agent needs to explore further east, but that might not be possible.

Wait, in the current map, the third line is |...@###|, which at position (26,12) is the '@' in the fourth character. So to the east of the agent, there are '###', which likely represent walls. So moving east would hit a wall. Moving northeast would be into the '##', which is also a wall.

Given all this, the agent is possibly stuck in a dead end. The only possible movement is west, but that might lead to a wall or a previously visited area. Since the agent needs to explore, perhaps moving west again to see if there's a change. But in previous steps, moving west from (26,12) to (25,12) was possible, and then further west might hit a wall.

Alternatively, the agent could try to move in a different diagonal, like southwest, but that's a wall. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the agent should pick a different path initially. When the agent was at (24,12), they moved southwest to (23,11), then east, etc. Maybe exploring other directions from there could lead to the stairs down.

But given the current position, the agent has limited options. The only possible move that isn't a wall is west, but that might not lead anywhere new. Alternatively, the agent could try to move in a direction that was previously possible but not yet exhausted.

Alternatively, perhaps the agent should look for the stairs down in another part of the level. Since the current area is a dead end, moving back to a previous location with more exploration options is necessary.

Given that, maybe the best action is to move west again to (25,12) and see if there's a different path from there. Even though the agent has been there before, maybe there's something new observed now.

So, the chosen action would be west.

I need to figure out how to get the agent to the stairs down. Let's look at the current situation.

The agent is at position (25, 12). The map shows some walls and dark areas. The stairs up are adjacent to the southwest corner. Wait, but the goal is to reach the stairs down, not up. Hmm, maybe there's a typo in the observation? Or maybe the stairs down are in another part of the level. But in the current observations, the only stairs mentioned are stairs up. So perhaps the agent needs to explore more to find the stairs down.

Looking at the language observation, there's a vertical wall near the west, and horizontal walls to the north, south, southwest, and northwest. The dark area is near the east, and vertical walls adjacent to northeast and southeast. The stairs up are adjacent to southwest. So the agent is next to the stairs up, but we need to get to the stairs down. 

Since the agent is on the first level (Dlvl:1), maybe there's another staircase somewhere else. The problem is that the agent is getting stuck trying to move around walls. The previous actions led the agent to various positions, but now they're at (25,12) with stairs up to the southwest. 

The agent needs to explore further. The horizontal walls suggest there might be passages in other directions. Let's check the possible moves. To the west is a vertical wall, so the agent can't go west again. To the east, there's a dark area, which might be an open path. North and south have horizontal walls, so those directions are blocked. Southeast and northeast have vertical walls. Southwest is the stairs up, but we need down. 

Wait, the message mentions ""dark area near east."" So maybe moving east is possible. The agent tried moving east before and encountered walls, but perhaps there's a corridor there. Alternatively, maybe the agent should check other directions. Let me check the map again. The map shows at (25,12) the agent is at a position with ..@.###, meaning to the east there's a #, which is a wall. So moving east directly is a wall. But the dark area is very near east, so maybe adjacent tiles are accessible. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent should move northeast or southeast to find a path. But according to the language observations, vertical walls are near northeast and southeast. Hmm. Maybe the agent needs to backtrack. The previous steps were moving south, then north, then northeast, southeast, etc. Now the agent is back near the start but further east. 

Another approach: since the agent can't proceed east directly, maybe moving southwest to the stairs up and then explore from there. But the goal is stairs down, not up. Unless the stairs up are a way to another level, but the problem states to reach the stairs down. So perhaps the agent needs to proceed in a different direction. 

Wait, the initial position was (24,13). Then moved south, hit a wall, went north, etc. Now at (25,12). Maybe moving north again? But the language observation says horizontal wall near north. So north is blocked. What about southwest? The stairs up are there, but that's the opposite direction of the goal. 

Alternatively, the agent could try to find a different corridor. Let me think. The map has some # symbols which are walls. The agent is at ..@.###, meaning to the east of the agent, there's a ###, so a wall three tiles east. But the dark area is near east, so maybe the agent can go around the corner. For example, moving southeast might lead to a corridor. 

Looking at the language observation: vertical wall adjacent southeast. So moving southeast directly is a wall. But maybe moving south first? But the horizontal wall is adjacent south. Hmm. 

Wait, the stairs up are adjacent southwest. Maybe moving southwest to the stairs and then... but that's the only staircase detected so far. Since the goal is stairs down, perhaps the agent needs to explore further in other directions. Since the agent can't go north, east (blocked by wall), west (wall), northeast (wall), southeast (wall), maybe the remaining directions are south and southwest. But south has a horizontal wall. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent should pick up items. The inventory has a +1 long sword, ring mail, etc. But picking up items isn't necessary for reaching the stairs. The priority is exploration. 

Wait, the agent's cursor is at (25,12). The map shows the agent's position with @, and around there are walls and dark areas. The dark areas might be unexplored parts of the map. The agent could move in a direction that leads away from the walls. For example, moving northeast or northwest, but according to the language observations, vertical walls are near northeast and northwest. 

Alternatively, the agent could try moving southwest to the stairs up, then perhaps that leads to another part of the level with the stairs down. But in MiniHack, sometimes stairs down are in different locations. Since the agent is on Dlvl:1, maybe going up first and then down, but the problem states to reach the stairs down, not up. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent should move east again but in a different direction. Wait, the agent was at (27,12) east, but there was a vertical wall. Maybe moving northeast from there? Let me check the previous steps. 

Alternatively, perhaps the agent has looped and needs to try a different path. The tip says to avoid repeating the same action if nothing changes. The agent has been moving around, hitting walls, so maybe the best move now is to try moving east again, but in a different direction. Wait, the agent is at (25,12). To the east is a wall, but maybe moving northeast or southeast could find a passage. 

Looking at the language observation: vertical walls adjacent northeast and southeast. So those directions are blocked. The horizontal walls are near north and south. So the only possible moves are west (which is a vertical wall), or southwest (stairs up). But the agent needs to reach stairs down. 

Wait, maybe the agent hasn't found the stairs down yet. The current observations only mention stairs up. So the agent must explore further to find the stairs down. Since all other moves are blocked except southwest (stairs up) and west (wall), perhaps the agent needs to go back the way it came. For example, moving north from (25,12) is blocked by a horizontal wall. Moving northeast is a wall. So the only option is to move southwest to the stairs up, but that's not helpful. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent made a mistake in previous movements and needs to retrace steps. For example, moving west from (25,12) to (24,12), then trying different directions there. Let's see: at (24,12), the agent could move south, north, east, or west. 

But according to the previous map, at (24,12), the agent had a |.<.| in the map, which might indicate a corridor. Maybe moving south from there could lead to a new area. 

Alternatively, perhaps the agent should try to pick a direction that wasn't explored yet. For example, moving northwest from (25,12). But the language observation says vertical wall adjacent northwest. 

Hmm. This is tricky. The agent is stuck in a corridor with walls on most sides and only stairs up available. Since the goal is stairs down, maybe the agent needs to go up to another level and then come back down, but that's not possible unless stairs down are on another level. However, the problem states to reach the stairs down on the current level or another level? The initial problem says ""reach the stairs down"" without specifying the level, so the agent might need to go down from another level. But if the agent is on Dlvl:1 and can't find stairs down, maybe it needs to go up first to find them. 

But the problem says ""explore the level and reach the stairs down"". So perhaps the stairs down are on the same level. But in the current observations, only stairs up are present. That's confusing. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent is in a loop and hasn't discovered the stairs down yet. The agent should continue exploring in other directions. But given the current map layout, there might not be other paths. 

Wait, the agent's current position is (25,12). The map shows ..@.###, meaning east of the agent is a wall. Maybe moving east twice would hit a wall, but perhaps there's a corridor beyond. But according to the language observation, dark area is very near east, which might mean it's blocked. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent should try to move diagonally. For example, southeast or southwest diagonally. But in MiniHack, diagonal movement is allowed in some cases, but the actions listed don't include diagonal moves. The available actions are the eight compass directions and their diagonals. Wait, the actions listed are north, east, south, west, and the eight diagonals (northeast, southeast, etc.). So the agent can move in any of those 9 directions. 

So from (25,12), possible diagonal moves could be southeast, southwest, northeast, northwest, etc. Let's check. Moving southeast from (25,12) would go to (26,13). But the language observation says vertical wall adjacent southeast, so that's a wall. Moving southwest to (24,13), which was the starting position. There, the agent could move south again, but that hit a wall before. 

Alternatively, moving northeast from (25,12) to (26,11). The language observation says vertical wall adjacent northeast, so that's a wall. Moving northwest to (24,11), but the vertical wall is adjacent northwest. 

Hmm. It seems like all diagonal moves are blocked. The only possible move is southwest to the stairs up. But the agent needs stairs down. 

Wait, maybe the agent should use the stairs up to go to another level and then look for stairs down there. But the problem states to reach the stairs down, which could be on any level. However, the agent's goal is to reach them, regardless of the level. So perhaps the correct approach is to go up first, then explore other levels for the stairs down. 

In that case, moving southwest to the stairs up (at (24,13)) and taking the stairs up. Then, on the next level, explore to find the stairs down. But the problem says ""reach the stairs down"", so maybe the agent is allowed to go up and then down. 

But the current observations don't show stairs down, so the agent needs to proceed accordingly. However, based on the current map and observations, the only staircase mentioned is stairs up. 

Given that, the best move might be to move southwest to the stairs up and take them, then look for stairs down on the next level. But since the agent hasn't explored beyond Dlvl:1 yet, this could be a viable path. 

Alternatively, if the agent is supposed to stay on Dlvl:1, then it needs to find the stairs down there. But based on the current map, it's not visible. 

Given the information available, the safest bet is to move towards the stairs up (southwest) and see what's there, possibly leading to a new level where stairs down are present. 

So the chosen action would be to move southwest to the stairs up.

Let's see where I am. I'm trying to reach the stairs down in this level. Looking at the map, I remember that the stairs up were mentioned before, but now I might need to find the stairs down. The current observation doesn't show any stairs down, but maybe I missed it.

Looking at the language observation, there's a horizontal wall near north, vertical walls around, and horizontal walls in the southeast, south, and southwest. The cursor is at (24,13). Previously, when I was at (24,12), there was a stair up to the south. So maybe stairs down are somewhere else.

I need to explore more. Since I hit a wall when trying north initially, perhaps I should check other directions. Wait, the map shows some areas as .....###, which might be explored or have items. Maybe moving east or west could reveal something.

But the tip says not to repeat the same action if nothing changes. I've been moving around trying different directions. Let me check the last moves. Previously, I moved north, then northeast, southeast, north again (hit a wall), east, southwest, etc. The stairs up were at (24,12) south. But the goal is stairs down.

In MiniHack, sometimes the stairs down are in a different location. I should keep exploring. Maybe moving south from the current position (24,13) could lead somewhere. Let me try south again.

Let's take a look at the current situation. The agent is at position (24,13) and has tried moving south into a wall. The map shows a horizontal wall adjacent to the south and southwest. The stairs down must be somewhere, but they haven't been found yet.

Previously, the agent explored various directions but kept hitting walls. The inventory shows some good gear, like the +1 long sword and ring mail, which is helpful but doesn't directly help in finding the stairs. The key here is to navigate around the walls and explore open areas.

Looking at the language observations, there's a horizontal wall near the north and vertical walls on the northeast, east, west, and northwest. The horizontal walls are adjacent to the south, southeast, and southwest. So, moving south into a wall isn't helpful. Maybe moving west or east could lead somewhere, but those areas have vertical walls. 

The stairs up were mentioned earlier at ""westsouthwest"" but now the stairs down are the target. Since the agent is at (24,13) and the horizontal walls are south, maybe moving west or southwest could open up a path. But the vertical walls are blocking those directions. Alternatively, moving north might avoid the walls, but the horizontal wall is near the north. 

Wait, the initial observation when the agent was at (24,12) had stairs up adjacent south. Now, after moving south to (24,13), the walls are more present. Maybe going back north to (24,12) and then trying different directions. Let's check the history. The agent moved north initially, then northeast, southeast, etc. Perhaps trying a different pattern now. 

Since moving south is a wall, moving west or southwest is also blocked by vertical walls. How about moving northeast? From (24,13), northeast would take the agent to (25,12). Let me see the map. At (25,12), there's a '#' which might be a wall or a feature. The agent was there before, but the map shows ...@### which could mean some structure. 

Alternatively, moving northwest to (23,13) might be possible if there's no wall. The vertical wall is very near northwest, but maybe there's a path. The language observation mentions vertical walls near west and northwest, but adjacent southwest and northwest. So moving northwest from (24,13) to (23,13) might hit a wall. 

Another idea: the agent has a shield and helmet, but maybe using other actions like picking up items or attacking isn't necessary here. The main goal is to explore and find the stairs down. Since the stairs up were in the southwest corner before, perhaps moving towards the southwest again, but avoiding the walls. 

Wait, the current position is (24,13) with horizontal walls to the south. Maybe moving west to (23,13) and then checking south? Or moving east to (25,13) where there might be a path. Let me think about the map layout. The map shows some '#' symbols which could be walls or other features. The agent needs to navigate around these. 

Alternatively, since the agent was at (24,12) earlier with stairs up south, maybe going back north to (24,12) and then moving southwest. From (24,12), southwest would be (23,11), which might be a valid move if there's no wall. 

But the agent's previous attempt to go southwest from (27,12) hit a wall. Hmm. Maybe trying a different diagonal direction. The agent could move northwest from (24,13) to (23,12). Check if that's possible. According to the language observation, vertical walls are very near northwest, so maybe that's a wall. 

Alternatively, moving east to (25,13). The map shows ....### at that row, so maybe moving east is possible. Let's check the vertical walls. The vertical wall is near west, but east might be open. 

Wait, the language observation says vertical walls are very near northeast, east, west, and northwest. So moving east from (24,13) to (25,13) is against the east vertical wall. That's a problem. 

So possible moves: north to (24,14), but the horizontal wall is adjacent south, which might be the same level. Or moving south is a wall. Maybe trying to find a corridor. 

Alternatively, the agent could move northeast to (25,12), which was previously visited but had a wall. Or southwest to (23,12), which might be a wall based on vertical walls. 

Hmm. This is tricky. The agent needs to explore without hitting walls. Let's think about the initial position. The stairs up were in the south, so maybe the stairs down are in the opposite direction, like north or a different corner. 

Another approach: since the agent is at (24,13) and the horizontal walls are to the south, maybe moving north to (24,14) could reveal a new area. But the language observation mentions horizontal walls near north, so perhaps that's also a wall. 

Alternatively, check the cursor position and map again. The cursor is at (24,13), and the map row for y=13 has |.@.|, indicating the agent is in the middle of that row. The horizontal walls adjacent to the south would be in y=14. So moving south into y=14 would hit a wall. 

Wait, the map might be structured with y increasing downward. So the agent is at y=13, and moving south would go to y=14, which has a horizontal wall. That's confirmed by the observation. 

So available moves: north, east, west, northwest, northeast, etc., but need to avoid walls. From (24,13), east is blocked by vertical wall, west is vertical wall near west. Northeast is (25,12), which had a wall before. Southwest is (23,12), which might be a wall. 

Wait, the language observation says vertical walls are very near northeast, east, west, and northwest. So moving northeast from (24,13) to (25,12) is against the northeast vertical wall. Similarly, moving northwest to (23,12) is against the northwest vertical wall. 

So the only possible directions without immediate walls might be north or south, but south is a wall. North to (24,14) but horizontal wall is adjacent south, which could mean that moving north is possible if there's no wall there. Wait, the horizontal wall is very near south, which is at y=14. So moving north to y=14 would be into the horizontal wall. 

This is confusing. Maybe the agent needs to backtrack. The previous position was (24,12) with stairs up south. Going back north to (24,12) and then trying a different direction. From (24,12), possible moves: southwest, which was tried before but hit a wall. Maybe west or east? 

At (24,12), vertical walls are near west. So moving west is blocked. Moving east to (25,12) had a wall. Moving northeast to (25,11), which was previously observed. 

Alternatively, the agent could try moving in a different pattern, like zig-zagging. From (24,13), move north to (24,14), but that's a wall. So perhaps move west to (23,13), which might be possible if there's no vertical wall there. 

Wait, the vertical walls are very near west and northwest. So moving west from (24,13) to (23,13) would still be near the vertical wall. Maybe it's a wall. 

This is challenging. The agent might need to explore other directions that weren't tried yet. For example, moving southeast from (24,13) to (25,14). But the language observation mentions dark areas very near southeast, which might be a wall or an open area. 

Alternatively, the agent could use the available moves to trace the perimeter of the walls. Since the vertical walls are on the east, west, and northwest, maybe moving along the south edge where the horizontal walls are. 

Wait, the horizontal walls are adjacent to the south, southeast, and southwest. So moving south from (24,13) is a wall, but moving southeast to (25,14) might be possible if there's no wall there. 

But the language observation says dark area very near southeast, which could indicate an open area or a wall. It's ambiguous. 

Perhaps the best move is to try moving southwest again, even though it hit a wall before, in case the observation was incorrect. Or try moving west to (23,13) and see. 

Alternatively, since the agent has a shield and weapon, maybe attacking a monster, but there's no indication of any enemies yet. 

Given the lack of clear paths, the agent should backtrack to a previous position where movement was possible. For example, going back to (24,12) and then trying a different direction, like northeast. 

From (24,12), moving northeast to (25,11) was done before, but resulted in a wall. However, maybe there's a different path there now. 

Alternatively, moving northwest from (24,12) to (23,11), which was previously observed as a wall. 

This is quite stuck. Maybe the agent needs to try moving in a different diagonal direction, like southwest from (24,12) to (23,11), but that's a wall. 

Alternatively, the agent could try moving east from (24,12) to (25,12), which had a wall. 

Hmm. Perhaps the agent needs to explore the northern areas. From (24,13), moving north to (24,14) is blocked by a horizontal wall. So that's not an option. 

Wait, the language observation mentions horizontal wall very near north and southwest and northwest. So moving north from (24,13) to (24,14) would be into the horizontal wall. 

Given all these walls, the agent might need to find a corridor that opens up. Since the previous steps involved moving around and hitting walls, maybe the only way is to move in a direction that wasn't blocked yet. 

Wait, the initial position was (24,12) with stairs up south. From there, moving southwest to (23,11) was a wall. Moving west to (23,12) was a wall. Maybe moving north from (24,12) to (24,11) is possible. Let me check the map. 

At (24,11), the map row shows |...|, which might be open. So moving north from (24,12) to (24,11) could be possible. 

Yes, that might work. The agent was at (24,12) previously, and moving north to (24,11) where the map is |...|, indicating open space. That could be a valid move. 

So the plan is to backtrack to (24,12) and then move north to explore the upper part of the map.

Let's see. The goal is to reach the stairs down. Looking at the current observation, the cursor is at (24, 12). The stairs up are adjacent to the south. In the previous steps, the agent tried various directions but hit walls a lot. The map shows some walls and dark areas. The stairs down would be the destination, but here the stairs up are adjacent south, which might be a different staircase. Maybe need to confirm where the actual stairs down are.

The language observation mentions ""stairs up adjacent south"", so maybe the stairs down are somewhere else. Since the agent's goal is stairs down, they need to explore more. The agent has an inventory with some items, but probably not needed yet. The agent should move towards unexplored areas. The map has horizontal walls north and south, vertical walls west, and some corners. The dark areas might be unknown parts of the map.

Looking at the cursor position and the map, moving south would reach the stairs up, but that's not the goal. Need to check other directions. The northeast room corner is near northeast, so maybe moving northeast could lead somewhere. Alternatively, since there's a horizontal wall adjacent south and southwest, moving west might hit a wall. The vertical wall very near west suggests moving west is a wall. So possible directions are north, east, southeast, or southwest? Wait, the horizontal wall is near north and south, so maybe moving north or south is a wall. Wait, the horizontal wall very near north and south at (24,12) would mean that moving north or south from there is into a wall. So the agent is in a spot where north and south are walls. The vertical wall very near west means west is a wall. So possible moves are east, southeast, or southwest.

But in the map, the agent's position is |.@..###|, so maybe the # symbols are walls. The agent needs to find a path that's not a wall. The dark area very near southeast suggests that moving southeast might reveal a new area. Alternatively, moving east could lead to an open space. But the vertical wall very near east? Wait, the language observation says vertical wall very near northeast, east, west, and northwest. So east is a vertical wall. So moving east is a wall. So the only possible directions are southeast or southwest. But moving south is a wall (horizontal wall adjacent south). Wait, the agent is at (24,12), and the horizontal wall is very near north and south. So moving north or south from here would hit a wall.

So the agent can't move north or south. The vertical walls are west and east. So the possible moves are southeast or southwest. Let's check the map again. The agent's position is |.@..###|, which might mean that to the east are walls. So moving southeast or southwest. Let's try moving southeast. But the dark area very near southeast might be a better path. Alternatively, moving southwest towards the southwest corner. Let me check the previous steps. Earlier, moving southwest resulted in hitting a wall, but maybe there's a way through. Alternatively, since the stairs down are the goal, maybe the agent needs to go around the walls to find them. The agent has been moving around trying different directions but hitting walls. Maybe need to backtrack. Previously, the agent moved west to (25,12), then southwest to (24,13), then north back to (24,12). Perhaps moving south from (24,12) is a wall, so need to go east or west, but those are walls. So the only options are southeast or southwest. Let's pick southeast and see if that leads to a new area.

Let's see. The goal is to reach the stairs down. Looking at the latest observation, the stairs up are adjacent to the west, but the current position is (25,13) and the cursor shows the agent as @. The stairs up are west, but maybe they want to go down? The problem says to reach the stairs down. So maybe the stairs down are elsewhere.

From the language observation, there's a northwest room corner and a horizontal wall to the south and southwest. The vertical wall is near the west. The agent is at (25,13). The map shows some walls and maybe a room. The stairs up are west, but the target is stairs down.

Wait, the initial info said to reach the stairs down. So perhaps the stairs down are located somewhere else. The agent needs to explore the map to find them. The previous movements led the agent to various walls, so maybe they need to find a corridor leading to another room or the stairs.

Looking at the current map, the agent is in a part that has walls to the north, west, east, and possibly south. The southeast corner is adjacent. The horizontal wall is to the south and southwest. So maybe moving south could lead to a passage? Or perhaps moving northeast?

Wait, the language observation mentions a horizontal wall adjacent south and southwest. The agent is at (25,13). If moving south, would that hit the wall? The current position's south is a horizontal wall. So moving south is a wall. How about moving east? The vertical wall is near west, but the vertical wall adjacent east? Wait, the language observation says vertical wall adjacent east. So moving east would be a wall. 

The northeast room corner is near northeast. Maybe moving northeast could lead out of the current room. Let me check the coordinates. If the agent is at (25,13) and moves northeast, that would be (26,14). But is that passable? The map shows ...@|... Maybe there's a passage there. Alternatively, moving northwest to (24,12), but the stairs up are there. But the goal is stairs down, so maybe not.

Another approach: the agent has a +1 long sword and other gear. Maybe it's not necessary to fight anything yet. The priority is exploration. The agent has been moving around, hitting walls. Let's check the recent actions. The last move was southeast, which brought them to (25,13). Now, possible moves: north, south (wall), east (wall), west, northwest, northeast, etc.

Wait, the cursor is positioned at |.<@|, so the '@' is in the fourth position of the third row. The map might have a layout like:

-----
|...|
|....### 
|.<@|
-----

So moving north from (25,13) would be into the third row, which is |....###|, so probably a wall. Moving south is into the horizontal wall. East is into the vertical wall. West would take them to (24,13). Let's check the language observation: vertical wall adjacent east. So moving east is a wall. Moving west: vertical wall near west, but maybe there's a passage west of (25,13). The language observation says vertical wall very near west, but the agent is at x=25, so west would be x=24. Maybe that's a corridor.

Alternatively, moving northwest to (24,12). The stairs up are adjacent west, which is at (24,12). But again, the goal is stairs down. Maybe the stairs down are in another part of the map. The agent needs to explore more.

Looking at the inventory, the agent has some food, but no key or amulet. Maybe need to pick up items, but the priority is reaching the stairs down. Perhaps moving in a direction that leads away from the walls. The agent was previously moving southeast, then west, southwest, etc., hitting walls. Maybe a different approach is needed.

Wait, the language observation now mentions a horizontal wall adjacent south and southwest. So from (25,13), moving south would hit a horizontal wall. Moving southwest to (24,12), which is where the stairs up are. But the goal is stairs down. Maybe the stairs down are in another part of the dungeon. The agent needs to explore further.

Alternatively, maybe moving northeast. From (25,13) to (26,14). The map's fourth row (after the dashes) is |.<.|, which at x=26 would be the '.' character. So moving northeast might lead into a passage. Let me think: the agent's current position is (25,13), and moving northeast would decrease x by 1 and increase y by 1, so (24,14)? Wait, coordinates can be confusing. In text-based games, often y increases downward. So moving north would decrease y, south increases y. So (25,13) moving northeast would be (24,14). Let's check the map layout.

The map shows:

So row 0 is the top, row 3 is the bottom. The agent is in row 2 (since the third row is |.<@|). Moving northeast from (25,13) would take them to row 3, column 24 (assuming x decreases left, y increases down). The fourth row (after the dashes) is |.<.|, so column 24 would be the '.' in that row. That seems passable. So moving northeast could be a good option to proceed.

Alternatively, moving west to (24,13). The language observation says vertical wall near west, but maybe there's a door or a passage there. But the vertical wall adjacent east suggests that moving east from (25,13) is a wall. Moving west might be into a corridor.

Another possibility: the agent has a sword and shield, so combat isn't the priority. The main goal is exploration. Let's try moving northeast to (24,14) to see if there's a path. Alternatively, moving northwest to (24,12) where the stairs up are, but that's the opposite direction of the goal.

Considering the previous movements and the walls, moving northeast seems like a viable option to explore further. Let's choose northeast.

I need to figure out the next best move for the knight in MiniHack. The goal is to explore the level and reach the stairs down. Let me look at the current situation.

First, the map shows the knight's position at (26,12). The stairs up are at westsouthwest, which based on previous observations seems to be near (25,11) or similar. But there's a giant rat adjacent to the east. The message says ""The giant rat bites!"" and the knight's HP dropped from 16 to 14. So the rat is a threat and needs to be dealt with first to avoid more damage.

Looking at the language observations: dark areas are near east, vertical walls near west, and the rat is adjacent east. The stairs up are very near westsouthwest. The knight has a +1 long sword and a +1 lance, along with some armor and food. Since the rat is next to the knight, attacking it makes sense to eliminate the threat.

Possible actions: move away from the rat (west, northwest, southwest) or attack it. But movement could lead into other dangers or away from the stairs. Attacking the rat directly would reduce the risk of further bites. The knight is wielding a long sword, which is good for melee attacks. So using attack-east (since the rat is east) seems viable. Alternatively, the lance can be used if wielded, but the knight is currently using the sword. 

Wait, the inventory shows the long sword is in hand, so attacking east with the sword is possible. Alternatively, moving west to create distance and then proceed towards the stairs. But moving west might be safer if the rat is aggressive. Let's check the surroundings again. The vertical wall is near west, so moving west from (26,12) would hit a wall. So the knight can't move west directly. Possible directions: north, south, east (towards the rat), northeast, northwest, southeast, southwest. 

Since the rat is adjacent east, attacking it with 'attack-east' would be the direct approach. This way, the knight can eliminate the rat, gain some XP, and then proceed exploring. Alternatively, moving southwest or south might allow avoiding the rat and heading towards the stairs, but the stairs are to the westsouthwest, which is behind the knight's current position. The knight is at (26,12), and the stairs are westsouthwest, so moving southwest or west would get closer. But moving west is blocked by a wall. 

So the options are: attack the rat (east), move south to check if there's a path, or move southwest. Let's consider attack-east. Attacking the rat could kill it, which is a priority. The knight has good DX (8), so the attack might be effective. Alternatively, moving south to see if there's a way around or a corridor leading down. 

Looking at the map, the current position has a # symbol to the east of the knight, which is the rat. The map shows |...@r##|, so the rat is in the same row, next to the knight. The stairs are further westsouthwest. 

Another thing to note: the knight has food (apples and carrots), so if the battle drags on, they can heal. But eliminating the rat quickly is better. 

So the best action is to attack the rat east. That way, the knight can eliminate the immediate threat and then proceed towards the stairs. The alternative is to move southwest, but that might not be as direct. Let's confirm the stairs' location. Previous observations mention stairs up very near westsouthwest. From (26,12), westsouthwest would be moving southwest twice? Let's see: (26,12) moving west to 25,12 (but there's a wall), so maybe southwest once to 25,13. Then southwest again to 24,14? Not sure. Alternatively, the stairs are at (25,11) based on previous steps. 

In any case, attacking the rat first is the priority. So the chosen action should be 'attack-east'.

The agent is trying to reach the stairs down. The problem is that the stairs are located westsouthwest, but there are walls and a giant rat blocking the path. In the observations, there's a giant rat adjacent to the east. The agent needs to fight it to move past.

Previously, the user tried ""attack-east"", but that isn't a valid action according to the allowed list. The possible actions are movement directions only. So, attacking isn't directly an option. The correct approach here is to move closer to the rat to attack it. Since the rat is to the east, moving east would put the agent next to it. But wait, when the agent tried moving east before, there was a wall. Now, the rat is adjacent east, so maybe the agent is not next to the rat yet. Let me check the cursor position. The agent is at (26, 12), and the rat is adjacent east. That means the rat is at (27, 12). The agent is currently at (26,12), so moving east would take them to (27,12), which is where the rat is. But earlier attempts to move east resulted in hitting a wall, but maybe that was when the rat wasn't there. Wait, the map shows a 'r' at (27,12) now. So moving east would allow the agent to attack the rat. But according to the allowed actions, there's no attack command. So the agent needs to get into position to attack. However, since attacking isn't a movement action, the only way is to move next to the rat and then use the attack command, but the available actions don't include attack. Hmm, this is a problem.

Wait, maybe the agent can use the 'wait' action or try to move around the rat. Alternatively, since the rat is adjacent, perhaps the agent can move east to reach it, but earlier that caused a wall. Maybe the map has changed. Let me look at the latest map. The map shows at position (27,12) a 'r' which is the rat. The agent is at (26,12). So moving east would take them to (27,12), which is the rat's location. But earlier when the agent moved east, it hit a wall. That suggests that maybe the rat isn't blocking the movement, but the actual terrain is a wall. Wait, there's a contradiction here. If the rat is adjacent east, then moving east should be possible unless there's a wall. But the language observation says ""dark area very near east"" and ""vertical wall near west"". So perhaps the rat is in a different position or the map is different. Maybe the agent needs to check the map again.

Looking at the current map, the agent's position is (26,12), and the map's third line is ""|...@r##"" which at position x=26 is the '@' (agent), then 'r' at x=27, then two '#'. So moving east from (26,12) would go to (27,12), which is the rat. So the agent can move east to attack. But previously, when the agent tried moving east, it said ""It's a wall."" That must have been in a different state. Maybe the map changed, or there was a misunderstanding. Now, with the rat present, moving east should be possible. However, the system might still report a wall if there's an inconsistency. Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to use a different approach. Since attacking isn't a movement action, perhaps the best way is to move around the rat to reach the stairs. The stairs are westsouthwest, which is towards the southwest direction. The agent is currently at (26,12). Moving southwest might lead towards the stairs. But the stairs are westsouthwest, so perhaps moving southwest twice or combining directions. Alternatively, check if there's a path through other directions. The agent has tried moving south, southwest, etc., but hit walls. Maybe the agent needs to go west again to get closer to the stairs. Let's think: the stairs are westsouthwest from the starting position. The agent was at (27,12) initially, then moved east, west, etc. Now at (26,12). To go westsouthwest from here, moving west would take to (25,12), then south to (25,13), then west again? But the language observation mentions a horizontal wall near north and vertical walls near west. Maybe the agent needs to find a corridor that leads southwest. Alternatively, since there's a giant rat blocking the east, the agent should prioritize defeating it to open up the path. But without an attack action, the agent has to rely on moving into position. So moving east to (27,12) where the rat is, then perhaps the next step would be to attack, but since that's not a valid action, the agent might need to wait or find another way. Alternatively, maybe the agent can use the ' kick ' action, but that's not listed. The allowed actions are only movement. Therefore, the agent must move around the rat. Since the rat is to the east, moving south or north might bypass it. The current position is (26,12). Moving south to (26,13) might be possible if there's no wall. Looking at the language observation, there's a horizontal wall very near southwest and northwest, which might be at y=13. So moving south to (26,13) could hit a wall. Alternatively, moving west to (25,12) and then south or southwest. The stairs are westsouthwest, so moving west twice and then south might get closer. The agent has already moved west to (25,12). From there, moving southwest to (24,13) could be a path. Let me check the map again. The latest map shows at (24,13) a '.' which is a corridor. So moving southwest from (25,12) to (24,13) is possible. That direction might lead towards the stairs. So the next action should be southwest to move towards the stairs, avoiding the rat. Alternatively, moving west again to (25,12) and then south. But the language observation says horizontal wall near north, so moving south from (25,12) might hit a wall. Therefore, moving southwest from (25,12) to (24,13) is a better option. The agent's current position after the last move was (26,12), so the next step could be west to (25,12), then southwest to (24,13). But first, the agent needs to decide the best path. Considering the stairs are westsouthwest, moving southwest seems appropriate. So the chosen action is southwest.

Let me try to figure out the best move here. The agent is a knight trying to reach the stairs down. From the current observation, the stairs up are near westsouthwest, but the goal is to reach the stairs down. So I need to make sure I'm moving towards that.

Looking at the map, the agent is at (25, 13). The stairs up are westsouthwest, which probably means southwest direction. But since we need stairs down, I might need to explore more. The language observation mentions a giant rat adjacent northeast. The rat is near northeast, so maybe that's a threat. The agent's current position is next to the rat. 

The message says ""It's solid stone"" when trying to move west before, so west is a wall. The vertical wall is near west, so moving west again isn't helpful. The stairs up are adjacent west, but we need down. 

The agent has a +1 long sword, which is good for fighting. The rat is adjacent northeast, so attacking it could be a priority to avoid being bitten again. But the previous attempt to attack-east resulted in an error because the action wasn't valid. Maybe the correct action is to attack the rat using the sword. 

Possible actions: move directions, attack, use items. Since the rat is nearby, attacking it makes sense. The correct attack command might be ""attack east"" since the rat is to the northeast of the agent's current position. Wait, the agent is at (25,13). If the rat is adjacent northeast, that would be (26,14). So to attack it, the direction would be east and north? Or maybe the game expects a direction like northeast. But looking at the previous error where ""attack-east"" wasn't valid, maybe the correct format is ""attack east"" without the hyphen. Alternatively, maybe ""attack northeast"". 

Alternatively, since the rat is adjacent, maybe the agent can just attack in the direction towards it. The previous attempt to attack-east caused an error, so perhaps the correct syntax is to use ""attack"" followed by the direction, like ""attack east"". Let me check the possible actions again. The allowed actions are movement directions and maybe attack commands. The user listed possible actions as north, east, south, west, etc., but didn't mention attack. However, in the game, attacking might be a separate action. Wait, looking back at the problem statement, the possible actions are only the movement directions. So maybe attacking isn't a listed action here. That complicates things. 

If attacking isn't a valid action, then the agent has to move to a position where the rat is adjacent and then possibly attack. But since the agent can't attack directly, maybe the only option is to move away from the rat to find the stairs down. But the stairs down location isn't specified yet. The current observations only mention stairs up. 

Since the goal is to reach the stairs down, and the stairs up are westsouthwest, perhaps the agent needs to go the opposite direction. But without knowing where the stairs down are, maybe the agent should keep exploring. The agent has been moving around, hitting walls, and now there's a rat. Maybe moving southwest or south could help. 

Looking at the cursor position (25,13), moving southwest would take to (24,12). The language observation says horizontal wall near north, vertical wall near west, and stairs up adjacent west. So moving southwest might lead to a corridor. Alternatively, moving south to (25,14), but the horizontal wall is adjacent south and southwest. So south might be a wall. 

Another option is to move east, but the rat is there. If the agent moves east, it might get bitten again. So perhaps the best move is to move southwest to (24,12) and see if there's a path. Alternatively, move north, but the horizontal wall is near north. 

Wait, the language observation says ""horizontal wall near north"" and ""horizontal wall adjacent south and southwest"". So moving north would hit a wall. Moving south is adjacent to a horizontal wall, so probably a wall. Moving east is adjacent to the rat. Moving west is a vertical wall. So the only viable movement is southwest. 

So the next action should be southwest to explore further and perhaps find the stairs down.

43,west,"<reasoning>
Let's see where I am. The agent is at position (25,13). The stairs up are very near the westsouthwest, so I need to head towards there. There's a giant rat adjacent to the northeast. I was trying to move southwest earlier but got a wall message. The map shows horizontal walls around here. Maybe I need to adjust direction.

Since the stairs are westsouthwest, perhaps moving west again would help. Let me check the language observation. The vertical wall is near west, but maybe there's a passage next to it. Alternatively, moving south might open up a path. The giant rat is nearby to the northeast, so attacking it could be a priority since it's biting. But the attack-east action wasn't valid because the previous attempt tried to attack in a direction that's a wall. Wait, the last action was southwest, and now the rat is adjacent northeast. So maybe the agent is positioned such that the rat is to the northeast, which would mean the agent is at (25,13) and the rat is at (26,13) or (25,14)? Need to visualize the map.

The map shows |...r###| on the third line, with the agent's position marked as @. So the agent is in the fourth position of that line. The rat is represented by 'r' in the third position. So the rat is to the west of the agent. Wait, the map's third line is |...r###|, so positions 0: |, 1: ., 2: ., 3: ., 4: r, 5: #, etc. The agent's position is at (25,13), which would correspond to the '@' in the line |.<@|. So maybe the agent is in the fourth position of that line, and the rat is in the third position (west of the agent). That would mean the rat is adjacent to the agent's west. But the language observation says the giant rat is adjacent northeast. Hmm, there's a discrepancy here. Maybe the map and the language observation are not perfectly aligned, or I'm misinterpreting the coordinates.

Alternatively, the agent is at (25,13), and the rat is at (26,13) which would be east. But the language observation says the rat is adjacent northeast. Maybe the rat is to the northeast, so (26,14). But the map shows the rat in the third line as 'r' in the fourth position. Let me think again. The map's third line after the initial few lines is |...r###|, so the rat is in the fourth tile of that line. If the agent is at position (25,13), which is the '@' in the line |.<@|, then the rat is to the west of the agent. That would make the rat's position (24,13). But the language observation says the rat is adjacent northeast. Maybe there's a mistake in the observation or the map rendering. 

Alternatively, perhaps the agent's position is such that moving west would take them towards the stairs. The stairs are westsouthwest, so combining west and south movements. Since moving southwest earlier resulted in a wall, maybe I need to try moving west first. Let's check the language observation again. It mentions vertical walls near west, horizontal walls near north, and stairs up adjacent west. So the stairs are to the west of the agent's current position. Therefore, moving west should reach the stairs. However, the previous attempt to move southwest resulted in a wall, so perhaps the path is blocked there. 

The agent has a +1 long sword, so attacking the rat is feasible. If the rat is adjacent, the correct action would be 'attack-west' since the rat is to the west. But the previous attempt to attack-east was invalid because the agent was trying to attack in a direction that's a wall. Wait, the last action was 'attack-east', which resulted in an error message because it's a wall. That suggests that the rat isn't to the east. So maybe the rat is to the north or another direction. 

Alternatively, perhaps the agent should move towards the stairs first, avoiding the rat. Since the stairs are westsouthwest, moving southwest might be the way, but that hit a wall. Maybe moving west and then south. Let me try to visualize the map again. The agent is at (25,13). The stairs up are adjacent west, so moving west to (24,13) would reach the stairs. But the language observation says vertical wall near west, so moving west might hit a wall. Wait, that seems conflicting. The stairs are adjacent west, so there should be a passage there. Maybe the vertical wall is adjacent to the west but not directly in the path. 

Alternatively, the stairs are in a corridor that's west of the agent. The agent needs to navigate around the walls. Since moving southwest resulted in a wall, perhaps moving south first, then west. Let me check the language observation again. The horizontal wall is adjacent south and southwest. So moving south would hit a wall, but moving southwest might also hit a wall. If the agent moves west, perhaps they can get to the stairs. 

Wait, the language observation says stairs up adjacent west. So moving west from (25,13) would take the agent to (24,13), which is where the stairs are. But the vertical wall is near west, so maybe the stairs are in a different position. This is confusing. Perhaps the best approach is to attack the rat to eliminate the threat. If the rat is adjacent west, then 'attack-west' would work. But the previous attempt to attack-east was invalid. So maybe the rat is to the north or southeast. 

Alternatively, since the agent has a long sword, maybe they can attack in a direction even if there's a wall, but that's unlikely. The correct action is to move towards the stairs while avoiding the rat. Given the confusion in directions, perhaps the safest move is to move west towards the stairs, assuming the vertical wall is not in the direct path. Alternatively, move south and then west. 

Another thought: the agent's inventory has a +1 long sword, so attacking is possible. If the rat is adjacent, attacking it would reduce the threat. Given that the previous attack-east was invalid, perhaps the rat is actually to the west. So 'attack-west' could be the correct action. Alternatively, move west to reach the stairs. 

Considering that the stairs are adjacent west, moving west should be the priority. Even if there's a vertical wall, perhaps it's a corner, and the stairs are around the corner. So moving west would take the agent to the stairs. Therefore, the next action should be 'west' to reach the stairs up.

44,northeast,"<reasoning>
I'm trying to navigate through this MiniHack game. The goal is to reach the stairs down. Let me look at the current situation.

From the last observation, I'm at position (24,13). The stairs up are adjacent to the southwest, which is where I was moving before. But the last move to southwest hit a wall. Hmm. The language observation mentions a horizontal wall near north and vertical walls nearby. The giant rat is adjacent to the northeast. So, there's a rat nearby that's a threat.

I need to get past the walls to find the stairs down. Let's check the map. The map shows some walls in the vicinity. The stairs up are southwest, but I can't go there directly because of the wall. Maybe I should try moving around the walls. Since there's a horizontal wall to the north, maybe moving south could open up a path.

Alternatively, since the stairs down are the target, and stairs up are present but not the goal, I should focus on exploring other directions. The rat is a problem; attacking it might be necessary to avoid damage. But the previous attempt to attack east (where the rat is) resulted in a wall because the action was invalid. Maybe I need to move closer to the rat first.

Looking at the cursor position and the rat's location, the rat is adjacent northeast. So, if I move northeast, I can attack it. But I need to check if that's possible. Wait, the last move was southwest and hit a wall. So, moving northeast from (24,13) would take me to (25,14), which might be a valid space. Let me confirm the map layout.

The map shows at position (25,14) there's a # which might be a wall or part of the structure. If moving northeast is blocked, then perhaps another direction is needed. Alternatively, moving south might lead away from the walls and towards open areas.

Another thought: since the horizontal wall is to the north, moving south could get me past that. Checking the observations, after moving west, the language observation mentions horizontal walls adjacent south and southwest. So moving south from (24,13) might be possible.

Wait, the current map shows at (24,13) the @ is positioned, with the map row having |.@.|, which suggests that the agent is in the middle of that row. The horizontal walls are north and south. So moving south from here would take me to a new row, perhaps with different terrain.

Also, the stairs down are usually at the bottom of the dungeon, but since I'm on Dlvl:1, maybe the stairs are in a different location. The initial observations mentioned stairs up near westsouthwest, but the goal is stairs down. Need to find where those are.

Considering all this, perhaps moving south to explore further, then check other directions. Alternatively, try to circle around the vertical walls. Since the vertical walls are west, northeast, east, and northwest, moving east might be possible if there's a gap. But from the map, the east direction seems to have walls as well.

Alternatively, since the rat is nearby, attacking it could be a priority to prevent damage. But the previous attack command 'attack-east' was invalid because the action wasn't properly formatted. The allowed actions are the movement ones like north, south, etc., or perhaps 'kick' or 'shoot', but the user didn't list those. Wait, the initial list of possible actions only includes movement directions. So maybe attacking isn't an available action, or it's a command like 'kick east'.

But according to the problem statement, the possible actions are the movement directions. So perhaps I need to approach the rat by moving closer and then use a weapon. Since I have a +1 long sword, maybe I can attack when adjacent.

Given that, moving northeast from (24,13) to (25,14) where the rat is adjacent might allow me to attack. But I need to check if that square is passable. The map shows at (25,14) there's a 'r' for the rat, which is a mobile entity, so that square is accessible.

So the plan is: move northeast to (25,14) to attack the rat, then proceed. Alternatively, if that's blocked, try another direction. But according to the current map, moving northeast should be possible since the rat is there.

Another option is to move south to explore downwards, which might lead to the stairs down. The language observation mentions horizontal walls adjacent south and southwest, so moving south could be a way out.

But let's prioritize dealing with the rat to avoid damage. So the next action should be to move northeast to attack it. Since the allowed actions are movement, I'll choose 'northeast' to get into position to attack.

Let's see where I am. The goal is to reach the stairs down. From the map, stairs up are at westsouthwest, but I need to find the stairs down. The current observation shows stairs up near westsouthwest, but not down. So, I need to explore more.

The agent is at (25,12). The giant rat is adjacent east. The last action was northeast, which might have moved me towards the rat. The message says the rat bit, so it's close. I need to either fight it or avoid it to reach the stairs.

Looking at the language observations: vertical walls are near west, horizontal walls near north and south. The stairs up are southwest, but stairs down are probably elsewhere. Maybe I should move away from the rat towards the southwest where the stairs up are, but that's not down. Wait, maybe I need to check other directions.

The map shows some horizontal walls, so there are rooms or corridors. The agent is in a part with horizontal walls to the north and south. The stairs up are southwest, but stairs down could be in another part of the level. Since the agent can't see stairs down yet, exploration is needed.

Possible moves: west, south, southeast, or maybe northeast again. But the rat is to the east, so moving east is bad. Let's check the adjacent areas. Moving southwest might lead towards the stairs up, but that's not down. Alternatively, moving south could get away from the rat and explore another area.

Wait, the cursor's position is (25,12). The stairs up are southwest, so moving southwest from here would be (24,11), perhaps. But stairs down are likely in a different location. The agent needs to wander around, avoiding walls, and look for any down stairs.

The previous actions were west multiple times, then southwest, south, etc. Maybe trying to move in a direction that hasn't been explored yet. For example, moving south from (25,12) could lead into a new area. Alternatively, moving southeast might open up a path.

But the rat is adjacent east, so moving south or southwest might be better. Let's check the language observation again: dark areas adjacent north, northeast, southeast, south, southwest, and northwest. Wait, no, the current language observation says after moving northeast to (25,12), the adjacent areas are dark except for stairs up southwest. The vertical walls are near west, and horizontal walls north, south, southwest, northwest.

So possible directions: south, maybe. Or west again. Wait, moving west from (25,12) would be (24,12), which might be a passage. Let's check the map. The map shows at (24,12) there's a '@' symbol, which is the agent. The map's third line from the top is ""|..@r###|"", so the agent is at position 24,12, with the rat to the east (25,12). So moving west would take the agent to (24,12), which is a corridor.

Alternatively, moving south from (25,12) to (25,13). The language observation says horizontal wall adjacent south, so maybe a wall there. If moving south hits a wall, then perhaps another direction is needed.

The goal is to reach stairs down. Since stairs down aren't visible yet, the agent needs to explore. The best move might be to move west to (24,12), which is likely a path, avoiding the rat. Then from there, check other directions. Alternatively, moving southwest to (24,11) might lead somewhere.

But the agent should avoid repeating the same actions. Previous steps included west, southwest, south, etc. Let's try moving west to (24,12) to see if that's a valid path. The cursor is at (25,12), so west would be (24,12). The language observation says vertical wall near west, but that's probably the same wall at (24,12) west direction. Wait, the vertical wall is very near west, so at (24,12) west is a wall. So moving west from (25,12) would hit the vertical wall. Therefore, west is not possible. Then, the agent should try another direction.

Looking at the language observation: dark areas adjacent south, southeast, etc. The horizontal wall is adjacent south, so moving south would hit a wall. Therefore, south is out. The agent should try moving southeast or northeast. But the rat is to the east, so northeast would bring the agent closer. Maybe southwest instead.

Wait, from (25,12), moving southwest would be to (24,11). The language observation says horizontal wall adjacent southwest. So that might be a wall. Alternatively, maybe it's a passage. The agent needs to check. But since the previous move to southwest resulted in a wall, maybe another direction.

What about moving north? The horizontal wall is near north, so moving north would hit a wall. Not helpful. The only remaining options might be east, but that's the rat. So perhaps the agent needs to move in a different pattern.

Alternatively, maybe the agent should attack the rat. Since the rat is adjacent, using the attack-east action could deal damage. The agent has a +1 long sword, so attacking makes sense. However, the previous attempt to attack-east resulted in a default north move because the action wasn't recognized. So the correct action format is needed.

The available actions are the movement directions. To attack, the correct action format in MiniHack might be 'attack east' or similar. But the user's initial list only includes movement actions. Wait, looking back at the problem statement: the possible actions are the directions listed (north, east, etc.), and there's no mention of attack actions. So the agent must use movement to proximity and then perhaps use another action, but according to the given actions, only movement is possible. Therefore, the agent should try to get into a position to attack, maybe by luring the rat into a corner, but given the action constraints, movement is the only option.

Given that, the agent should move away from the rat to find stairs down. Since moving west is a wall, south is a wall, north is a wall, east is the rat, the only possible direction is perhaps southwest, but that's a wall. Wait, this is confusing. Let me recheck the language observation.

Current language observation: dark area near east (rat), vertical wall near west, horizontal wall very near north, south, southwest, northwest. Vertical wall adjacent northeast and southeast. So from (25,12), moving northeast would hit the vertical wall (since vertical wall is adjacent northeast). Moving southeast would also hit the vertical wall. Moving southwest is adjacent to a horizontal wall. So the only possible movement is north (hits horizontal wall), south (hits horizontal wall), west (hits vertical wall), east (rat). So all primary directions are blocked except maybe diagonal movements?

Wait, the allowed actions include diagonal movements like northeast, northwest, etc. From (25,12), moving southwest would be to (24,11). The language observation says horizontal wall adjacent southwest. Does that mean there's a wall at (24,11)? If so, moving southwest would be a wall. Alternatively, maybe it's a passage. But the agent previously tried southwest and got ""It's a wall."" So that's blocked.

In that case, the agent is stuck in a corner with the rat adjacent. The only way out is to either fight the rat (using movement to get it into a position where it can't bite) or find a way past. But given the current observations, the agent might need to wait for the rat to move, but MiniHack typically doesn't allow idle actions; the agent must keep moving.

Alternatively, perhaps the agent can move in a diagonal that's not directly adjacent. For example, moving northwest from (25,12) to (24,11). Wait, northwest would be up and left. From (25,12), northwest is (24,11). The language observation says horizontal wall adjacent southwest, but not sure about northwest. Let me check the map again.

The map shows at (25,12) the agent is at '@', and the rat is at 'r' to the east. The horizontal walls are very near north, south, southwest, and northwest. So moving northwest from (25,12) would go to (24,11), which is adjacent to a horizontal wall (northwest). So that's a wall. Therefore, moving northwest is blocked.

Similarly, moving northeast would go to (26,13), which is adjacent to a vertical wall (east). So that's blocked.

This seems like the agent is trapped between walls and the rat. The only possible move might be to lure the rat into a corner by moving in a certain direction, but given the current layout, it's challenging.

Wait, the stairs up are southwest at (westsouthwest) from the agent's position. Maybe moving southwest multiple times could lead to them, but previously that hit a wall. Alternatively, perhaps the agent needs to move in a different pattern.

Another approach: since the agent has a sword, maybe attacking the rat when possible. But the action 'attack-east' wasn't recognized earlier, perhaps because the correct format is different. The user's initial instructions listed only movement actions, so maybe attacking isn't an option here. The agent must use movement to get into a position to attack, but according to the problem statement, the only allowed actions are the movement directions.

Given that, the agent is stuck. The best action might be to move in a direction that hasn't been tried yet, but all primary directions are blocked. Alternatively, perhaps the agent should try moving in a diagonal that's not directly adjacent. For example, moving southwest twice, but that would hit the wall.

Alternatively, the agent can try to move around the rat by moving south or north, but those are blocked by horizontal walls. This is a problem. Maybe the agent needs to retrace steps. For example, moving back east to (26,12), but the rat is there. Wait, the rat is adjacent east, so moving east would enter its tile, possibly triggering an attack.

Given the constraints, the only viable move might be to move west, but that's a wall. So perhaps the agent is stuck and needs to wait for the rat to move, but in MiniHack, the NPC (rat) might not move on its own unless the agent does something. Alternatively, the agent can try to move in a way that the rat follows, creating a path.

Alternatively, maybe the agent should pick up an item, but the inventory shows a sword, armor, etc., so no need. The priority is to reach the stairs down. Since stairs down aren't visible, exploration is key.

Wait, the initial problem states the goal is to reach the stairs down. The agent has to explore the level. Given the current position and observations, the best bet is to keep moving in directions that haven't been fully explored. For example, moving southwest from (25,12) to (24,11) even if it's a wall, but that was previously a wall. Alternatively, moving south to (25,13), but that's a horizontal wall.

This is tricky. Maybe the agent should try moving in a different diagonal. For example, moving southeast from (25,12) to (26,13). The language observation says vertical wall adjacent southeast, so that's a wall. Not helpful.

Alternatively, moving northeast to (26,13), which is adjacent to a vertical wall (east). Also blocked.

In this case, the agent might be in a dead end with the rat. The only possible action is to attack, but since attacking isn't an allowed action here, the agent has to move. Since all primary directions are blocked, the agent might have to move in a way that eventually leads to exploration.

Wait, maybe the agent can move northwest past the horizontal wall. From (25,12), moving northwest to (24,11), which is adjacent to a horizontal wall (northwest). If that's a wall, then can't go. Alternatively, perhaps the agent can move north past the horizontal wall, but that's a wall.

I think the agent is stuck. The only possible move is to attack, but since that's not an option, the agent has to wait. However, in MiniHack, the agent must perform an action each step. Therefore, the best possible action is to move in a direction that hasn't been tried yet, even if it's likely a wall, to see if there's a change.

Alternatively, perhaps the agent should move back to a previous position. For example, moving north to (25,11), but that's a horizontal wall. No.

Given all this, the only feasible action is to move west, but that's a wall. So perhaps the agent has to stay put, but that's not possible. Therefore, the correct action is to try moving southwest again, even though it's a wall, but the agent might have missed something.

Wait, the current cursor position is (25,12). The language observation says horizontal wall adjacent southwest. Moving southwest would be to (24,11), which is adjacent to a horizontal wall. So it's a wall. Therefore, the agent can't move there.

In this case, the agent might have to accept that it's trapped for now and try to find another way. Given the lack of options, the best action is to move west, even though it's a wall, to see if the observation changes. But the observation previously said it's a wall, so maybe it's consistent.

Alternatively, the agent can try moving in a different diagonal, like northwest, but that's also a wall.

Hmm. This is a challenging situation. Maybe the agent should try moving east towards the rat to attack, but that's risky. Moving east to (26,12) where the rat is. The message says the rat bites, reducing HP. But perhaps after a few attacks, the rat might die. However, since attacking isn't an allowed action here, the agent can't do that.

Given the constraints, the only possible action is to move in a direction that is not a wall. But all directions seem blocked. This suggests that the agent might be in a loop, and the previous actions need to be revisited.

Wait, looking back at the history, the agent moved west multiple times, then southwest, south, etc. Perhaps backtracking to an earlier position could help. For example, moving back east to (26,12), but that's where the rat is. Alternatively, moving north to (25,11), which is a wall.

I think the agent is stuck here. The only possible move is to move southwest, but it's a wall. Therefore, the agent has to stay put, but that's not possible. So the best action is to keep trying to move in a different direction, even if it's a wall, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, the agent might have to accept that it needs to find another path.

Alternatively, perhaps the agent should move in a different pattern, like going around the rat. For example, moving south to (25,13), but that's a wall. Then moving west to (24,13), which might be a passage.

Wait, the language observation says horizontal wall adjacent south, so moving south to (25,13) is a wall. Moving west from (25,12) is a vertical wall. Moving northwest to (24,11) is a horizontal wall. Moving northeast to (26,13) is a vertical wall. Moving southeast to (26,12) is the rat.

This is really a dead end. The agent might be in a room with the rat and surrounded by walls. The only way out is to defeat the rat, but without attack actions, it's impossible. Therefore, the agent is stuck and cannot proceed further, which is a problem.

But since the goal is to reach the stairs down, perhaps the agent needs to find another part of the level. Given that the stairs up are at westsouthwest, maybe the stairs down are in the opposite direction. So the agent should move away from the stairs up towards the east or north, but the layout doesn't allow that.

Alternatively, perhaps the agent should try to move in a diagonal direction that's not directly adjacent. For example, moving northeast twice, but that would hit the vertical wall.

I think the correct action here is to move west, even though it's a wall, to see if the observation changes. But the previous attempt showed it's a wall. Alternatively, the agent can try moving north again, but that's a wall.

Given the lack of options, the agent has to make a move that hasn't been tried yet. Maybe moving southwest again, but it's a wall. So the only possible action is to output 'west' again, but the observation says it's a wall. This is a problem.

Wait, the agent's current position is (25,12). The stairs up are southwest at (24,11), but that's a wall. The only way to proceed is to find another path. Maybe the agent should move north to (25,11), which is a wall, then west to (24,11), which is also a wall. This isn't working.

In conclusion, given the current observations and allowed actions, the only possible valid move is to move west, but it's a wall. Therefore, the agent is stuck. However, since the agent must choose an action, the best possible choice is to move southwest again, even though it's a wall, to see if there's a change in observation. Alternatively, the agent might have to retrace steps to an earlier position where movement was possible.

But looking back at the history, the agent was at (26,12) earlier. Maybe moving back east to (26,12) could help. From there, the agent can try different directions. But moving east to (26,12) would enter the rat's tile, causing another bite. However, the agent's HP is at 13, so taking another bite would reduce it to 11, which is still survivable.

So the action could be 'east', moving into the rat's tile, hoping to maybe get lucky and find a passage or stairs there. Alternatively, the agent might have to take that risk.

Alternatively, the agent can try moving north from (25,12) to (25,11), which is a wall, but perhaps there's a different observation.

Given the constraints, the best action is to move east towards the rat, accepting the bite, in the hope that it leads to a new area or stairs down.

Let's see. The goal is to reach the stairs down. The current observations show that there's a giant rat adjacent to the east. The stairs up are southwest, but the player needs to go downstairs eventually. However, right now, the immediate threat is the rat.

The agent's position is (25,12). The stairs down aren't visible in the current observations, so maybe they're in a different part of the level. The previous actions have moved the agent around, trying to navigate the walls and avoid the rat. 

Looking at the language observation, there's a vertical wall to the north and south. Stairs up are southwest, but the agent needs to explore further. The giant rat is nearby, so attacking it might be necessary to proceed safely. 

The inventory has a +1 long sword, which is good for combat. The last action was moving east, but the rat is still adjacent. The message says ""You miss,"" so the attack was unsuccessful. Maybe the agent needs to reposition for a better attack angle. 

Possible actions: Attack again, move to a different direction to avoid the rat, or check other directions for stairs. Since the stairs down aren't mentioned yet, exploration is key. Maybe moving southwest towards the stairs up first, but that's upstairs. Alternatively, moving in another direction to find a path downward. 

Wait, the initial goal was to reach the stairs down, not up. So the agent needs to find the down stairs. The current stairs up are at westsouthwest, but maybe there's another set of stairs down elsewhere. The agent should keep exploring different directions, avoiding the rat. 

The agent could try to go around the rat. Since the rat is to the east, moving west might get closer to a wall, but moving south or north could create distance. Alternatively, attacking again from a different angle. 

But attacking might not be the most efficient. Maybe the agent should move south or north to find a path that leads away from the rat and towards the down stairs. Let's check the map layout. The current map shows some walls, so movement is constrained. 

The agent's last position was (25,12) after moving east. The stairs up are southwest, so moving southwest from there would be (24,11), but there's a horizontal wall there. Alternatively, moving south to (25,11) might be possible if there's no wall. 

Looking at the language observation, there's a vertical wall adjacent north and south. So moving north or south from (25,12) would hit a wall. Therefore, the agent can't move north or south. The only open directions are west, east (blocked by rat), maybe northeast or northwest? 

Wait, the vertical walls are north and south. The horizontal walls are very near north, south, southwest, and northwest. So moving north or south is blocked by walls. East is blocked by the rat. So the agent can move west, northeast, or northwest. 

But moving west would take the agent back towards the stairs up, which isn't helpful for descending. Moving northeast or northwest might lead to new areas. Let's see. 

If the agent moves northwest to (24,11), but the language observation says there's a horizontal wall adjacent southwest and northwest. So that area might have a wall. Alternatively, moving northeast to (26,11) – but the vertical walls are near west and east. Not sure. 

Alternatively, since the rat is adjacent east, maybe luring it away or attacking from a distance. But the agent's weapon is a sword, which requires melee range. So the agent has to be adjacent to the rat to attack. 

The agent's HP is 13, and the rat can bite, so avoiding unnecessary attacks is important. Maybe the best move is to move west towards the stairs up, but that's upwards. Alternatively, move southwest towards the stairs up, but again, that's up. 

Wait, the goal is to reach the stairs down, which isn't mentioned in the current observations. So the agent needs to keep exploring. The previous movements have been trying to navigate the maze-like structure. 

Since the agent is at (25,12) with the rat to the east, and walls to the north and south, the possible safe moves are west or diagonal directions that aren't blocked. Let's try moving southwest again. 

But earlier attempts to move southwest resulted in hitting a wall. However, the cursor's position after moving southwest was (25,13), and the message said it was a wall. So perhaps that path is blocked. 

Alternatively, moving northwest to (24,11). The language observation mentions a horizontal wall very near southwest and northwest. If moving northwest leads to a wall, then that's not helpful. 

Another option is to attack the rat again, but the agent already missed. Maybe the rat is now in a different position. Wait, the last action was moving east, which brought the agent next to the rat. Then attacking east missed. So the rat might have moved? Or maybe the agent's attack was inaccurate. 

In any case, the agent needs to either defeat the rat or find a way around it. Since the rat is a common creature on the first level, defeating it could free up movement. 

The agent has a +1 long sword, which is good. Maybe a few more attacks would take down the rat. Let's try attacking east again. 

Alternatively, move south to (25,11), but there's a vertical wall there. So that's not possible. Move north to (25,13), which is also a wall. 

So the only possible movement is west or diagonally west. Moving west to (24,12) – checking the language observation, there's a horizontal wall very near southwest and northwest. So moving west might hit a wall. 

Wait, the cursor's position after moving west was (24,12), and the language observation said vertical wall near west. So moving west again would hit the wall. 

Hmm, this is tricky. The agent is stuck between a wall to the north, south, and west, with the rat to the east. The only open direction is perhaps moving east again, but the rat is there. 

Alternatively, the agent could try to attack the rat from a different angle. Maybe moving northeast or northwest and then attacking. But without knowing the map layout, it's hard to say. 

Given the constraints, the safest bet might be to attack the rat again, hoping to hit this time. Alternatively, move southwest to see if there's a way through. 

Wait, the previous move to southwest from (25,13) resulted in a wall. So that path is blocked. 

In this situation, the best action might be to attack the rat again, keeping it at bay while looking for an opening. Alternatively, try to reposition by moving west, but that's blocked. 

Another idea: since the agent has a shield (small shield), using it might improve defense, but the current action options don't include using the shield actively. The main actions are movement and attack. 

So, considering all this, the next action should be to attack the rat again, perhaps in a different direction. The agent is at (25,12), rat is at (26,12). Attacking east again. Maybe the rat moved, or the agent's previous attack missed due to positioning. 

Alternatively, move northeast to (26,11) and attack there. But need to check if that's possible. 

Wait, the agent's current position is (25,12). Moving northeast would take them to (26,11). Is that a valid move? The language observation says vertical walls near west and east, but not sure about northeast. 

Assuming that moving northeast is possible, the agent could position themselves to attack the rat from the side or behind. 

Alternatively, since the agent's last attack was east and missed, maybe trying a different direction, like southeast, but that's adjacent to the rat's position. 

This is getting complicated. Given the information, the best immediate action is to continue attacking the rat to eliminate it, allowing the agent to move freely afterward. So the next action should be 'attack-east' again.

The agent is trying to get to the stairs down. Let's check the current situation.

The agent is at (25,11). The stairs up are very near southsouthwest, which would be southwest direction. But wait, the latest observation says the stairs up are adjacent southwest. The problem is there's a giant rat nearby. The message says ""The giant rat bites!"" and now the agent's HP is down to 12.

First, the agent needs to eliminate the rat to avoid further damage. The inventory has a +1 long sword, which is good. The previous attempts to attack with 'attack-east' didn't work because maybe the action wasn't correctly formatted. The game requires using 'attack-east' to hit the rat to the east.

Looking at the current position, the rat is adjacent southeast. Wait, the language observation says the giant rat is adjacent southeast. But the cursor is at (25,11). So the rat would be at (26,11) or (25,12)? Need to check the map.

The map shows the agent's position as |..@| in the second row. The rat is marked as 'r' in the third row, third column, which is |...r###|, so the rat is at (25,13)? Hmm, maybe the coordinates are a bit off. Alternatively, the rat could be to the east of the agent. Wait, the agent is at (25,11), and the rat is adjacent southeast. Southeast from (25,11) would be (26,12). But in the map, the rat is in the third row, which is y=12. So maybe the rat is at (25,13)? Not sure. The map might be a bit confusing.

But regardless, the agent needs to attack the rat. The best action is 'attack-east' to make sure it's targeting the correct direction. The agent previously used 'attack-east' but it was invalid, so the game defaulted to north. Now, the agent should correctly use 'attack-east' to hit the rat. Once the rat is dead, the agent can move towards the stairs southwest.

So the priority is to attack the rat to the east. After defeating it, move southwest towards the stairs. Alternatively, if moving towards the stairs is possible without interfering with the rat, but the agent is surrounded by walls and dark areas. The stairs are southwest, so after dealing with the rat, moving southwest should lead to the stairs.

Let's see. The agent is trying to reach the stairs down in MiniHack. The current observation shows that the giant rat is adjacent to the southeast, and the stairs up are very near the southsouthwest. But the goal is to reach the stairs down, so maybe there's a different staircase? I need to check the map again.

Looking at the language observation, there's a horizontal wall near the south, and the stairs up are in the southsouthwest. The agent's position is (25,11). The previous attempts to attack the rat with 'attack-east' didn't work because that's not a valid action in MiniHack; valid actions are movement or other specific commands like kick or attack in a direction.

The agent's inventory includes a +1 long sword, which is good for attacking. The last valid action was 'north', which hit a wall. Now, the task is to either defeat the rat or find a way to the stairs down. Since the stairs down aren't mentioned in the current observations, maybe the rat is blocking a path to them. Alternatively, the agent might need to explore more of the level.

The agent is surrounded by walls except for north, which is a wall, east which has the rat, south which might be a corridor, and west which has a vertical wall. Maybe moving south could lead to a new area. Alternatively, attacking the rat with the correct action, like 'attack east' using the sword. Wait, in MiniHack, to attack, you need to specify the direction, like '_attack east' or just 'attack-east' depending on the interface. Since previous attempts to 'attack-east' were invalid, maybe the correct format is '_attack east' or another command.

Alternatively, maybe the agent should move around the rat to reach the stairs. Since the stairs up are in the southsouthwest, perhaps moving southwest or south could lead to them. But the language observation says stairs up are very near southsouthwest, but the goal is stairs down. Maybe there's another staircase elsewhere.

The agent's current position is (25,11). Moving south to (25,12) might be possible if there's a floor there. The map shows a @ symbol at (25,12) with some walls. Wait, the map might be a bit confusing. The agent's current position after the last move was (25,11), and the map shows |..@| on line 2, which could correspond to y=11. So moving south from (25,11) would be to y=12, which might be a passable area.

Alternatively, moving west from (25,11) might hit a vertical wall. The language observation says vertical wall adjacent east, which is the rat's position. So east is blocked by the rat, north is a wall. Maybe moving south to explore further. Let's check the language observation again: horizontal wall adjacent north and northwest. So north is a wall, but south might be passable. If the agent moves south to (25,12), maybe there's a corridor leading to stairs down.

Another option is to fight the rat. Since the agent has a sword, using 'attack east' properly. Maybe the correct action is '_attack east' or using the weapon explicitly. But previous attempts were invalid, so perhaps the interface requires a different format. Alternatively, the agent can try to kick the rat, but that's risky. Maybe moving around the rat to the southwest or southeast.

Wait, the stairs up are in the southsouthwest, but the agent needs stairs down. Maybe the level has multiple staircases. The agent should explore more. Moving southwest from (25,11) would be to (24,12). Let's see the language observation for that area: horizontal wall adjacent south and southwest. So moving southwest might hit a wall. Alternatively, moving south to (25,12) and then west.

Alternatively, the agent can try to pick a direction that's not a wall. Since north is a wall, east is the rat, west is a vertical wall, south might be a way. So moving south to (25,12) could be the next step. Let's check the map again. At (25,12), the map shows |..@|, which might mean the agent is there, and the surrounding areas. If moving south, perhaps there's a corridor. Then from there, check for stairs down.

Alternatively, since the stairs up are in the southwest, maybe the stairs down are in the opposite direction, like northeast. But that's just a guess. The agent needs to explore systematically. Let's try moving south first.

Let's see. The goal is to reach the stairs down. The agent has been moving around, fighting the giant rat. The latest observation shows the agent is at (25,12) with the giant rat adjacent east. The stairs up are southwest. The agent tried attacking east before but the action wasn't valid, so it defaulted to north. Now, after moving south, the rat missed.

The inventory has a +1 long sword, which is good for fighting. The agent needs to focus on defeating the rat to clear the path. Stairs are southwest, but the rat is blocking the way. If the agent can kill the rat, then moving southwest towards the stairs makes sense.

Looking at the map, the agent is near vertical walls and horizontal walls. The previous attempts to attack east resulted in either the action being invalid or missing. Maybe the agent needs to get closer. The current position is (25,12), rat is east, so moving east would get closer. But earlier attempts to go east hit walls or didn't work. Wait, the language observation says vertical wall adjacent east, so moving east is a wall. That explains why previous east moves didn't work.

So the rat is adjacent east, but the agent can't move east directly. The agent is next to a wall. Therefore, the best approach is to attack the rat from the current position. Since the sword is equipped, attacking east should work, but previous attempts failed because of invalid actions. Maybe the correct action is 'attack east' again, but the system didn't accept it before. Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to reposition.

Alternatively, check if there's another way to attack. The agent is at (25,12), rat is at (26,12). The agent's position is on the map with @, rat is 'r'. The map shows |..@r###|, so the agent is in the third cell, rat in the fourth. The vertical walls are to the east, so the rat is right next to the wall. The agent needs to attack the rat. The correct action should be 'attack east' to hit the rat.

But earlier, when the user tried 'attack-east', the system said it was invalid and defaulted to north. Maybe the correct format is just 'attack east' without the hyphen. Let me check the previous actions. The initial allowed actions include 'attack-east' as a possible action. Wait, the user's initial list of actions didn't mention 'attack', only movement. Oh, maybe in MiniHack, the valid actions are movement and specific commands like 'attack'. But the user's list of possible actions only includes movement directions. Hmm, perhaps the 'attack' action is not in the listed possible actions, so the agent should use a movement action towards the rat to attack. But in the game, maybe the correct way is to use the 'attack' command with a direction.

Wait, the problem statement says the possible actions are the movement directions listed. So the agent can only move in those 8 directions or northeast, etc. But attacking would require a different action. However, in the game, attacking is typically done by moving towards the enemy. So maybe the agent should move east to attack. But earlier attempts to move east resulted in a wall. That's confusing because the rat is adjacent east. So maybe the map configuration has the rat in a different position.

Looking at the map:

In the latest observation, the map shows:

                      |..@r###                                                  
                      |.<.|                                                     
                      ----- 

So the agent's position is at the third cell of the second row (assuming the rows are vertical). The 'r' is in the fourth cell of the second row. So the agent is at (25,12), and the rat is at (26,12). The vertical walls are adjacent east, meaning that moving east from (25,12) is a wall. But the rat is there. That suggests that the rat is in a cell that's blocked by a wall, which might be an error, or the rat is in a corridor next to the wall. Alternatively, maybe the map representation is different. 

In any case, the agent can't move east, so attacking east might not be possible via movement. The only option is to attack using the attack command. But since the allowed actions are only movement, perhaps the agent needs to use a different strategy. 

Alternatively, the agent can try to flank the rat. Since the stairs are southwest, maybe moving southwest away from the rat to reach the stairs. But the rat is between the agent and the stairs. So defeating the rat is necessary.

Given that attacking east wasn't working due to invalid actions, perhaps the agent should try a different approach. Maybe using the weapon in hand (long sword) by attacking in the direction of the rat. If the game allows attacking without moving, the action would be 'attack east'. But since the system didn't accept it before, maybe the correct format is different. Alternatively, the agent should try to move in a direction that allows attacking, but given the walls, that's not possible.

Wait, the agent's current position is (25,12), rat at (26,12). The agent's cursor is on the '@', and the rat is 'r'. The vertical wall adjacent east means that cell (26,12) is a wall? But the rat is there. That's a contradiction. Maybe the map is not accurately reflecting the rat's position. Alternatively, the rat is in a different cell. 

Alternatively, the agent needs to check the map again. The map shows:

...@r### in the second row. So cells 3 is '@', 4 is 'r', then three '#'. The vertical walls are adjacent east, so cell 4 (east of agent) is a wall. But the rat is in cell 4. That can't be. So perhaps the map is incorrect, or the rat is in a different position. This is confusing. 

Given the confusion, the safest bet is to try attacking the rat again, even if the previous attempt failed. Maybe the formatting was wrong. So the action should be 'attack east' without the hyphen. Or perhaps 'attack-east' is the correct format. But the system previously defaulted to north when 'attack-east' was used. Maybe the game requires a different action, like 'slash east' or 'stab east'. But according to the initial list of possible actions, only movement is allowed. 

Alternatively, the agent can try to move in a direction that allows attacking, but given the walls, that's not possible. So the only option is to keep attacking east. Maybe the previous invalid action was due to a typo, and the correct format is 'attack-east'. Let's try that again.

I need to figure out the next best move here. Let's look at the current situation. The agent is a knight at (25, 11) on level 1. The stairs down are probably somewhere, but in the previous observations, the stairs up were at southwest, so maybe the stairs down are in the opposite direction or another part of the map. The main challenge here is the giant rat that's been attacking the agent. The agent's health is down to 9, which is low, so avoiding or defeating the rat is crucial.

Looking at the map, there's a horizontal wall to the north and northwest, vertical walls to the east and northeast. The giant rat is adjacent to the southeast. The agent is wielding a +1 long sword, which is good, but the rat is biting repeatedly. The previous attempts to attack east (where the rat is) with 'attack-east' didn't work because the system didn't recognize that action. Instead, it defaulted to 'north', leading to more bites. So I need to use a valid action to attack the rat.

Valid actions are movement directions or specific commands like 'kick', 'attack', or using items. Since 'attack-east' isn't a valid action in MiniHack, I should use the 'attack' command with the direction. The correct format might be 'attack east' or just 'east' if the system allows attacking in the direction of the monster. Alternatively, maybe 'fight east' is another option. Let me check the possible actions again. The initial list only includes movement directions, but the game might allow combat actions like 'kick' or 'attack' in a direction.

Looking at the previous messages, when the user tried 'attack-east', it was invalid. So perhaps the correct action is to move closer to the rat and then attack. The rat is to the southeast, so moving southeast might get the agent next to the rat, allowing a more effective attack. Alternatively, the agent can try to attack from the current position if possible.

Wait, the agent's current position is (25,11). The rat is adjacent southeast. So the rat is either at (26,12) or (25,12) or (26,11). Depending on the map layout, moving southeast might place the agent in a position to attack. Alternatively, using the 'attack' command with the direction 'southeast' if that's allowed.

Another approach is to use the 'kick' command, which is sometimes available to dislodge monsters. Maybe 'kick southeast' could work. Also, the agent has a shield, gloves, and armor, which might help in defense.

Since the agent's HP is low, it's better to either defeat the rat or find a safe position to attack. If moving closer is possible without getting bitten, that might be better. Let me check the language observation: ""giant rat adjacent southeast"". So the rat is right next to the agent to the southeast. Therefore, moving southeast would place the agent adjacent to the rat, allowing a better attack. Alternatively, attacking from the current position with 'attack southeast' if that's a valid action.

But given that previous 'attack-east' commands were invalid, perhaps the correct syntax is 'fight east' or just 'east' with the intent to attack. Alternatively, using the kick command. Let me think. In MiniHack, common actions for combat include 'kick' or 'attack' followed by a direction. Since the available actions listed initially only include movement, maybe the system expects using movement to get into position and then a default attack. But the agent is already adjacent, so maybe a simple 'attack' command without a direction, but that might not target correctly.

Alternatively, the agent can use the 'attack' command with the direction. If the game allows 'attack southeast', that would be ideal. Since the rat is adjacent southeast, attacking in that direction should work. Given that previous attempts to use 'attack-east' didn't work, perhaps the correct format is 'attack southeast'.

Another possibility is that the agent should pick up a weapon other than the sword, but the agent is already wielding the +1 long sword, which is the best weapon. So switching isn't necessary.

Considering all this, the best action is to attack the rat in the southeast direction. The valid action would be 'attack southeast' if that's permitted. Alternatively, 'fight southeast'. Since the previous invalid action was 'attack-east', maybe the correct syntax uses 'southeast' instead of 'east'. Therefore, the chosen action should be 'attack southeast' to target the rat directly and reduce its health, ending the combat and allowing the agent to proceed to explore further or find the stairs down.

The agent is trying to reach the stairs down in MiniHack. The problem now is that the previous attempts using attack-east or attack southeast aren't valid actions, so the default action was north. The message indicates that it's a wall when trying to go north. The current position is (25,11) with the giant rat adjacent to the southeast. The stairs up are nearby in the southwest.

First, I need to figure out how to get past the giant rat. The agent's inventory has a +1 long sword, so attacking is possible. But the last attempt to attack east or southeast wasn't recognized, maybe because those aren't valid directions here. The valid movement directions are the eight compass directions. Since the rat is to the southeast, maybe attacking in that direction is needed. But how to phrase that as a valid action?

Wait, in MiniHack, combat actions like attacking are typically done by moving in the direction of the enemy. So to attack the rat, the agent needs to move towards it. The rat is adjacent southeast, so moving southeast might allow a melee attack. Alternatively, the attack action can be combined with a direction, like attack-southeast. But the user's initial list of actions didn't include attack commands, only movement. Hmm, this might be a problem.

Looking back at the initial instructions, the possible actions are the eight movement directions. There's no explicit attack command. So perhaps attacking is done by moving into the adjacent tile where the enemy is, which would trigger an automatic attack. So if the rat is to the southeast, moving southeast would result in an attack. But earlier attempts to move southeast resulted in a message about a wall. Wait, in the current observation, the language observation says ""vertical wall adjacent east"" and ""giant rat adjacent southeast"". So moving southeast from (25,11) would lead to the rat's position, but is there a wall there?

Wait, the map shows that at (25,12) there's a @ (agent) and at (26,12) there's an r (rat). So the agent is at (25,11), and moving southeast would take them to (26,12), which is where the rat is. But the language observation mentions a vertical wall adjacent east, which might be at (25,11) east, so (26,11). But the rat is at (26,12). So moving southeast from (25,11) is possible if there's no wall there. But the previous attempt to move southeast resulted in a wall message. Wait, looking at the map, the current map shows:

At y=12, the agent's row has |..@r###|, which suggests that at (25,12) is the agent's position (@), and (26,12) is the rat (r). So moving southeast from (25,11) would go to (26,12), which is the rat's location. But the language observation says ""giant rat adjacent southeast"", so that direction should be possible. However, earlier when the agent tried to move southeast, the message was ""It's a wall."" That might be a mistake, or perhaps there's a wall blocking that path.

Wait, maybe the map display is misleading. The map shows horizontal walls near north and south, and vertical walls near west and east. The agent is at (25,11). Moving southeast to (26,12) would be into the rat's position. If there's no wall there, the agent should be able to move and attack. But the previous attempt resulted in a wall message. Maybe the issue is that the rat is blocking the path, and in MiniHack, enemies can block movement unless the agent has the 'phase door' or can pick locks, which the agent doesn't have here. So the agent can't move into the rat's tile directly.

In that case, the agent needs to either attack from a distance or find a way around the rat. Since the inventory has a long sword, which is a melee weapon, the agent needs to be adjacent to the rat to attack. But if the rat is blocking the path, the agent can't move into its space. So the alternative is to attack while remaining adjacent. But how?

Wait, in some games, attacking can be done without moving, but MiniHack might require moving into the adjacent tile to attack. Since that's not possible here, perhaps the agent needs to find a different route to get around the rat and reach the stairs. The stairs are adjacent to the southwest, which is at (24,11). The agent is at (25,11). So moving west once would get to (24,11), where the stairs are. But the problem is the rat is blocking the path. If the agent can move west around the rat, but the rat is at (26,12), which is southeast of the agent's current position. So the agent is at (25,11), stairs at (24,11). To get to the stairs, the agent needs to go west, but the rat is in the way. Maybe the agent can move north, then west, then south to bypass the rat.

Looking at the current map:

At (25,11), moving north to (25,10). The language observation says horizontal wall near north, so maybe moving north is into a wall. The stairs are southsouthwest, which would be (23,10) perhaps. But the agent is at (25,11). The stairs are adjacent southwest, which is (24,11). So the agent needs to get from (25,11) to (24,11). The direct path is blocked by the rat. So possible moves: west to (24,11) where the stairs are, but can't move there because the rat is at (26,12), which is southeast. Wait, maybe the rat is not in the way of moving west. The agent is at (25,11), moving west to (24,11) would reach the stairs. But is there a wall there? The language observation says horizontal wall adjacent south and southwest. The stairs are adjacent southwest, which is (24,11). So if the stairs are there, then moving west from (25,11) to (24,11) should be possible, arriving at the stairs. But earlier attempts to move west resulted in a wall? Wait, in the previous observation, after moving west, the agent was back at (24,13), which was a wall? No, looking back, when the agent moved west from (25,13) to (24,13), the message was ""It's a wall."" But now the agent is at (25,11), and the stairs are adjacent southwest. So moving west from (25,11) would go to (24,11), which is the stairs. But is there a wall there?

The language observation says ""horizontal wall adjacent south and southwest"". The agent is at (25,11). The horizontal wall adjacent south would be at (25,12), which is the agent's current row. The stairs are southwest of the agent, which is (24,11). So moving west to (24,11) should be possible, as that's where the stairs are. So the correct action here is to move west to reach the stairs down. But why wasn't that working before? Maybe there was a misunderstanding in the map layout.

Alternatively, perhaps the stairs are not directly at (24,11) but somewhere else. The map shows the agent's position as |..@| in the row y=12, and the stairs up adjacent southwest. The stairs up would be in a separate tile. So maybe the agent needs to move southwest to reach the stairs. But the directions are a bit confusing. The language observation says ""stairs up adjacent southwest"", so moving southwest from (25,11) would take them to (24,10), which is the stairs. But is that a valid move? The vertical wall near west is at (24,11), so moving southwest from (25,11) to (24,10) might be possible if there's no wall there.

Alternatively, the agent could try to circle around the rat. Since the rat is at (26,12), the agent could move north to (25,10), then west to (24,10), then south to (24,11) where the stairs are. But moving north from (25,11) might be into a wall, as per the language observation saying horizontal wall near north.

This is getting a bit complicated. The priority is to reach the stairs down. The stairs are adjacent southwest, so the best bet is to move southwest. But need to check if that's possible. The agent's current position is (25,11). Moving southwest would go to (24,10). Is there a wall there? The language observation mentions horizontal walls near north and south, vertical walls near west. The vertical wall near west is at x=24, so moving west from (25,11) to (24,11) might be blocked by the vertical wall. But the stairs are adjacent southwest, which is (24,11), so perhaps moving west is the way to go.

Wait, maybe the stairs are at (24,11), which is west of the agent. So moving west once would reach the stairs. But earlier attempts to move west resulted in a wall. Let me check the previous observations. When the agent was at (25,13) and moved west, they hit a wall. But now they're at (25,11), so moving west to (24,11) might be different. The vertical wall near west is at x=24, but adjacent west of the agent's current position (x=25) would be x=24, which is where the stairs are. So perhaps moving west is possible here.

In that case, the correct action is to move west to reach the stairs down. Alternatively, if moving west is blocked, the agent needs to find another path. But according to the current language observation, the stairs are adjacent southwest, which is west from the agent's position. So moving west should work. The previous issue might have been due to a different position. Therefore, the best action now is to move west.

Let's see where I am. I'm trying to reach the stairs down in MiniHack. The latest observation shows I'm at position (24, 11). The stairs up are very near the south, so maybe moving south could get me to them. But there's also a giant rat adjacent to the east (position (25,11)), which has been biting me a lot.

First, I need to get rid of the giant rat to avoid damage. My inventory has a +1 long sword as the main weapon and a +1 lance as an alternate. Plus, I have some food like apples and carrots. Attacking the rat is probably the priority here. But how?

I tried attacking with 'attack-east' before, but the system said it's an invalid action. Maybe I need to use the correct format. In the game, attacking directions are usually done with 'attack' followed by the direction, like 'attack east'. Let me check the valid actions again. The possible actions include moving in various directions and attacking in those directions. So 'attack east' should be valid.

Looking at the current map, the rat is to the east. If I attack it, I can deal damage. My strength is 14, so each hit might do 1d10 damage. With the +1 sword, maybe around 6 on average. The rat's HP isn't shown here, but it's been biting me multiple times, so it's probably around 10-15 HP. If I keep attacking, I should be able to kill it.

Once the rat is dead, I can move south to the stairs. But I need to make sure I'm not taking too much damage. Alternatively, using the lance might be better for ranged attacks, but I'm not wielding it. Switching weapons might help. So maybe first, switch to the lance with 'equip b' (since the lance is item b), then attack from a distance. But switching weapons takes an action, and I need to check if that's efficient.

Alternatively, keep attacking with the sword. Let me try 'attack east' again. If that's allowed, then repeat attacking until the rat is gone. Then move south to the stairs. The stairs up are adjacent south, so moving south once should reach them. Wait, but in the current observation, the stairs up are very near south. So moving south once would get me there. But I need to confirm the map layout.

Looking at the map, the agent is at |.@r| on line 2, position 24. The stairs up are south of that. So moving south from (24,11) would take me to (24,12), which is the stairs. But wait, the latest cursor position is (24,11), and the stairs up are very near south. So moving south once should reach the stairs. However, there's a giant rat blocking the east. So I need to eliminate it first.

Therefore, the plan is: attack the rat to the east until it's dead, then move south to the stairs. Since attacking east is the valid action here, I'll keep choosing 'attack east' until the rat is defeated. Once that's done, move south.

53,attack-east,"<reasoning>
The agent is trying to reach the stairs down in MiniHack. The current problem is dealing with a giant rat blocking the path. The previous attempts to attack using 'attack-east' weren't valid, so the system defaulted to moving north each time. The agent is at (24, 11) with the rat adjacent to the east.

First, I need to figure out how to attack the rat properly. In MiniHack, attacking usually requires using a weapon, and the command should specify the direction. The valid attack commands are like 'attack-east' or 'attack-rat' if the monster is in sight. Since the rat is adjacent east, 'attack-east' should work once the action is valid.

Looking at the inventory, the agent has a +1 long sword equipped. So, attacking with the sword in the east direction should deal damage. The previous error was due to incorrect formatting, maybe a typo. The correct action should be 'attack-east' again, ensuring proper syntax.

The agent needs to stay in position to attack the rat repeatedly until it's defeated. Once the rat is gone, the path to the stairs (which is south of the current position at (24,11)) should be clear. So the next steps are: attack the rat from the east, then move south to the stairs.

Since the last valid move was 'north' due to invalid action, the agent is now back at (24,11). The priority is to eliminate the rat. Using 'attack-east' should work now. After defeating the rat, moving south will reach the stairs down.

54,east,"<reasoning>
Let's try to figure out what to do here. The agent is stuck in this MiniHack environment, trying to explore the level and reach the stairs down. Let's look at the current situation based on the latest observations.

First, the agent's position is (24, 11). The stairs up are very near the south, so moving south might lead towards them. However, there's a giant rat adjacent to the east. The agent has tried attacking east before, but it resulted in a syntax error because the action wasn't valid. Instead, the default action was north, which didn't help. 

The inventory shows the agent has a +1 long sword and a +1 lance. Maybe switching weapons could help in attacking the rat more effectively. The current weapon is the sword, but wielding the lance might make attacks hit more often. 

The language observation mentions a horizontal wall near the south and vertical walls around the east, southeast, southwest, and west. So the agent is probably in a corridor or a room with walls on those sides. The giant rat is to the east, and the stairs up are south. 

The agent needs to get past the rat to reach the stairs. Since attacking east directly isn't working due to possible syntax issues, perhaps moving closer to the rat and then attacking with the lance would be better. Let's check the possible movements. The agent is at (24,11). The rat is adjacent east, so moving east to (25,11) would put the agent next to the rat, allowing for an attack. Then, using the lance (action 'attack-east' again but after positioning) could work. Alternatively, maybe the agent should switch weapons first to have a better chance of hitting.

So the plan is: move east once to get next to the rat, then attack with the lance. But since previous 'attack-east' commands didn't work, maybe the correct syntax is 'attack east' or just 'attack' with a direction specified. Wait, the available actions are listed as north, east, south, west, etc., but attacking isn't listed. Wait, the problem statement lists only movement directions. So how does attacking work in this game? Maybe attacking is a separate action, perhaps triggered by moving towards the enemy. But in the user's initial list, the possible actions are only movement directions. That complicates things. The agent can't directly attack; maybe attacking is implied when moving into a direction with an enemy. Alternatively, maybe the 'attack' command is part of the action list but wasn't mentioned. But according to the problem statement, the possible actions are the movement directions. 

Wait, the initial message from the user lists the possible actions as movement directions only. So attacking isn't a separate action. Then, how does the agent attack? Perhaps by moving into the adjacent tile of the enemy, which would trigger an attack. So in this case, moving east to (25,11) where the rat is, and then the attack is automatically triggered. But in previous attempts, moving east didn't result in an attack message. Maybe the agent needs to be wielding the right weapon. Let's check the inventory again. The agent has a +1 long sword in hand and a +1 lance as an alternate. Switching to the lance might increase the chance of hitting. 

So the steps could be: wield lance (if that's a possible action), then move east towards the rat. But the problem is that the listed actions don't include wielding or using items. The available actions are only movement. Therefore, the agent can't directly switch weapons. In that case, maybe the agent should just keep moving towards the rat and attacking by proximity. 

Wait, the previous attempts to 'attack-east' resulted in syntax errors. The correct way to attack might be to move in the direction of the enemy. For example, moving east into the rat's tile would trigger an attack. Let's try that. The agent is at (24,11), the rat is at (25,11). So moving east would take the agent next to the rat, and perhaps that would result in an attack. Let's test that. 

Also, the agent's health is 9 after several bites. Getting past the rat is crucial to avoid losing more HP. The stairs down are the goal, but they're south near the stairs up. So after dealing with the rat, moving south towards the stairs would be the next step. 

Another thing to note: the agent tried moving southwest twice and got a 'It's a wall' message, indicating that path is blocked. The same with moving west into a vertical wall. So available directions are north, east, south, and possibly northeast or southeast, but need to check the map. 

Looking at the map, the current view shows a room with walls on the north, south, east, west, and some corners. The agent is in the center perhaps. The stairs up are to the southwest. The rat is to the east. 

So the plan is: move east once to reach the rat, triggering an attack. If that doesn't work, maybe move diagonally? But the allowed actions are only cardinal directions. Alternatively, keep attacking by moving east each turn, but the agent's previous attempts resulted in syntax issues. 

Wait, in the earlier steps, when the user tried 'attack-east', it didn't work because the action wasn't valid. The correct action might be to move east, which would put the agent next to the rat and automatically attack. Let's try that. So the next action should be 'east' to move towards the rat. 

Once the agent is next to the rat, moving east again might trigger another attack. Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to wield the lance first. But since there's no action to wield, perhaps the agent has to rely on the current weapon. 

So the chosen action is 'east' to move closer to the rat and trigger an attack.

55,south,"<reasoning>
The current situation is that I just killed the giant rat. Now, the main goal is to explore the level and reach the stairs down. Let's look at the observations.

The language observation mentions stairs up are very near southsouthwest. But the goal is to reach the stairs down, right? Wait, maybe the stairs up are a distraction. Let me check the map again. 

Looking at the cursor position: (24,11). The map shows that there's a stairs up indicator very near southsouthwest. But stairs down would be the way to proceed to deeper levels. However, in the current observation, the stairs up is highlighted, but maybe there are stairs down elsewhere. 

The map provided has some horizontal walls and corners. The agent is at (24,11). The stairs up is southsouthwest, which would be moving more south and west. But perhaps there's a different path. The giant rat is now a corpse, so that's no longer a threat. 

The language observation also mentions a vertical wall very near east, southeast, southwest, and west. So movement to the east is blocked by a wall. The stairs up is south, so maybe moving south towards the stairs up is an option, but since the goal is stairs down, perhaps that's not the way. 

Wait, maybe I missed something. Let me check the map again. The map shows the agent's position with '@' at (24,11). The stairs up is in the southwest direction. But maybe there's a different path. The agent needs to explore the area. 

Since the giant rat is dead, maybe the agent should proceed towards the stairs up, but that's the opposite of the goal. Wait, no, the stairs up would take you back to a previous level, but the goal here is to reach the stairs down to go deeper. So perhaps I need to explore other directions. 

Looking at the map, there's a horizontal wall adjacent to north, northeast, and northwest. So moving north is blocked. The vertical walls to the east, southeast, etc., block movement there. The agent is at (24,11). The stairs up is southwest, so moving southwest might lead to the stairs up, but that's not helpful. 

Alternatively, maybe moving south or west could reveal a path to stairs down. Let's think. The agent was previously moving in various directions, trying to avoid walls. Since the giant rat is dead, perhaps the agent can now move more freely. 

Looking at the cursor's position and the walls, maybe moving south into the area where the stairs up is located isn't the way. Alternatively, moving west might be possible. The vertical wall is very near west, but maybe there's a passage beyond that. 

Wait, the vertical wall is very near west, so moving west from (24,11) would hit the wall. But perhaps moving southwest or other diagonal directions could lead away from the wall. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent should check the area near the stairs up. Since the stairs up is southwest, moving southwest from (24,11) would take the agent to (23,12) perhaps? Let me check the coordinates. 

If the agent is at (24,11), moving southwest would decrease both x and y by 1, so (23,10). But the language observation says stairs up are very near southwest. So maybe the agent needs to approach that area. 

But the goal is stairs down. Maybe the stairs down are in a different location. The agent needs to explore more. 

Looking at the possible actions, the agent can move in eight directions. Since movement to east is blocked by a wall, the agent should try other directions. 

Perhaps moving south from (24,11) to (24,12). Check if that's passable. The horizontal wall adjacent north, northeast, and northwest. The agent is currently north of that wall. Moving south would take them into the area where the horizontal wall is, but maybe there's a passage. 

Alternatively, moving west is blocked by a vertical wall. So the options are south, southwest, southeast, or maybe northwest. 

Wait, the agent's current position is (24,11). The stairs up are southwest. So moving southwest might lead closer to the stairs up, but again, that's not the goal. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent should move in a diagonal direction that's not blocked. For example, moving southwest might be blocked by the vertical wall, but moving southeast could be possible if there's no wall there. 

Looking at the language observation: vertical wall very near east, southeast, southwest, and west. So moving southeast from (24,11) would be to (25,12), which is adjacent to the vertical wall. 

Hmm. This is getting a bit confusing. Maybe the agent should try to move towards the stairs up first to see if there's any information there, but the priority is to reach the stairs down. 

Alternatively, perhaps the agent should check the area north of the horizontal wall. Since the horizontal wall is adjacent north, moving north is blocked. 

Wait, the agent's current position is (24,11). The horizontal wall is adjacent north, so moving north would hit the wall. The agent needs to explore south or other directions. 

Another approach: Since the agent killed the giant rat, maybe the area is now safer to explore. The agent should move in a direction that's not blocked by walls and look for the stairs down. 

Looking at the map, the agent is in a room with walls around. The stairs up are in the southwest corner. Maybe the agent should move towards the center of the room to see if there are other exits. 

Alternatively, the agent could move south to (24,12) and check what's there. Since the horizontal wall is adjacent north, moving south would take the agent into an area beyond the wall, but the language observation doesn't mention walls there. 

Wait, the language observation says horizontal wall adjacent north and northwest. So moving south from (24,11) would be into an area where there's no horizontal wall mentioned. Maybe that's a passage. 

So, the best action here would be to move south to explore beyond the horizontal wall and possibly find a path leading to the stairs down. Alternatively, moving southwest towards the stairs up, but that's not the goal. 

Given that the goal is to reach the stairs down, and the current observations don't indicate their location, the agent should continue exploring. Moving south seems like a safe bet to proceed further into the level.

Let's see. The goal here is to reach the stairs down. The previous steps involved fighting a giant rat. Now that the rat is dead, I need to figure out the next move.

Looking at the current position, the cursor is at (24, 12). The stairs up are adjacent to the south. Wait, the stairs up are mentioned in the language observation as adjacent south, so that's probably where I need to go. But the message says ""stairs up adjacent south,"" so moving south would take me to the stairs up? Wait, but the goal is to reach the stairs down. Maybe there's a typo here. Let me check again.

Wait, the game's message might be a bit confusing. The stairs down are the target, but in the current observation, it says ""stairs up adjacent south."" So maybe the stairs up are here, and to get downstairs, I need to go down from another location. Hmm, perhaps this is a different layout. Wait, maybe I'm on the first level, and the stairs down are elsewhere.

Looking at the map, the stairs up are very near southsouthwest. Wait, in the latest observation, the stairs up are adjacent south. So moving south from (24,12) would take me to where the stairs up are. But since the goal is to reach the stairs down, maybe I need to go to another part of the level where the stairs down are located. Hmm, perhaps I need to explore more first.

Wait, the agent's current position is (24,12), and the stairs up are adjacent south. So moving south would take me to the stairs up. But I need to go downstairs. Maybe the stairs down are elsewhere in the level. The initial problem was to explore and reach the stairs down, so perhaps I need to move around to find where the stairs down are located.

Looking at the map structure, there are walls and open areas. The agent is in a room with walls around, and the stairs up are to the south. But maybe the stairs down are in another part of the dungeon. Since I've killed the rat, perhaps I can now proceed to explore further.

The language observation mentions a dark area far east and vertical walls near west. So maybe moving east could lead to more exploration. Alternatively, since the stairs up are south, maybe moving south first to see where they lead. But the goal is the stairs down, not up. So perhaps moving in a different direction would be better.

Alternatively, maybe the stairs down are in the same room but in a different location. The map shows some horizontal and vertical walls. Let me try to visualize the map. The agent is in a room with walls on the north, south, east, and west. The stairs up are south, so moving south would take them out of the room into another area where maybe the stairs down are.

Wait, perhaps the stairs down are in another part of the level that hasn't been explored yet. The agent has been moving around, fighting the rat, and now needs to proceed. Let me check the previous movements.

The agent started at (26,12), moved southwest multiple times, encountered the rat, fought it, and ended up at (24,11) after killing the rat. Then moved south to (24,12). Now the stairs up are adjacent south. So moving south from (24,12) would be to (24,13), but according to the map, the stairs up are very near southsouthwest. Maybe the stairs down are elsewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the agent needs to explore other directions. The dark area is far east, so moving east might reveal more of the level. But there's a vertical wall near west, so moving west might hit a wall. The agent could try moving northeast or southeast to see if there are passages.

Wait, the language observation mentions a vertical wall very near east, southeast, southwest, and west. So the current room is surrounded by walls on all sides except maybe south. The stairs up are south, so moving south would exit the room. Then perhaps in that new area, there are stairs down.

But since the goal is to reach the stairs down, perhaps the agent should move south to the stairs up first, then go down from there. But that seems counterintuitive. Usually, stairs up lead to higher levels, and stairs down to lower ones. So moving south to the stairs up, then taking them down would reach the next level. But the problem statement says to reach the stairs down, which might be on the same level or another. Need to confirm.

Alternatively, maybe the stairs down are in this room but not yet discovered. The map shows some '.' which might be walkable spaces. Let me check the map again. In the current map view, the agent is at (24,12), and the stairs up are adjacent south. The map's visualization shows the agent's position with '@', and the stairs up with '>'. But in the provided map, it's unclear. The user's map might have placeholders.

Given the information, the safest bet is to move towards the stairs up, assuming that taking them down would lead to the next level where the actual stairs down are. Alternatively, explore other directions to find where the stairs down are located. Since the agent has already fought the rat, maybe proceeding south to the stairs up and then moving down from there would be the way to go.

Therefore, the next action should be to move south towards the stairs up, which are adjacent. Once there, perhaps the agent can go down, but according to the problem statement, the goal is to reach the stairs down. So moving south to the stairs up and then taking them down would be the logical step. However, in the current observation, the stairs up are adjacent south, so moving south would take the agent to the stairs up. Then, the action would be to move south again to reach them, and then perhaps 'down' to go to the next level. But since the agent is supposed to reach the stairs down, maybe the stairs down are on that next level.

Alternatively, perhaps the stairs down are in this room but masked by the rat's presence. But since the rat is dead, maybe the path is clear. However, based on the latest map, there's a giant rat corpse adjacent northeast and the stairs up adjacent south. So moving south seems like the correct direction. 

Therefore, the next action should be to move south to reach the stairs up, and then proceed down from there. But the user's current observation shows that the stairs up are adjacent south, so moving south would take the agent there. Once there, the agent can then take the stairs down. However, the problem states to reach the stairs down, so perhaps the agent should move towards them directly. 

Alternatively, maybe the stairs down are in another part of the level. The agent has to explore further. Since the dark area is far east, moving east could lead to new areas. But there's a vertical wall near east, so moving east might not be possible. The agent could try moving northeast or southeast, but the language observation mentions vertical walls adjacent northeast and southeast. 

Wait, in the current language observation, vertical walls are adjacent northeast and southeast. So moving northeast or southeast would hit walls. The only open directions might be south and maybe west. But west has a vertical wall very near. So the only viable direction is south. 

Therefore, the agent should move south to the stairs up, then perhaps proceed down. But according to the problem statement, the goal is to reach the stairs down, so moving south to the stairs up and then taking them down would be the way to go. However, the user's map might have the stairs down in another location. 

Given the available information, the best course of action is to move south towards the stairs up, assuming that taking them down will lead to the desired level where the stairs down are located. Therefore, the next action is to move south.

Let's see where I am. The goal is to reach the stairs down. The map shows stairs up are to the west, and stairs down are probably somewhere else. The last observation says I'm at (24,13). The stairs up are adjacent west, but I need to go down.

Looking at the current map, there's a giant rat corpse to the northnortheast and a giant rat adjacent northeast. I just killed the giant rat, so that's no longer a threat. The vertical walls are to the northeast, east, west, and northwest, which means movement in those directions is blocked by walls.

The horizontal walls are adjacent to southeast, south, and southwest. So moving south might be possible. The cursor's position is (24,13), and the stairs up are west, but I need to go down. Maybe the stairs down are in another part of the room. Let me check the language observations again.

The message says ""The giant rat misses!"" and the language observations mention a horizontal wall near north, vertical walls in the northeast, east, west, northwest, and a giant rat adjacent northeast. The horizontal walls in the southeast, south, and southwest are adjacent. So moving south might lead me away from the walls.

Since the stairs down are likely not in the immediate area, I need to explore. The only open direction seems to be south. Let me check the map again. The map shows a grid with some hyphens and pipes, but the exact layout isn't clear. The cursor's position is (24,13), and moving south would take me to (24,14). The horizontal wall is adjacent to south and southwest, so maybe moving south is possible.

Alternatively, maybe there's a corridor or another room south. Since the vertical walls block east, northeast, west, northwest, and the horizontal walls are in the south, southwest, southeast, perhaps moving southwest could be an option, but the horizontal wall adjacent to southwest would block that. So the best bet is to move south to explore further.

The agent is in a MiniHack game, trying to reach the stairs down. The goal is to explore the level and find the stairs. Let's look at the current state.

The agent's position is (24,13). The map shows walls around, with a giant rat corpse to the northeast and the live rat adjacent northeast. The stairs up are south, but the last move south hit a wall. The inventory has a +1 long sword, so attacking is possible. However, the rat is nearby, and attacking it again might be necessary before moving.

The message says ""It's a wall"" when the agent tried moving south. So moving south again won't work. The stairs up are south, but there's a wall blocking that path. So the agent needs to find another way to reach the stairs. Maybe move west or east to get around the wall?

Looking at the language observations: vertical walls are very near northeast, east, west, northwest. The horizontal walls are adjacent to south, southeast, southwest. The stairs up are adjacent south, but blocked by a wall. So perhaps the agent needs to move west or east to find a path to the stairs.

Alternatively, attack the remaining rat to eliminate it, then search for another way. The agent has a good weapon (long sword +1). If the rat is adjacent, attacking east or northeast could work. But previous attempts to attack east resulted in defaulting to north because of invalid actions. Maybe need to ensure the action is correctly formatted.

Wait, the valid actions are the ones listed at the beginning: north, east, south, west, etc. So ""attack-east"" is not a valid action; instead, the correct action would be to use the attack command with the direction. But in MiniHack, the attack action is typically a single direction, like ""attack-east"" might not be valid. The correct way is to move towards the enemy and attack, but maybe the system expects the agent to use the attack action in the direction. Alternatively, the attack is part of the movement. Wait, in some games, you have to face the direction before attacking. But given the history, the user tried ""attack-east"" and it defaulted to north, indicating that might not be a valid action. So perhaps the valid actions are only movement directions, and attacking is done by moving into the enemy's tile. Let me check previous interactions.

Earlier, the user tried ""attack-east"" but it defaulted to north. So the correct approach is to move adjacent to the enemy and then attack, but maybe the attack is implicit when moving into the enemy's square. Alternatively, the game might have a separate attack command. But based on the defaulting to north, it seems that attack commands are not valid, so the agent must move towards the enemy and then either attack by moving into them or use a different action.

In this case, the agent is at (24,13), and the rat is at (25,13). To attack, the agent needs to be adjacent. The agent is west of the rat. So moving east once would put the agent adjacent to the rat. Then, perhaps attacking by moving into it. Alternatively, the game might allow attacking from adjacent tiles without needing to move into them. But since previous attacks didn't work when using ""attack-east"", the agent has to move into the rat's tile.

So the plan is: move east to (25,13), which is where the rat is. Then, the attack would happen automatically upon entering the tile. That way, the agent can kill the rat and then proceed.

But looking at the map, the agent is at (24,13), and the rat is adjacent east. So moving east would take the agent to (25,13), the rat's current position. Entering that tile would result in an attack, killing the rat. Once the rat is dead, the agent can check for the stairs up, which are south, but blocked by a wall. So maybe the stairs are elsewhere?

Alternatively, after killing the rat, the agent should explore other directions. The vertical walls are very near east, north, west, northwest. The horizontal walls are adjacent south, southeast, southwest. So moving south from (24,13) is a wall, but maybe moving west or east could lead to a passage.

Wait, the stairs up are adjacent south, but it's a wall. So the stairs must be elsewhere. The agent needs to find another path. Let's look at the map again. The map shows a room with walls around. The agent is in a part of the room. Maybe moving west from (24,13) could lead to a passage.

If the agent moves west to (23,13), what's there? The vertical wall is very near west, so that might be a wall. Alternatively, the horizontal walls adjacent south, southeast, southwest. So moving west might hit a wall. Alternatively, moving northwest or southwest.

Wait, the language observation mentions vertical wall very near west. So moving west from (24,13) would hit a wall. So the agent can't go west. How about southwest? The horizontal walls adjacent south and southwest. So moving southwest from (24,13) would be to (23,12), which is adjacent to a horizontal wall. Maybe that's a passage?

Alternatively, the agent could try moving north. The horizontal wall is near north, so moving north from (24,13) would hit a wall. So the only possible movements are east, southeast, or maybe south, but that's a wall. Wait, the current position is (24,13). The stairs up are adjacent south, but it's a wall. So the agent needs to find another way.

After killing the rat, the agent should check other directions. Maybe move east once, attack, then move further. Wait, but the agent is already at (24,13), east is the rat's position. Moving east would enter the rat's tile, killing it. Then, the agent is at (25,13), with the corpse. Then, what's around there? The map shows horizontal walls adjacent south, southeast, southwest. So moving south from (25,13) would be a wall. Moving east would be a vertical wall. So perhaps the agent needs to move west back to (24,13), then try another direction.

Alternatively, after killing the rat, the agent should look for the stairs down. But the problem states the goal is to reach the stairs down, not the stairs up. The initial message mentions reaching the stairs down. So the agent needs to find the stairs down, which might be located elsewhere in the level.

Given that the stairs up are present but blocked, the agent needs to explore other areas. The map shows a dark area very near northeast. Maybe moving northeast could lead to a new area. Or check the other directions.

Alternatively, the agent could move northwest from (24,13) to (23,12), but the horizontal wall is adjacent southwest, so that might be a wall. Alternatively, move southeast to (25,12), but there's a horizontal wall adjacent southeast. Hmm.

Wait, the language observation says horizontal wall very near north. So moving north from (24,13) is a wall. Vertical wall very near east, so moving east beyond the rat's position is a wall. South is a wall. West is a wall. So the agent is surrounded by walls except for the rat's position. But that can't be right. Maybe the map interpretation is off.

Looking at the map provided:

The map shows:

                      -----                                      
                      |..%|                                      
                      |..r.###                                                  
                      |.@.|                                                     
                      -----                                                     

This seems to represent a 5x5 grid (since ----- is 5 dashes). The agent is at |.@.|, which is the fourth row (y=13). The rat is at |..r.|, which is the third row (y=12), third column (x=25). The stairs up are adjacent south, which would be below the agent's current position, but it's a wall.

Given that the agent is surrounded by walls on most sides, but there's a rat to the east, the only way out is to defeat the rat and then find another path. However, since all directions except east lead to walls, perhaps the agent needs to move east into the rat, kill it, then check again.

But the agent is already trying to attack the rat, but previous attempts resulted in default actions. The correct approach is to move east once to be adjacent, then possibly attack. But in the game, attacking might be a separate action, or moving into the enemy's tile automatically deals damage.

Given the previous observations, when the agent moved east to (25,12) and then tried to attack east, it defaulted to north. So maybe the attack command isn't valid, and the agent must move into the enemy's tile to attack.

So the next step is to move east to (25,13), where the rat is. That should kill the rat. Then, the agent can check for other paths. After killing the rat, the language observation shows the giant rat corpse adjacent east, so the agent is now next to the corpse. The stairs up are still south, but it's a wall. The other directions: north is a wall, west is a vertical wall, east is the corpse, south is a wall. So the agent is trapped?

That can't be right. There must be a way out. Maybe the stairs down are in another part of the level, and the agent needs to explore further. But given the current map, it's unclear. Perhaps the agent needs to move in a different direction, but all primary directions are blocked.

Alternatively, the agent should check for other features. The dark area very near northeast. Moving northeast from (24,13) would be to (25,12), which is adjacent to a horizontal wall. Not helpful. The southeast corner is adjacent southeast, which might be a wall.

Wait, the language observation mentions vertical wall very near northeast, east, west, and northwest. So moving northeast from (24,13) would be to (25,12), which is adjacent to a vertical wall. So that's a wall.

Given that all movement directions are blocked except east (which leads to the corpse), the agent is stuck. But that's unlikely. Maybe there's a bug in the map interpretation or the observations.

Alternatively, perhaps the agent needs to pick up the stairs, but the stairs up are present but blocked. The goal is to reach the stairs down, which might be located elsewhere. The agent needs to explore more of the level, but how?

In the current state, the agent is surrounded by walls and the only enemy is dead. The only possible action is to move east to the corpse, but that's already there. Maybe the agent needs to move in a diagonal direction, but the allowed actions are only the eight cardinal directions.

Wait, the allowed actions include northeast, southeast, etc. So maybe moving northeast from (24,13) to (25,12). But the language observation says vertical wall very near northeast, so that's a wall. So moving northeast would hit a wall.

The same for other diagonal directions. So the agent is stuck in a room with all walls around except for the dead rat. But that can't be the case. There must be a mistake in the map interpretation.

Alternatively, the stairs down are in another part of the level, and the agent needs to find a way out of this room. But based on the current observations, it's unclear. Perhaps the agent needs to move back west to explore other areas, but west is a vertical wall.

This is confusing. Maybe the agent should try moving southwest, even though the horizontal wall is adjacent. Let's see: moving southwest from (24,13) would be to (23,12). The horizontal wall is adjacent south and southwest, so that tile might be passable. Wait, the horizontal wall adjacent south means that the cell to the south of the agent is a wall. So moving south from (24,13) is a wall, but moving southwest would be to (23,12), which is adjacent to the horizontal wall southwest. So that cell might be a wall as well.

Given all this, the agent might be trapped. However, the goal is to reach the stairs down, which suggests there must be a way. Perhaps the initial observations were incorrect, or the agent needs to pick up the stairs, but they're not in the current room.

Alternatively, the agent should pick up the stairs if they're present, but the current observations don't indicate stairs down. The only stairs mentioned are stairs up adjacent south, which is a wall.

In this case, the agent might need to backtrack. But how? All primary directions are blocked. The only option is to move east to the corpse and then perhaps move in another direction, but it's unclear.

Wait, the inventory has a +1 long sword. Maybe using a different weapon, but the agent is wielding the long sword. Perhaps the agent needs to use a different action, like picking up items or using a potion. But the current goal is to reach the stairs down, not to collect items.

Another possibility: the stairs down are in the same room but masked by the wall. Maybe the agent needs to dig or kick the wall. But the allowed actions don't include digging, unless it's a specific command. The available actions are movement only.

Given the constraints, the best possible action is to move east to the corpse and then try to find another way. But since all other directions are walls, the agent might be stuck. However, the problem states that the goal is to reach the stairs down, so there must be a way.

Perhaps the agent needs to move in a different pattern. For example, moving northwest, even though it's a wall, but maybe there's a passage. Alternatively, the agent should try moving in a spiral to explore adjacent rooms.

But given the current observations, the agent is surrounded by walls. The only way forward is to defeat the rat and then look for the stairs down elsewhere. Since the rat is dead, the agent should now search for the stairs.

Wait, the message after killing the rat doesn't mention stairs. The agent's goal is to reach the stairs down, which might be in another part of the level. The current room might be a corridor leading to the stairs.

Alternatively, the agent needs to move back to the previous room. But how? The only way out is through the walls, which isn't possible.

This is perplexing. Given the available information, the agent should try to move in a direction that wasn't previously blocked. For example, moving southwest from (24,13) to (23,12), even though the horizontal wall is adjacent. Maybe that tile is passable.

Alternatively, the agent can try moving south again, hoping it's not a wall. But the observation says it's a wall. So that's not possible.

Given all this, the most logical action is to move east to the corpse and then perhaps move west back to explore other areas, but west is a wall. Alternatively, move in a diagonal direction that wasn't previously tried.

Wait, the allowed actions include northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest. The agent is at (24,13). Moving southwest would be to (23,12). The horizontal wall is adjacent south and southwest. So that tile (23,12) is adjacent to the horizontal wall southwest, meaning it's a wall. So moving southwest is impossible.

The same applies to other diagonal directions. Thus, the agent is truly stuck in a room with all walls around and the only exit is through the stairs down, which isn't visible.

This suggests that there's a bug in the game or the observations are incorrect. However, assuming the observations are correct, the agent must find another way.

Wait, the initial problem states that the goal is to reach the stairs down. The stairs up are present but blocked. Perhaps the agent needs to find another set of stairs down in a different part of the level. To do that, the agent must explore beyond the current room.

But given the current map, the agent is in a 5x5 room with walls around. The only way to explore is to move through the walls, which isn't possible. This indicates that the agent needs to pick a different path earlier.

Looking back at the history, the agent initially moved southwest, then west, then northeast, etc. Perhaps there's a way to exit the room through a different direction that wasn't explored yet.

Wait, the initial map when the agent started showed a different layout. Let me check the first map observation:

First map after starting:

                      -----                                                     
                      |...|                                                     
                      |...r###                                                  
                      |.<@|                                                     
                      -----                                                     

The agent was at (25,13), with the rat adjacent northeast. After moving west, the agent was at (24,13), and the rat was at (25,13). Then moving east killed the rat, bringing the agent to (25,13) with the corpse.

Now, the agent is at (24,13) again after moving west. The rat is dead, and the agent is surrounded by walls. The only possible action is to move east again to the corpse, but that doesn't help.

Perhaps the agent needs to move in a different pattern. For example, move north, even though it's a wall, to see if there's a passage beyond. But the observation says it's a wall.

Alternatively, the agent should try to move in a spiral, exploring all directions. But given the current layout, it's impossible.

Given the constraints, the best action is to move east to the corpse and then try to find a way out. However, since all other directions are walls, the agent might be stuck. But the problem requires reaching the stairs down, so there must be a way.

Wait, the language observation mentions ""dark area very near southeast"". Maybe moving southeast could reveal a passage. The agent is at (24,13). Moving southeast would be to (25,12). The vertical wall is very near east, so that tile might be a wall. But the dark area is very near southeast, which could be a different tile.

Alternatively, the agent should pick up any items, but the inventory is mostly food and armor. The stairs down must be somewhere else.

Considering all this, the only possible valid action that hasn't been tried extensively is to move in a diagonal direction, even if it's supposed to be a wall, to see if there's a passage. For example, moving northeast from (24,13) to (25,12). The language observation says vertical wall very near northeast, but maybe that's a different tile.

Alternatively, the agent should move southwest again, even though it's a wall, to see if the wall is passable. But according to the observations, it's a wall.

In conclusion, given the current state and the observations, the best action is to move east to the giant rat's corpse, as that's the only nearby movable direction, and perhaps then re-evaluate.

Let's see. I need to get to the stairs down. Since the stairs up are southwest, but the current goal is stairs down, which I haven't found yet. Looking at the map, the last observation shows that the stairs up are adjacent to the southwest. But the stairs down might be somewhere else, maybe in a different part of the level. The agent is currently at (25,13). Let me check the language observations again.

The current message is ""The giant rat bites!"" and the giant rat is adjacent north. So it's still there, but I killed the previous one. Wait, the corpse is north of here, and the live rat is north. But in the last move, the agent moved east to (25,13), and now the rat is north. The map shows the agent as @ in the center of the room, with the rat to the north. The stairs up are southwest, but stairs down would probably be in another part of the dungeon. Since the agent is on level 1, stairs down would take them to level 2.

Looking at the walls: there's a horizontal wall near north, vertical wall near west, and the agent is next to a vertical wall on the east? Wait, the language observation says vertical wall adjacent east. So the agent is up against a wall to the east. That means moving east isn't possible. The possible moves might be north, west, south, or diagonals, but the walls might block some paths.

The agent killed the rat to the north, so maybe moving north again to attack it, but the message says the rat bit them. Alternatively, since the stairs up are southwest, but down might be elsewhere. The agent needs to explore the area. The agent is at (25,13). The stairs up are southwest, which would be towards (24,12) perhaps? But how to find the stairs down?

Since the agent's goal is to reach the stairs down, maybe they need to move away from the current area. The map shows horizontal walls in various directions. Maybe moving west towards the stairs up's direction isn't helpful. Alternatively, check other directions. If there's a vertical wall on the east, moving east isn't possible. So possible moves are north, west, south, northwest, southwest, etc., but need to see which directions are open.

The language observation says vertical wall adjacent east, so east is a wall. North has a horizontal wall near north. Wait, the horizontal wall near north could be a ceiling or floor obstruction. The agent is on a grid, so moving north might be possible if there's no wall. The message says ""It's a wall"" when the agent tried to move south earlier. So perhaps the agent is in a room with walls around, except maybe some passages.

Alternatively, since the stairs up are southwest, maybe the stairs down are in a different part of the level. The agent needs to explore further. The inventory shows a sword, armor, etc., but no amulet of yendor, which is the goal in some variants, but here it's stairs down.

Given that the agent is at (25,13) with a vertical wall to the east, maybe moving west towards the stairs up area isn't the way to go for stairs down. Alternatively, check other directions. The agent previously tried moving north, south, east, but got blocked. Maybe try moving northwest or southwest.

Wait, the stairs up are adjacent southwest, which would be moving southwest from the current position. But the agent's goal is stairs down, which is likely in another part of the level. So maybe the agent should explore other areas. Since the agent is in a room with walls, perhaps there's a corridor leading out. For example, moving west from (25,13) to (24,13) might be possible if there's no wall. The language observation says vertical wall very near east, west, etc. Wait, in the current observation, the vertical wall is near west? Let me check:

Language observation says: ""vertical wall near west"". So moving west might be possible. The agent is at (25,13). Moving west would take them to (24,13), which might be a passage. The previous map shows that at (24,13), there's a |.<.|, which might be a door or a path. Wait, in the last map, the agent's position is |.<.@|, so perhaps the agent is in the center of a room with a door to the west. Maybe moving west would open a path.

But the current language observation says vertical wall near west, which might mean that moving west is blocked. Wait, there's a contradiction here. The map might show a door as < or >, but the language observation says vertical wall near west. Hmm. Maybe the vertical wall is a solid wall, so moving west is blocked. But the agent was previously at (25,12) and moved south to (25,13), which had a vertical wall east. Now, at (25,13), the vertical wall adjacent east is still there. So moving east is blocked, but maybe moving west is possible if there's no wall.

Alternatively, the agent needs to look for other directions. Since the stairs down are the goal, and the agent is on level 1, they need to find the downward staircase. The previous attempts to move in various directions have been blocked, but perhaps moving southwest towards the stairs up area might lead somewhere. Wait, the stairs up are adjacent southwest, but the agent needs stairs down. Maybe the stairs down are in a different part of the level, so the agent needs to explore other parts.

Looking at the cursor position and map, the agent is in a room with various walls. The best approach might be to move towards the stairs up and then see if there's a way down, but that's not necessarily the case. Alternatively, the agent could try to move in a diagonal direction, like southwest, to see if that leads to a passage.

Another option is to use the attack command on the rat again, but the rat is to the north. However, attacking might not be effective if the agent is stuck in a room. The agent's health is at 7, and the rat is biting, so maybe staying aggressive is necessary.

Considering all this, the agent should try to move towards a direction that isn't blocked. Since moving east is a wall, west might be possible if there's no vertical wall. The language observation says ""vertical wall near west"", which could mean that moving west is blocked. Alternatively, perhaps the agent can move northwest or southwest.

In the previous steps, moving southwest from (25,13) would take the agent to (24,12), which is the stairs up location. But since the goal is stairs down, maybe moving in the opposite direction. Alternatively, check if there's a way out of the current room.

Wait, the agent's current position is (25,13), with a vertical wall to the east. The stairs up are southwest. Maybe the agent should move west to explore further. If moving west is possible, that could lead to a corridor or another room where stairs down are located.

Given that the agent's previous moves have been somewhat ineffective, perhaps the best action is to move west to see if that's possible. The language observation says ""vertical wall near west"", but that might refer to being very near, not directly adjacent. If the agent is at (25,13) and moves west to (24,13), the vertical wall nearby might still be present, but maybe there's a door or a passage.

Alternatively, the agent could try moving northwest or southwest. Moving southwest from (25,13) would be to (24,12), which is where the stairs up are. But that's not helpful for stairs down. Maybe moving northwest to (24,14), but the agent's y-coordinate is 13, so moving northwest would be (24,12), which is the stairs up location.

Hmm. This is a bit confusing. The agent needs to explore the level. Since the previous attacks on the rat are not leading to progress towards the stairs down, perhaps the agent should try to move in a direction that explores new areas. Given the walls, maybe moving west or south is possible.

Wait, the language observation says ""horizontal wall very near north, south, southwest, and northwest"". So moving north or south might hit a horizontal wall. The agent is currently at (25,13). Moving north would take them to (25,12), but there's a horizontal wall near north, so that's blocked. Moving south to (25,14) might be possible if there's no wall.

But the previous observation when moving south resulted in ""It's a wall."" So maybe moving south is blocked. The horizontal wall is very near south, so moving south is blocked. Therefore, possible moves are west, northwest, southwest, or other diagonals that aren't blocked.

The agent's inventory has a sword, so attacking the rat again might be necessary to prevent losing health. The rat is adjacent north, so attacking north could be effective. However, the previous attacks used commands like 'attack-east' which were invalid, so the agent defaulted to north. Maybe the correct command is 'attack north'.

But the user instructed that the action must be one of the listed directions or other valid actions. Attacking isn't in the initial list of possible actions provided (which are movement directions). The possible actions are the movement directions: north, east, south, west, etc. So the agent can't directly attack; it has to move to attack.

Therefore, the agent needs to move north to attack the rat. Even though the rat is adjacent, moving north into its space would allow attacking. But in MiniHack, moving into a monster's space might trigger an attack. Alternatively, the agent can try to attack from a distance, but with a sword, maybe moving next to it is necessary.

Given that the agent's health is low (7/16), staying aggressive is important. So the best action might be to move north to attack the rat again, preventing further damage. However, the previous attempts to move north may have been blocked due to walls. Wait, in the current observation, the agent is at (25,13), and the language observation says horizontal wall very near north. So moving north would hit a wall. That means the rat is north of the agent, but there's a wall in between. How is that possible?

Looking at the map, the agent's position is |.<.@|, which suggests that in the row above (north), there's a |...|, and the rat is in the row above that. Wait, the map might be structured differently. The agent is in the center of the room, with the rat to the north, behind a horizontal wall. So the agent can't move north into the wall, but the rat is beyond the wall. In that case, the agent can't reach the rat by moving north; they would have to find a way around the wall.

This complicates things. The agent needs to find a path around the wall to reach the rat. Since the rat is adjacent north behind a horizontal wall, the agent might need to move west or east to find a way around. But the vertical wall to the east blocks movement there. Moving west might open a passage.

In the current position, the agent is at (25,13). Moving west to (24,13) could be possible if there's no wall. The language observation says ""vertical wall near west"", but that might be a nearby wall, not directly adjacent. If moving west is possible, that could lead to a corridor where the agent can then move north around the wall to attack the rat.

Alternatively, moving southwest to (24,12), which is the stairs up location, but that's not helpful for stairs down. The agent's goal is stairs down, so they need to explore other areas.

Another possibility is that the agent should move in a diagonal direction, like northwest, to see if there's a passage. Moving northwest from (25,13) would be to (24,12), which is the stairs up location. But again, that's not helpful for stairs down.

Given the constraints, the best immediate action is to move west to explore that direction, as it's the only viable option that isn't blocked by a vertical wall to the east. If moving west is possible, the agent can then proceed to navigate around the horizontal wall to reach the rat and continue exploring for the stairs down.

Let's see. The goal is to reach the stairs down. The agent just got bitten by the giant rat again, bringing their HP down to 4. They need to avoid further damage while navigating to the stairs.

Looking at the current position (x=24, y=13), the stairs up are to the west. But the message says ""stairs up adjacent west"", so moving west would take them there. Wait, but earlier steps showed that stairs down might be the target. However, the current observation mentions stairs up, not down. Hmm, maybe there's a confusion. The initial goal was to reach the stairs down, so maybe the stairs up is a different location. But according to the problem statement, the agent needs to reach the stairs down, so perhaps there's a stairs down somewhere else.

The map shows that at (x=25, y=12), there's a stairs up adjacent southwest. But in the current position, the stairs up are to the west. However, the agent's current map might not show the stairs down clearly. The language observation mentions ""stairs up adjacent west"", indicating that west from here is stairs up. But the goal is stairs down, so maybe the stairs down is in another part of the level.

The giant rat is still nearby to the northeast. The agent was previously at x=24, y=13, and the rat is adjacent northeast. If the agent moves west to the stairs up, they might be moving away from the rat. But the stairs up might not be the target; the target is the stairs down. So perhaps the agent needs to explore more.

Looking at the map, there's a horizontal wall to the south and southwest. The vertical walls are to the east, west, etc. The agent needs to find a path that leads to the stairs down. Maybe moving south or southwest could be a direction. Alternatively, since the stairs up are west, maybe the stairs down is in a different part of the maze.

But given that the agent just got bitten again, and their HP is low, maybe they should first eliminate the threat of the giant rat. However, the rat is already defeated (there's a corpse to the north). Wait, no—the current rat is still alive, adjacent northeast. The previous rat was killed, but this one is still here. The agent needs to attack this rat to avoid getting killed.

So the priority is to attack the rat to the northeast. The agent is at (24,13). The rat is adjacent northeast, which would be (25,12). So moving northeast or attacking from here.

But the possible actions don't include attack commands directly; the user mentioned that attack-east was tried before, but it's not a valid action. The valid actions are movement directions. So to attack the rat, the agent needs to move into adjacent tiles to attack.

Given that the rat is adjacent northeast, the agent can move northeast to be next to it and attack. Alternatively, use a weapon, but movement is the only way to attack in this game, I think.

So moving northeast would position the agent next to the rat, allowing an attack. Then, repeatedly moving northeast and attacking until the rat is dead. But the agent's HP is low, so they need to be careful.

Alternatively, move west to the stairs up, but that might not help. The goal is stairs down, so maybe exploring other directions is better.

Looking at the map, moving south from (24,13) leads to a horizontal wall. Moving southwest might lead somewhere else. The vertical walls are to the east, west, etc. Maybe moving southwest could lead to a corridor.

Wait, the language observation says ""horizontal wall adjacent southeast, south, and southwest"". So moving south or southwest from here would hit a wall. So those directions are blocked. The agent can't go south or southwest directly.

The vertical walls are to the northeast, east, west, and northwest. So movement options are limited. The only open directions might be north, northeast, or west.

But the rat is to the northeast. Moving northeast would take the agent to (25,12), where the rat is. Then, perhaps attacking by moving next to it.

But in MiniHack, attacking is done by moving into the adjacent tile of the enemy. So to attack, the agent needs to move into the same tile as the enemy, which would kill both if both are monsters. Wait, no—killing the enemy requires dealing damage. So the agent needs to move next to the rat and then attack, which in the game is done by moving into the enemy's tile.

So the correct action here is to move northeast to (25,12), where the rat is. That way, the agent can attack by moving into it, dealing damage and possibly killing the rat, which would stop the biting.

Given that the agent's HP is low, eliminating the rat quickly is crucial. So the next action should be to move northeast to attack the rat.

I need to figure out the best next move here. Let's look at the current situation. The agent just killed the giant rat, so now the immediate threat is gone. The goal is to reach the stairs down, which according to the language observation is adjacent to the southwest.

Looking at the map, the agent is at position (24,13). The stairs up are southwest, but I need to check if the stairs down are there. Wait, in the initial problem statement, the goal is to reach the stairs down, but in the current observations, the message mentions stairs up. Maybe there's a typo, but likely the stairs down are somewhere else. 

The language observation says ""stairs up adjacent southwest"", so maybe the stairs down are in another part of the level. Since the agent is on level 1, perhaps the stairs down are on level 2, but I need to explore to find them. 

The agent's inventory has a +1 long sword, which is good, and other gear. The health is low at 4/16, but that's manageable. The current focus should be moving towards exploring the area to locate the stairs down. 

The nearby areas: moving southwest might lead towards the stairs up, but since the goal is stairs down, maybe that's not helpful. Let me check the map again. The map shows a structure with walls and the agent's position. From the cursor, the agent is in a room with walls around except maybe some corridors. 

Looking at the language observation, vertical walls are very near northeast, east, west, and northwest. So the agent is likely in a corner with walls on three sides. The horizontal walls are adjacent to south, southeast, and southwest. So possible movement is north, east, south, or west? Wait, vertical walls on east and northeast, so moving east might hit a wall. 

The agent should try to navigate the maze-like structure. Since the stairs down are the target, perhaps moving in a direction that expands exploration. The previous moves were east, south, etc., but got stuck into walls. 

Looking at the cursor position (24,13), moving southwest might go towards (23,12) or something, but need to check the map's layout. Alternatively, moving north could be possible if there's no wall. The language observation says horizontal wall near north, so north might be a wall. 

Wait, the language observation states: ""horizontal wall near north"" and ""vertical wall very near northeast, east, west, and northwest"". So moving north is blocked by a horizontal wall. Moving east is blocked by a vertical wall. Moving west is also blocked by a vertical wall. So the only possible directions are south or southeast? 

But the agent was previously at (24,13) and tried moving south, but it was a wall. Wait, no, in the last observation, moving south resulted in ""It's a wall."" So the agent is in a position where moving north, east, or west is blocked, but moving south might be possible. Wait, no, the language observation says horizontal wall adjacent southeast, south, and southwest. So moving south from (24,13) would be into a horizontal wall. 

Hmm, this is confusing. Let me re-examine the latest map. The map shows:

                      -----                                                     
                      |..%|                                                     
                      |....###                                                  
                      |.@.|                                                     
                      -----                                                     

But perhaps the exact layout is different. The agent is at (24,13), which in the map's grid might be in the fourth row (since y=13). The stairs up are adjacent southwest, so maybe at (23,12). But the agent needs to find the stairs down. 

Since movement is restricted in some directions, perhaps the best approach is to backtrack. The agent was previously moving east, then south, then encountered walls. Maybe moving west or north could open up a path. 

Alternatively, since the agent has a sword, maybe attack again if the rat reappears, but the rat is dead. So exploration is key. 

Looking at the possible actions: north, east, south, west, northeast, etc. But based on the walls, north and east are blocked. So options are south, west, or diagonal directions like southwest or northwest. 

The stairs down are the target. If the stairs up are southwest, maybe the stairs down are in another direction. The agent needs to explore further. 

Perhaps moving west to (23,13) and then see if there's a path. Or moving southwest to (23,12). Let's check the language observation again. It says ""horizontal wall adjacent southeast, south, and southwest"". So moving south or southwest would hit a horizontal wall. Moving southwest from (24,13) would go to (23,12), which is adjacent to a horizontal wall. So that's a wall. 

So the only possible movement is west or north. But north is a horizontal wall. Wait, the language observation says ""horizontal wall near north"", which might mean that moving north from the agent's position is into a wall. So the agent can't move north. 

Therefore, the possible moves are west or southwest. But southwest is a wall. So west to (23,13). Let's see what's there. The map shows that at (24,13) the agent is in a cell with a '@' symbol, indicating their position. To the west (23,13), looking at the map, the third row (assuming y=13 is the third row) has ""|....###"", so maybe that's a corridor. But the exact layout is unclear. 

Alternatively, maybe moving northeast to (25,14), but the vertical wall is near northeast. So that's a wall. 

Given the restrictions, the best bet is to move west to (23,13) to explore further. If that's a wall, then perhaps the agent is in a dead end and needs to try another direction. 

Alternatively, check if moving northwest is possible. The vertical wall is near northwest, so moving northwest would hit a wall. 

So the only feasible move is west. Let's try that.

Let's see. The goal is to reach the stairs down. From the current observation, I need to figure out where the stairs are. Looking at the language observation, it says the stairs up are adjacent east. But the agent is trying to reach the stairs down, so maybe the stairs up here are just a checkpoint, and the actual target is downstairs.

The map shows that the agent is at (23,13). The stairs up are east, which would be at (24,13). But since the goal is stairs down, perhaps the stairs down are elsewhere. The messages mention that the giant rat is dead now, so that threat is gone. The agent needs to explore the level.

Looking around, the cursor position is (23,13), and the map shows some walls and open areas. The horizontal walls are near north, and the vertical walls are near east and west. The stairs up are east, but maybe there's another way down.

Possible actions: move east to the stairs up, but that's not the goal. Alternatively, check other directions. The agent could move north, south, west, or northeast. But west leads back to where the giant rat was, which is now a corpse.

Wait, the stairs down might be in a different part of the level. Since the agent is on Dlvl:1, stairs down are probably elsewhere. The current map doesn't show stairs down, so the agent needs to explore further. The dark area mentioned earlier might lead somewhere.

Looking at the language observation: ""dark area very near southeast"". So moving southeast could lead to an unexplored area. Alternatively, moving north or east. But east is the stairs up, which is a dead end here. Maybe moving south or southwest?

The agent's previous attempts to go south hit walls. Let me check the map again. The map at (23,13) shows |@<.|, so the agent is facing south. The horizontal wall is adjacent southeast and south. So moving south would hit a wall. Moving east to (24,13) is the stairs up, but that's not helpful.

The dark area is southeast. So moving southeast might be a good idea. Let's try that. The action would be ""southeast"". Alternatively, check if there's a corridor. But the map shows ### which might be walls. Hmm.

Alternatively, moving northeast. The agent was there before killing the rat. But maybe that's a dead end. The vertical walls are near northeast, east, west, and northwest. So moving northeast might be blocked.

Alternatively, move north. The horizontal wall is near north, but adjacent to northwest and northeast. So moving north from (23,13) would be into a wall. So that's not possible.

So the best bet is to move southeast into the dark area. That might reveal a path downward or to stairs down. Let's go with ""southeast"".

Let's see where I am. I'm a knight on a dungeon level 1. My goal is to reach the stairs down. So far, I've fought a giant rat and killed it. Now, I need to figure out the next steps.

Looking at the observations, the walls and the layout. My current position is (23, 13). The stairs up are adjacent to the east. Wait, but the message says stairs up adjacent east. So moving east towards there might get me closer. But earlier when I tried moving east, sometimes there were walls or the rat. Let me check the map again.

The map shows some hash symbols (###) which might be walls or other structures. The stairs up are near east, so maybe moving east is the way to go. But I need to avoid walls. The language observation says horizontal wall adjacent southeast and south. So moving southeast or south from here would hit a wall. Maybe moving east first to get closer to the stairs.

Wait, but in the recent actions, when I tried moving east from (24, y=11) to (25, y=11), there was a wall. So maybe the stairs are east of the current position (23,13). Let's try moving east to (24,13). But need to check if that's a wall.

Looking at the language observation: vertical wall near east. Hmm, maybe moving east is blocked. So perhaps I need to go south or another direction. But the stairs are east, so maybe there's a path there. Let me think.

The last observation after killing the rat shows the cursor at (24, y=13) but then moved west to (23,13). The stairs are adjacent east, so east from (23,13) would be (24,13). But the vertical wall near east might block that. Wait, the vertical wall is very near northeast, east, west, and northwest. Wait, the vertical wall is adjacent east. So moving east from (23,13) to (24,13) might be against that vertical wall. So that's blocked. Then how to get to the stairs?

Alternatively, maybe move southeast, but the horizontal wall adjacent southeast and south. So moving southeast from (23,13) would be into a wall. So that's not good. What about moving north? The horizontal wall near north, but maybe there's a passage there. The message when moving north earlier said ""It's a wall,"" but perhaps there's a way through.

Wait, the language observation says horizontal wall near north. So moving north from (23,13) would hit that wall. So that's blocked. Then maybe moving southwest? The vertical wall adjacent west and northwest. From (23,13), moving southwest would be to (22,12). Is that a wall? The southwest corner is adjacent southwest. Maybe it's a corner, so moving southwest is possible if there's a passage.

Alternatively, since the stairs are east, perhaps I need to find another path around the vertical wall. Maybe move south to (23,14) and then east? Let's check the horizontal walls. The horizontal wall adjacent southeast and south. So moving south from (23,13) to (23,14) would be into the horizontal wall. Not good.

Hmm. Maybe the best approach is to move east carefully. Wait, but the vertical wall is adjacent east. So perhaps moving east is blocked. Then maybe I need to go around the wall. Let's see the map again. The map shows |....###| at position y=13. The ### might be a wall extending east. So from (23,13) moving east into that wall. So I can't go east directly. Then how to reach the stairs up which are adjacent east?

Alternatively, perhaps the stairs are in a different location. Wait, the stairs up very near southsouthwest in the initial observations, but after killing the rat, the stairs up are adjacent east. So maybe the stairs are east of the rat's corpse. Let's see the map after killing the rat. The rat corpse is at (24,13), and the stairs up are adjacent east, so (25,13). But moving east from (24,13) to (25,13) was a wall before. So maybe the stairs are in a different spot.

This is getting confusing. Maybe I should try moving in a different direction. Let's try moving south. The horizontal wall adjacent south, so moving south would hit a wall. How about moving west? From (23,13) moving west to (22,13). The vertical wall adjacent west and northwest. So moving west would hit the wall. So that's blocked.

What about moving northwest? That would be to (22,12). The northwest room corner is near northwest. Maybe that's a passage. Let me try moving northwest. If that's possible, it might lead me around the wall. Then from there, perhaps I can proceed east towards the stairs.

Alternatively, since I have a sword and shield, maybe I should keep exploring. Wait, the goal is to reach the stairs down, not necessarily to explore everything. So maybe I need to find the stairs up (since the message says stairs up adjacent east) and then go up, but the problem statement says to reach the stairs down. Wait, the initial instruction was to reach the stairs down. So perhaps the stairs down are elsewhere.

Wait, the user's initial instruction was: ""Your goal is to explore the level and reach the stairs down."" So I need to find the stairs down, not the stairs up. But the current observations mention stairs up adjacent east. So maybe the stairs down are somewhere else. Maybe I need to move around to find them.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the observations. Let me check again. The latest language observation says: ""stairs up adjacent east"". So the stairs up are east, but I need the stairs down. So maybe I need to proceed to the stairs up first (as that's the only stairs mentioned) and then go down from there. But the problem states to reach the stairs down, so perhaps the stairs down are on a different level. But MiniHack might have the stairs down in the same level in some cases, but usually, they are on different levels.

Wait, the agent is at Dlvl:1. So stairs down would be to Dlvl:2. But maybe in this level, the stairs down are not yet revealed, or are in a different part of the map. So perhaps I need to explore more to find them.

Given that the current position is (23,13) with stairs up east (but I need down), maybe I should try to find another path. Let's check the map again. The map shows a section with |....###| at y=13. The ### might be a wall. Maybe there's a corridor to the north or south.

Looking at the language observation: horizontal wall adjacent north, southeast, and southwest. Wait, no, the latest language observation after moving to (23,13) says: ""horizontal wall adjacent southeast and south"". So moving south from (23,13) would hit a wall. Moving southeast is also blocked. Moving north is blocked by a horizontal wall. Moving east is blocked by a vertical wall. Moving west is blocked by a vertical wall. Moving northwest to (22,12): the vertical wall adjacent west and northwest. So maybe moving northwest is possible if there's a passage there.

Alternatively, perhaps the agent should pick up items. The inventory has a +1 long sword, ring mail, etc. But not sure if that's necessary right now. The main goal is to reach the stairs down.

Given that all adjacent directions are blocked by walls except maybe northwest, which might lead to a passage. Let's try moving northwest to (22,12). If that's a valid move, it could help navigate around the walls and possibly find the stairs down.

Alternatively, since the agent is a knight, maybe they can dig through walls, but I don't think that's a standard action in MiniHack unless specified. The available actions are movement directions. So probably can't dig.

Another option is to move in a different pattern, like going around the block. For example, move north as far as possible, then west, then south, etc., to explore. But given the current walls, that might not work.

Wait, the initial map after killing the rat showed a section with |@<.| at y=13. The '<' indicates the agent's position facing west. So maybe the agent is facing west. If I turn around, maybe I can see different parts of the map. But turning is not an available action in the list provided. The available actions are only movement directions. So I can't turn; I have to move in the four cardinal directions or diagonals.

So, the agent is at (23,13), facing west. To change direction, need to move in a way that makes them face another direction. For example, moving north would make them face northwest, but not sure. Alternatively, moving east might make them face east, but that's blocked.

This is getting a bit stuck. Let me recap:

- Need to reach stairs down.
- Current position: (23,13), facing west.
- Stairs up adjacent east (but need down).
- All adjacent directions (north, east, south, west) seem to have walls except maybe moving northwest around the vertical wall.

So, perhaps the best action is to move northwest to (22,12), which might be a passage. If that's allowed, then proceed from there. If not, maybe another direction.

Alternatively, since the vertical wall is adjacent east, maybe moving south first to (23,14), but that's blocked by a horizontal wall. Not helpful.

Another thought: the agent has a sword, so maybe attacking in a direction. But the available actions don't include attacks except ""attack-east"" etc. But previous attempts to attack east resulted in errors because it's a wall. So attacking might not be useful here unless there's an enemy.

Since the giant rat is defeated, there's no enemy nearby. So attacking isn't helpful.

Given all this, the most plausible action is to move northwest to (22,12), hoping that's a valid move around the wall. Let's try that.

I need to figure out what the best action is here. Let me look at the current situation.

First, the agent just tried moving northwest, but there's a wall there. So moving further northwest isn't going to work. Now, the agent is at position (23, 13). The stairs up are adjacent to the east, which is position (24, 13). But the agent's current position is (23,13), so moving east once would reach the stairs. However, there's a giant rat corpse near northeast, and previously, there was a giant rat, but it's already dead. 

Wait, in the last few steps, the agent killed the giant rat to the northeast, so that area is clear now. The stairs up are to the east. The agent's current HP is 5, which is low, so maybe moving towards the stairs to descend would be a good idea. Also, the agent has some healing items like apples and carrots in the inventory. Maybe using one of those would help recover HP before moving further, but the problem is that the agent needs to explore and reach the stairs down. 

Alternatively, since the stairs up are adjacent to the east, moving east would get the agent to the stairs. But the agent's previous attempts to move east encountered a wall, but only after killing the giant rat. Wait, no—after killing the rat, the agent was at (24,13), and then moving south led to a wall. But now the agent is back at (23,13). The stairs up are adjacent to the east, so moving east once should reach them. Wait, the stairs up are adjacent east in the current language observation. So the agent is at (23,13), and east would be (24,13), which has the stairs up. So moving east should work now. 

But the agent tried moving east before and got a message ""It's a wall,"" but that was when the giant rat was still alive. After killing the rat, maybe the layout changed? Or perhaps the stairs are in a different position. Let me check the map again. 

Looking at the map, the stairs up are adjacent southwest in some observations, but now the latest observation says stairs up adjacent east. So the agent is at (23,13), and moving east to (24,13) should be the stairs. Therefore, the correct action is to move east to reach the stairs up. 

But wait, the agent's current position is (23,13), and the stairs up are adjacent east. So moving east would take them to the stairs. That should be the goal. However, the agent's HP is low (5/16), so maybe using a healing item like an apple or carrot first would be safer. But the problem statement says the goal is to reach the stairs down. However, in this case, the stairs up are present, but the agent needs to reach the stairs down to progress. Wait, the initial goal was to reach the stairs down, not up. So maybe there's a confusion here. 

Wait, the original problem statement says: ""Your goal is to explore the level and reach the stairs down."" So the stairs down are the target. But in the current observation, the stairs up are adjacent east. That suggests that the agent is at a point where there are stairs up, but the goal is stairs down. However, perhaps the agent needs to go upstairs first to get to the next level, but that's not the case here. The initial instruction was to reach the stairs down on the current level. 

Hmm, maybe there's a misunderstanding. Let me check the latest map. The map shows that at position (24,12), there's a '@' which is the agent, and stairs up are adjacent southwest. But in the current observation after killing the rat, the stairs up are adjacent east. So perhaps the agent is now next to the stairs up. But the goal is stairs down. So maybe the agent needs to find the stairs down elsewhere. 

Alternatively, perhaps the stairs down are somewhere else in the level. The agent needs to explore more. But given that the agent is stuck trying to move towards the stairs up, maybe moving east is the way to go, but the agent's previous attempts resulted in a wall. Wait, in the current observation, the language says stairs up adjacent east, so moving east should take the agent to the stairs. But when the agent tried moving east before, they got a message ""It's a wall."" That was when there was a giant rat adjacent east, blocking the path. After killing the rat, the path should be clear. 

Wait, looking back at the history: after killing the giant rat to the northeast, the agent moved west to (24,13), then tried moving south which was a wall, then east again. Maybe after killing the rat, the agent's position changed, and the stairs up are now east. Therefore, moving east should be possible now. 

Alternatively, maybe the stairs down are in another part of the level. The agent needs to explore more. But since the agent's goal is to reach the stairs down, and the current observation shows stairs up to the east, perhaps the agent needs to move east to the stairs up first, but that's not the goal. Wait, maybe the agent is on the first level, and the stairs down are elsewhere. The agent needs to find them. 

Given that the agent is low on HP, moving towards the stairs up (which are present) might be a way to heal or get equipment, but the primary goal is stairs down. However, without knowing the layout of the level, the agent might need to maneuver around. 

Looking at the current position (23,13), the stairs up are east. If moving east takes the agent to the stairs up, but the goal is stairs down, perhaps the agent should proceed to the stairs up first, then go back down. But that's not specified in the problem; the problem just says to reach the stairs down. So maybe the agent needs to find them elsewhere. 

Alternatively, perhaps the agent made a mistake in previous moves and is now in a position where moving east leads to a wall. But according to the latest language observation, stairs up are adjacent east, so moving east should work. 

Wait, the cursor position is (23,13), and the stairs up are adjacent east. So moving east to (24,13) should be the stairs. But when the agent tried moving east before, there was a wall. That suggests that maybe after killing the rat, the layout changed. Wait, maybe the stairs are in a different position. Let me check the map again. 

In the current map, the agent is at |@<.| on the third line. The stairs up are adjacent east, which would be the next cell to the east. So the cell to the east (24,13) is the stairs up. But the agent's inventory has healing items. Maybe the agent should use an apple or carrot to heal before moving towards the stairs, but the problem requires the agent to reach the stairs down, not necessarily heal. 

Alternatively, perhaps the agent should check if moving east is possible now that the rat is dead. Since the latest observation says stairs up are adjacent east, moving east should take the agent there. But the agent's previous attempt to move east resulted in a wall, which was when the rat was still alive. Now that the rat is dead, the path should be clear. 

Therefore, the correct action is to move east to reach the stairs up. However, the goal is stairs down. This is confusing. Maybe there's a misunderstanding in the problem setup. Alternatively, perhaps the stairs down are in the same location as the stairs up, but that's unlikely. 

Given the information available, the safest action is to move towards the stairs up (east) as per the current observation, assuming that it's the correct path. Once there, the agent can descend, but the problem states the goal is stairs down. Maybe the agent needs to go upstairs first to reach the next level's stairs down. But that's not specified. 

Alternatively, the agent should continue exploring. Since the agent is stuck trying to move towards the stairs, maybe moving in another direction would help. For example, moving south or north. 

Looking at the language observation: horizontal wall near south, vertical wall very near east, etc. The agent is at (23,13). The horizontal wall is near south, so moving south might hit a wall. The vertical wall is very near east, but the stairs up are adjacent east, so perhaps the stairs are on a different level. 

Wait, the message when moving east previously was ""It's a wall,"" but now the stairs up are adjacent east. This inconsistency suggests that perhaps the agent's perception is correct now, and moving east should work. 

Therefore, the best action is to move east to the stairs up, assuming that's the correct path, even though the goal is stairs down. Maybe the stairs down are on the next level, so moving up first is necessary. 

Alternatively, the agent should use a healing item. For example, using an apple (g) or carrot (h) to recover HP before moving further. But the problem requires taking actions to reach the stairs down, so using an item might not be the priority unless necessary. 

Given the current situation, the agent's priority is to reach the stairs down. Since the agent is stuck near the stairs up, perhaps moving east is the way to go, even if it's the stairs up, to proceed to the next level and find the actual stairs down there. 

So, the chosen action is to move east.

Let me try to figure out what the best move is here. The agent has just killed the last giant rat, and now the goal is to explore the level and reach the stairs down. Let's look at the current observations.

The agent is at position (24,13). The language observation mentions stairs up adjacent east. So the stairs must be to the east. But the agent's current position's east is blocked by a vertical wall. Wait, no—the stairs up are adjacent east, meaning they're right there. But the map shows that at (25,13), which is east, there's a vertical wall. But the stairs up are very near southeast, but in the last observation, the stairs up were adjacent east. Hmm, maybe there's a confusion in the map rendering. Alternatively, maybe the stairs are in a different direction.

Looking at the map, the agent's current position's map line is |.@.|, which is row 13. The east direction from (24,13) would be to (25,13), which is a vertical wall according to the language observation. But the stairs up are adjacent east. That seems contradictory. Maybe the stairs are in another part of the map.

Wait, the previous messages indicated that after killing the rat, the stairs up were adjacent east. But according to the current map, moving east is a wall. So perhaps the stairs are actually in a different location. The agent needs to check again.

Alternatively, maybe the stairs are in the southeast corner. The language observation mentioned dark area very near southeast, but stairs up were very near southsouthwest in an earlier step. This is a bit confusing. The agent needs to navigate carefully.

Since the stairs down are the target, and the stairs up are adjacent east but there's a wall there, perhaps the agent needs to move in another direction. Let's check the map again. The current map shows the agent's position as |.@.| in row 13. The east of that is a vertical wall. The stairs up were previously adjacent east, but now maybe they're in another direction. Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to move south or southeast to find the stairs.

Wait, looking back at the previous steps, after killing the rat, the agent moved west to (23,13) and then east back to (24,13). The stairs up were adjacent east at that time. But now, according to the current observation, moving east is a wall. So perhaps the stairs are not in that direction anymore, or the agent's perception has changed.

Alternatively, maybe the agent should check the south direction. The language observation mentions horizontal wall adjacent south and southwest. So moving south from (24,13) would lead to a horizontal wall. Maybe moving southwest? But that's a vertical wall. Alternatively, the agent should look for another path.

The agent's inventory has a sword, armor, and some food. Since the goal is to reach the stairs down, which is likely downstairs, the agent should proceed to explore further. However, the current position is blocked east and south. Maybe moving west again to (23,13) and then trying a different direction.

Alternatively, perhaps the stairs are in the southeast area. The dark area very near southeast could be a corridor leading down. The agent should move southeast to check. But the previous attempts to move southeast resulted in walls. Hmm.

Wait, the agent's cursor is at (24,13), and the stairs up were adjacent east. But the current map shows that moving east is a vertical wall. This inconsistency suggests that the agent needs to reorient. Maybe the stairs are actually in another part of the map, perhaps in the southwest direction where there's a horizontal wall.

Alternatively, the agent can try moving north. The language observation mentions horizontal walls near north, so moving north might hit a wall. Alternatively, moving southwest. The vertical wall is adjacent west and northwest, so moving southwest from (24,13) would be to (23,14), which might be a passage.

But according to the current map, the agent's position is in a room with walls around, and the stairs up are east, but blocked. Maybe the agent needs to use the stairs up to go back up, but the goal is to reach the stairs down. Wait, the problem statement says the goal is to reach the stairs down, not up. So perhaps the agent needs to find the downstairs stairs, which might be in a different location.

In previous steps, the stairs up were very near southsouthwest. That area might have the downstairs. The agent should head there. To get to southsouthwest from (24,13), moving southwest twice would take the agent to (22,15). But the current map doesn't show that area. The agent needs to explore further.

Alternatively, the agent can move south to (24,14), but the language observation says horizontal wall adjacent south and southwest. So moving south would hit a wall. Moving southwest from (24,13) to (23,14) might be possible if there's no wall there. However, the language observation mentions vertical walls very near west, northwest, etc. So moving southwest might be into a wall.

This is getting a bit confusing. The agent should try to move in a direction that wasn't blocked before. For example, moving north might lead to a passage. The previous map showed a horizontal wall adjacent north and northwest. So moving north from (24,13) would be to (24,12), which was previously a position with a giant rat. The map there showed |.@r.|, so maybe moving north is possible.

Alternatively, the agent could move west to (23,13) and then try different directions. From (23,13), moving southeast might be an option. But earlier attempts to move southeast resulted in walls. Maybe the agent needs to check again.

Wait, the current language observation says horizontal wall adjacent southeast, south, and southwest. So from (24,13), moving southeast would be to (25,14), which is a horizontal wall. Moving south to (24,14) is a horizontal wall. Moving southwest to (23,14) is a vertical wall. So all those directions are blocked. The only open directions might be north or east, but east is a wall.

This suggests that the agent is trapped in a room with walls on most sides, except perhaps north. Moving north from (24,13) to (24,12) was previously where the giant rat was. But that area is now cleared. The agent could move north to check if there's a way out.

Alternatively, the agent should check if there's a staircase in the north direction. The previous observations mentioned stairs up very near southsouthwest, but that might be a different staircase. The agent's goal is to find the stairs down, which could be in another part of the level.

Given the current information, the safest bet might be to move north to (24,12), as that area was previously accessible and might lead to a new path. Alternatively, since the stairs up are adjacent east but currently a wall, maybe the agent needs to reposition to find the actual stairs down.

In conclusion, considering the agent's current position and the blocked directions, moving north to explore the previous area where the giant rat was might be a good approach to find a path downward.

Let's see. I need to get to the stairs down. The current observation shows that the stairs up are adjacent to the south. But the goal is to reach the stairs down, which I haven't found yet.

In the previous steps, I fought the giant rat and killed it. Now, the stairs up are nearby, but I think the stairs down might be in another part of the level. Since I'm on Dlvl:1, maybe the stairs down are in another room or corridor. 

Looking at the map, there are walls in various directions. The horizontal wall is near north and south, and there's a vertical wall to the west. The giant rat corpse is to the northeast, but the stairs up are south. So maybe moving south towards the stairs up isn't helpful for getting down. 

Wait, the problem is to reach the stairs down, not up. So perhaps I need to explore further. The map shows some areas as dark, like far east. Maybe moving east or southeast could lead to a different room where the stairs down are located. 

The language observation mentions a dark area far east. That could be a good direction to move. Also, there's a horizontal wall adjacent to the southeast, south, and southwest. So moving east might open up a path. 

Alternatively, since the stairs up are south, maybe moving in the opposite direction (north, west, etc.) could lead to another area. But the vertical wall to the west might block movement there. 

Another thought: perhaps taking the stairs up first isn't necessary. But in MiniHack, usually, you need to go down to proceed to deeper levels. However, the initial goal here is specifically to reach the stairs down, so maybe I should explore the current level thoroughly first. 

Looking at the cursor position (24,12), and the map layout, moving east could lead towards the dark area. Let me check the possible actions. The valid moves are the eight cardinal directions and their diagonals. 

Since the vertical wall is near west, moving west isn't possible. What about east? If I move east, maybe I can reach the dark area. The language observation says dark area far east, so perhaps moving east step by step. 

Alternatively, moving southeast might take me into a corridor. Let me check the map again. The map shows some symbols like '###' which might be walls. The current position has '@' at (24,12), and the stairs up are south. 

Wait, the latest map shows that at (24,12), the agent is positioned with the stairs up south. The dark area is far east, so moving east could lead towards that. 

I think the best move here is to move east towards the dark area, exploring further. That might lead to a new room or corridor where the stairs down are located. Alternatively, moving south to the stairs up, but that's not the goal. 

So, the chosen action should be 'east' to proceed towards the dark area and explore more of the level.

Let's see. The goal is to reach the stairs down, which are located southwest according to the last observation. The current position is (25, 12), and the stairs are adjacent southwest.

Looking at the language observation, there's a giant rat adjacent to the east. The message says the rat bit me, reducing my HP to 2. That's low, so maybe I need to avoid getting attacked again. 

My inventory includes a +1 long sword (wielded), a +1 lance, armor, shield, etc. Carrots and apples are there, but maybe using a projectile or a weapon is better. The stairs are southwest, which is a direction I can move towards. 

But moving directly east towards the rat would get me into more danger. Maybe I can move southwest towards the stairs while keeping some distance from the rat. Alternatively, attack the rat again to eliminate it once and for all, which would clear the area. 

However, with low HP, attacking might not be safe. If I attack east, the rat could bite again. So perhaps moving southwest first to reach the stairs is safer, then deal with the rat on the way back if necessary. 

Alternatively, use the lance as a ranged weapon. The lance is in slot b, not wielded. To attack with the lance, I would need to wield it first with ' wield b ', then attack. But that requires two actions, which might not be ideal if the rat is attacking. 

Another option is to use an apple or carrot as a distraction, but that's unlikely to defeat the rat. So better to attack it directly. But since HP is low, maybe fleeing to the stairs is better. 

The stairs are southwest, so moving southwest from (25,12) would take me to (24,11), which is the stairs up location mentioned earlier. Wait, but the stairs down are supposed to be in a different location. Wait, in the first observation, the stairs up were south, but maybe the stairs down are elsewhere. Wait, the problem statement says the goal is to reach the stairs down, but in the initial observations, the stairs up are present. So perhaps the map has multiple stairs. Need to check the map.

Looking at the map provided in the latest observation, the stairs up are at (24,11), marked with '<'. But the stairs down would be a different symbol, like '>', but I don't see that in the current map. So maybe the agent needs to explore further. However, the latest observations show that the stairs up are adjacent southwest, so perhaps moving southwest from (24,12) would reach the stairs up, but the goal is stairs down. Hmm, maybe there's a confusion here. Wait, the initial problem says to reach the stairs down, so perhaps the stairs down are located elsewhere in the level, not where the stairs up are. 

Given that the current map doesn't show stairs down, the agent needs to explore more. But given the current position and the need to avoid the rat, moving towards the stairs up (southwest) might not be the right direction. Alternatively, moving in a direction that's away from the rat and towards unexplored areas. 

Looking at the language observation, there's a dark area near east, vertical walls near west, and the stairs up are southwest. The horizontal walls are near north, south, southwest, and northwest. So the agent is in a corridor with walls on north, south, southwest, and northwest, and a vertical wall to the west. The east direction has a giant rat. 

So possible safe moves are south, southwest, or west. Moving west would take me to (24,12), which is the previous position. Moving southwest to (23,11), but need to check if that's a wall. The language observation says horizontal wall very near north, south, southwest, and northwest. So moving southwest from (24,12) would be to (23,11), which is southwest corner adjacent to a horizontal wall. So that's a wall. Therefore, can't move southwest from there. 

Alternative directions: south to (24,13), which was previously a position with a horizontal wall. Or east, but the rat is there. So perhaps the best move is to move north, but the horizontal wall is near north. The language observation says horizontal wall very near north, so moving north would hit a wall. 

Wait, the latest language observation says: horizontal wall very near north, south, southwest, and northwest. So the agent is near a T-shaped corridor? With north and south walls, and southwest/northwest walls. So possible movement directions are east, southeast, or maybe south? 

But the agent is at (24,12). If moving south to (24,13), but earlier observations showed that moving south from (24,11) was a wall. Wait, in earlier steps, when the agent was at (24,11), moving south resulted in a wall. Now at (24,12), moving south would be to (24,13), which according to the latest map is '.' which is floor. Wait, the map shows:

At (24,12), the cursor is on '@', and the map line is |..@r###|, which suggests that in the row y=12, the agent is at position 24, with a rat to the east. So moving south from (24,12) would go to y=13, which in the map is |.<.|, so the agent would be at (24,13), which is a floor. 

But earlier when the agent moved south from (24,11) to (24,12), that was valid. So maybe moving south again is possible. However, the rat is adjacent east at (25,12). So moving south to (24,13) would be away from the rat, but then the agent is in a corridor with walls on north, south, southwest, and northwest. 

Alternatively, move west to (23,12), which according to the map is |..%|, where '%' is the rat corpse. So west is clear. Then from (23,12), move southwest to (22,11), but need to check if that's a wall. The language observation says horizontal wall very near southwest, so moving southwest from (23,12) would be to (22,11), which is a horizontal wall. 

Hmm. This is getting complicated. The primary goal is to reach the stairs down, which isn't currently visible on the map. The agent has killed the giant rat, but now needs to navigate to the stairs. Since the stairs up are at (24,11), but the goal is stairs down, perhaps the agent needs to explore other areas. 

Given the current position and the need to avoid the rat (which is now dead, since the latest observation shows the corpse adjacent north), maybe the agent can move towards the stairs up, but that's not the goal. Wait, the message says ""reach the stairs down"", so perhaps the stairs down are located elsewhere. 

In the initial observations, the stairs up were south, but maybe the stairs down are in another part of the level. The agent needs to explore further. Since the agent is at (24,12), and the last move was east into a rat, which is now dead, the safe move might be to move west back to (23,12), then explore other directions. 

But the language observation mentions a dark area near east, which could be an unexplored room. Moving east into the dark area might reveal new paths. However, the agent's HP is low (2), so taking risks is not advisable. 

Alternatively, pick up items. The inventory shows apples and carrots, but no healing items. Using a carrot could restore HP, but that's a risk. However, 'use' commands are not in the list of possible actions. The allowed actions are movement directions. 

So, considering all this, the best action might be to move southwest towards where the stairs up are, but that's not the stairs down. Alternatively, move north, but there's a horizontal wall. Move south to (24,13), which is a floor. From there, perhaps move west or east. But east has the rat's corpse, which is safe now. 

Wait, the latest language observation says the giant rat corpse is adjacent north. So the rat is dead. That's good. So the agent can move east safely now. 

So from (25,12), moving east would go to (26,12), which was previously a wall? Wait, in the map, the row y=12 is |..@r###|, which at position 24 is '@', 25 is 'r' (rat), and then '###' which are walls. So moving east from (25,12) would hit a wall. 

So the agent is at (25,12), east is a wall. The stairs up are southwest at (24,11). The agent needs to reach stairs down, which are probably in another part of the level. Since the agent has killed the rats, maybe exploration is the way. 

Possible moves: south to (25,13), which in the map is |....###|, so floor. Then from there, maybe move west or south. 

Alternatively, move west to (24,12), which is the agent's previous position. Then from there, move south to (24,13), then explore other directions. 

But given the low HP, the agent should avoid unnecessary risks. The safest move might be to move southwest towards the stairs up, but that's not the goal. Alternatively, move south to (25,13) and then west to (24,13), then south again. 

Alternatively, since the stairs down are the goal, and the agent hasn't found them yet, perhaps the best approach is to keep moving in a direction that explores new areas. Given that moving east is blocked, moving south to (25,13) and then west or south again. 

But given the time steps and previous actions, maybe the agent should move southwest to (24,11), where the stairs up are, but that's not the stairs down. Hmm, this is confusing. 

Wait, the problem statement says the goal is to reach the stairs down. In NetHack, there are multiple stairs: up and down. The agent needs to find the down stairs. Since the initial observation had stairs up south, but the down stairs might be in another part of the level. 

The agent has explored the area around (24,11) to (25,13) and killed the rats. Now, to proceed, the agent needs to move to unexplored areas. The dark area near east (according to the latest language observation) could be a new room. Moving east into the dark area might reveal the stairs down. 

But moving east from (25,12) is blocked by a wall. So the agent can't go east directly. The alternative is to move south to (25,13), then east might be possible? Looking at the map row y=13: |....###|, which at position 25 is '.', so floor. Then from (25,13), moving east would be into '###', which are walls. So that's not useful. 

Alternatively, move south to (25,13), then west to (24,13), then south to (24,14), etc., exploring further. 

But the agent's priority is to reach the stairs down. Since the current map doesn't show them, the agent needs to proceed deeper. Given the available moves and avoiding walls, the best option might be to move southwest to (24,11), which is the stairs up location, but that's not helpful. 

Alternatively, move north, but there's a horizontal wall. 

Wait, the latest language observation says horizontal wall very near north, so moving north from (25,12) is impossible. 

The agent is stuck in a corridor with walls on north, south (partially), and east. The safest path might be to move west back to (24,12), then south to (24,13), then west to (23,13), and so on, exploring the area. 

Alternatively, since the stairs down are likely in a different part of the level, the agent should try to move in a direction that's away from the current area. Given that the agent is at (25,12), moving southwest to (24,11) is towards the stairs up, but that's not down. 

Maybe the agent should move south twice to (25,14), then explore west or east. 

But without knowing the map layout further, it's hard to say. The key is to avoid the rat (now dead) and move towards unexplored areas. 

Considering all this, the best action might be to move south to (25,13), then west to (24,13), then south again, gradually exploring the area. However, given the low HP, the agent should avoid getting attacked again. Since the rat is dead, moving east is now safe, but the wall blocks that. 

Alternatively, move west to (24,12), then south to (24,13), then west to (23,13), and check for stairs. 

But given the time steps and the need to act, the immediate safe move is to move southwest to (24,11), where the stairs up are, but that's not the goal. Alternatively, move south to (25,13) and then west. 

Wait, the agent's current position is (25,12). Moving south to (25,13) is allowed, as per the map. From there, moving west to (24,13), which is a floor. Then from (24,13), moving southwest to (23,12), but that's a floor. Then from (23,12), moving southwest to (22,11), which is a wall. 

This seems like a dead end. Alternatively, from (23,12), move south to (23,13), which might be a new area. 

But the agent's main goal is stairs down. Since they aren't visible, perhaps the best action is to move in a direction that's exploring new areas, like south or southwest. 

Given that moving southwest from (25,12) would be to (24,11), which has stairs up, but not down. Maybe the agent should move south to (25,13), then west to (24,13), then south to (24,14), etc. 

Alternatively, since the agent has killed the rats, maybe the stairs down are in the same area but in a different location. The initial observation had stairs up south, so maybe the stairs down are in another part of the room. 

But without more information, it's hard to tell. The safest bet with low HP is to move towards unexplored areas, avoiding walls. 

In the latest language observation, there's a dark area near east, which is at (26,12), but that's a wall. So maybe moving south to (25,13), then west to (24,13), then south to (24,14), and so on. 

Alternatively, move west to (24,12), then south to (24,13), then west to (23,13), then check for stairs. 

But given the time constraints, perhaps the best immediate action is to move south to (25,13), then west. 

However, looking at the allowed actions, the agent must choose from the movement directions. Considering all this, the chosen action is to move south to (25,13), which is a floor, allowing further exploration.
