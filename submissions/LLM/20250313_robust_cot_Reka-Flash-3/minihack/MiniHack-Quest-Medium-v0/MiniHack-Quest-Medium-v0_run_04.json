The agent needs to attack it effectively. Since wielding the lance (b) might give a better reach or power, switching to it could help. Alternatively, moving closer to the rat would make attacking more effective.\n\nBut the agent is at (27,13), and the rat is adjacent east. So moving east once should place the agent next to the rat. Then attacking east would work. However, previous attempts to attack east didn't register, possibly due to action formatting. So the correct action now should be to move east first to get into range, then attack.\n\nAlternatively, if wielding the lance first would make the attack more effective, maybe that's a better step. So the sequence should be: wield b (to switch to the lance), then move east, then attack east.\n\nBut the agent needs to ensure that each action is properly formatted with the tags. Let me check the possible actions again. The allowed actions include 'wield', 'attack', 'move' directions, etc. The correct format for wielding is '<|ACTION|>wield b",
