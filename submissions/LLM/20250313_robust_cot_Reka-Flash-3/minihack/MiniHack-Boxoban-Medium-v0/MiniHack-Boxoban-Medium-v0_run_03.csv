Let's see. I need to figure out the best action for the agent in NetHack. The current observation shows the agent's inventory with a lot of items, but the main goal here is Boxoban-style gameplay, which is about pushing boulders onto fountains.

Looking at the message, it says ""Aloha Agent, welcome to NetHack!"" which is the standard start. The agent is a Tourist, neutral. The map isn't fully shown, but there's information about bars, dark areas, boulders, and fountains in different directions. The cursor is at position (35,10). 

The key elements to consider are the boulders and fountains. The problem statement mentions that the goal is to push boulders onto fountains. From the language observation, there are boulders and fountains in various directions. Specifically, the boulders are far eastsoutheast and near eastsoutheast. The fountains are far eastsoutheast and near east. 

The agent is currently at (35,10). Let's try to parse the map fragment provided. The map has a lot of empty spaces and some symbols. The line starting with #@`{..{..# might be relevant. The '#' represents walls, '.' are floors, '{' could be special tiles, maybe where the boulders or fountains are. The agent's position is marked with '@'.

The bars and dark areas indicate visibility limitations. The agent can't see everything. The closest boulder is adjacent to the east, as per the language observation: ""boulder adjacent east"". The fountain is adjacent northeast. So the immediate goal is probably to push the nearby boulder towards the adjacent northeast fountain. 

Since the boulder is adjacent east, the agent needs to move east to get next to it, then push it by moving in the direction opposite to where they want the boulder to go. But since the fountain is northeast of the agent's current position, maybe the boulder needs to be pushed northeast. Wait, the agent's position is (35,10). If the boulder is east (direction x increases), then pushing it northeast would mean moving northeast after positioning. But first, the agent needs to get next to the boulder.

So the agent's current position is (35,10). The boulder is adjacent east, so that would be (36,10). The fountain is adjacent northeast, which would be (36,9). If the boulder is at (36,10) and the fountain is at (36,9), the agent needs to push the boulder north to (36,9). How? The agent needs to move east to (36,10), then move north to push the boulder north into the fountain.

But wait, in NetHack, to push a boulder, you have to move into it from the opposite direction. So if the boulder is at (36,10), the agent needs to move east to (36,10), then move north. If there's a floor (.) north of (36,10), pushing the boulder north would place it at (36,9), which is the fountain. 

So the steps would be: move east to reach the boulder, then move north to push it onto the fountain. Let me check the map fragment again. The line with #@`{..{..# might have the agent's position as '@' followed by '{' which could be the boulder. The next line has ##..###`.# which could be walls preventing movement north beyond a certain point. Wait, maybe the fountain is adjacent northeast, so the agent is at (35,10), adjacent northeast is (35+1,10-1) = (36,9). The boulder is at (36,10). So moving east to (36,10), then moving north to (36,9) which is the fountain. 

But before moving east, the agent should check if there's a clear path. The map shows that to the east of the agent's position, there's a `{` in the first line after '@'. If that's a boulder, then moving east would place the agent next to it. Then moving north would push the boulder into the fountain. 

So the action sequence would be: east, then north. The problem says to output exactly one action, so the first action is east. But wait, the tip says not to repeat the same action if nothing changes. However, since the agent hasn't moved yet, moving east is the first step. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent is already adjacent to the boulder. Let me check the cursor position. The cursor is at (35,10). The language observation says ""boulder adjacent east"", so the boulder is at (36,10). The agent is at (35,10), so moving east once gets to (36,10). Then moving north would push the boulder to (36,9), the fountain. 

Therefore, the first action should be east to get next to the boulder. Then north to push it. But since the user is asking for the next action based on the current observation, the agent needs to move east first. 

But what if moving east is blocked? The map shows that in the first line after the agent's position, there's a `{` which might be a boulder. So moving east would hit the boulder, but in NetHack, you can walk into a boulder if you want to push it. Wait, no: to push a boulder, you move into it from behind. So if the agent is at (35,10) and moves east to (36,10), which is the boulder's position, that would not push it. To push, the agent needs to move into the boulder from the opposite direction. So the correct approach is to move east to be next to the boulder, then move north (or whatever direction towards the fountain). 

So the correct initial action is east. That's the first step. Then north. But since we can only output one action now, the first action is east. 

Therefore, the chosen action is east.

Let's see. I need to push the boulders onto the fountains. The goal is to get both boulders to the fountains. Let me check the current observation.

Looking at the map, the agent's position is (36,10). The boulders are mentioned as ""boulder near eastsoutheast and southeast"" and ""boulder very near eastsoutheast"". Also, there's a fountain adjacent to the east and another near the east.

The previous action was ""east"", which moved the agent to (36,10). Now the stairs up are adjacent west. The message area is empty, so no immediate messages.

I need to check where the boulders are and where the fountains are. The fountains are at eastsoutheast and east. The east fountain seems closer. Let me see the map again. The agent is facing east, so maybe the boulders are east of the agent. 

Looking at the map's ASCII representation, the agent is at the position marked with <@. Let's parse the map line by line. The map has several rows, but the relevant parts around the agent. The agent's row (y=10) is:

##.###...# 

But wait, the exact map might not be fully visible. However, the language observation mentions a boulder near eastsoutheast and southeast. The agent is at (36,10), so eastsoutheast would be to the southeast direction. The fountain is at eastsoutheast. So probably the boulder is in the way of reaching the fountain.

The goal is to push the boulder towards the fountain. Let me think about the path. If the agent moves east, there's a boulder there. So to push it, the agent needs to move into the boulder, which would push it if there's space behind. 

But first, where is the fountain? The fountain very near east. So east direction from the agent has a fountain. But there's a boulder adjacent east. So the boulder is right next to the agent's current position to the east. To push it towards the fountain, the agent needs to move east, but that would be into the boulder. Once pushed, the boulder would move east into the fountain, which is further east.

Wait, the agent is at (36,10). The boulder adjacent east would be at (37,10). The fountain is adjacent northeast. Wait, maybe the fountain is north of east? The language observation says ""fountain adjacent northeast"". Hmm, perhaps the map's coordinate system is a bit tricky. Alternatively, maybe the fountain is directly east, but the boulder is blocking it.

Looking at the previous observation, after moving east, the boulder is adjacent east. So if the agent moves east into the boulder, it would push it. If there's a space beyond the boulder, then the boulder would move there. The fountain is in the eastsoutheast direction, so perhaps after pushing the boulder east once, it can be pushed further towards the fountain.

Alternatively, maybe the east direction has the fountain. Let me check the language observations again. The current observation says ""fountain adjacent northeast"" and ""fountain very near east"". Wait, that's conflicting. Maybe the nearest fountain is east, but the agent is blocked by a boulder. So to reach the fountain, the agent needs to push the boulder out of the way.

So, the plan is: move east to push the boulder. But wait, the previous action was east, and the agent is now at (36,10), with the boulder adjacent east. So if the agent moves east again, they would step into the boulder, pushing it east. If there's an empty space east of the boulder, then that's good. Then the boulder would move east into the fountain.

Let me check the map's ASCII. The agent's current position is in a row that has ##.###...#. The agent is at position 36 (assuming each character is a cell). The next cell to the east (position 37) is a '.' which is an empty space, or maybe a wall? Wait, the map's row for y=10 is:

##.###...#

Breaking it down, each character is a cell. So positions 36 might be the '@' (agent), but in the current map, it's shown as ""<@`..{..#"". Wait, the actual map might be different. Maybe I'm confusing the map. Let me try to parse the map again.

The map provided in the current observation is very sparse. Most of the lines are empty. The relevant line for the agent is the one with the agent's position:

#<@`..{..# 

Wait, maybe the agent is at the '<' symbol here? Or the '@'? Let me check. The cursor says (x=36, y=10). Each line in the map is a row. Let's assume each character in the row is a cell. The row for y=10 is:

#<@`..{..#

Breaking it down:

0: #
1: <
2: @
3: `
4: .
5: .
6: {
7: .
8: .
9: #

So the agent is at position 2 (x=2?), but the cursor says x=36. Hmm, this might be a formatting issue. The actual map might be much larger, but the displayed part is truncated. Alternatively, perhaps the agent is in the middle of a larger grid, but the visible part here is limited.

Given the confusion, perhaps it's better to rely on the language observations. The current boulders are near eastsoutheast and southeast, and the fountains are at eastsoutheast and east. The agent is at (36,10). So moving east would take the agent towards the boulder. The goal is to push that boulder towards the fountain that's east.

So the action should be to push the boulder by moving east. If the agent moves east, they will be next to the boulder. Since the boulder can be pushed if there's space behind, the agent needs to move into the boulder's position. That would push the boulder one cell east. If that cell is empty or has a fountain, then it's successful.

Looking at the language observation, after moving east, the bars and dark areas are updated, but the boulder is still adjacent east. So the space beyond the boulder must be occupied. Therefore, pushing the boulder east once might not be enough. Alternatively, maybe the boulder is two cells away from the fountain.

Alternatively, maybe there's another boulder further east. The agent needs to navigate around it. But according to the current observation, there's a boulder very near eastsoutheast. So perhaps after pushing the first boulder east, the agent can move past it and then push another boulder.

But the immediate task is to interact with the boulder adjacent east. So the next action is to move east again to push it. However, the tip says not to repeat the same action if nothing changes. The previous action was east, and the agent moved there. Now, moving east again would push the boulder. Let's confirm.

In Boxoban, to push a boulder, the agent must move into it, and the space behind the boulder must be empty. So if the agent is at (36,10) and moves east to (37,10), which is the boulder, then the agent would push the boulder to (38,10), provided that (38,10) is walkable (not a wall or another obstacle).

The language observation mentions ""bars very near north, northnortheast, northeast, southeast, southsouthwest, southwest, westsouthwest, west, westnorthwest, northwest, and northnorthwest"". So maybe those are walls or barriers. The boulder very near eastsoutheast suggests that after pushing, the boulder would move towards eastsoutheast, which is where the fountain is.

So the action should be east again to push the boulder. However, after the previous east action, the agent is now at (36,10), and the boulder is adjacent east. So moving east again would push it.

Alternatively, maybe the agent should move south or another direction to reposition. But given the immediate goal, pushing the boulder east seems logical.

So the chosen action is east.

2,east,"<reasoning>
The agent has moved east three times so far. The current position is (37, 10). The map shows some structures with symbols like @, <, {, and #. The cursor is on 'St' which probably stands for stats.

Looking at the observations, there's a boulder adjacent to the east and southeast. The fountain is adjacent to the northwest. The stairs up are very near the west. The agent's current inventory includes a blessed potion of extra healing and other items, but I don't see any boxes (boulders) that need to be pushed yet. Wait, the problem is Boxoban, so the goal is to push boulders onto fountains.

In the previous steps, moving east three times has brought the agent closer to the eastern parts. Now, there's a boulder adjacent east, so pushing it east might move it towards a fountain. The fountain is adjacent northwest, but that's not in the direction of the boulder. Alternatively, maybe the boulder is near eastsoutheast, so pushing it southeast could get it to the fountain there.

Wait, the boulder adjacent east and southeast. So if the agent is at (37,10), then east would take them to (38,10), but there's a boulder there. To push the boulder, the agent needs to move into it, which would push the boulder one tile in the same direction. So if the agent moves east (into the boulder at (38,10)), that would push the boulder to (39,10). Then, the fountain is at eastsoutheast, which might be (39,11) or similar. But I need to check the map.

Looking at the map, the current position is marked as '<.@`.{..#'. The '@' is the agent. The '.'s and '{' might represent different floor tiles or features. The fountain is adjacent northwest, which would be (36,9) perhaps? But the boulder is adjacent east and southeast, so maybe at (38,10) and (37,11). The fountain near eastsoutheast might be at (39,11). So if the agent can push the boulder from (38,10) to (39,10), then maybe the next move is to push it further southeast to (39,11) where the fountain is.

So the plan is: move east to push the boulder at (38,10) to (39,10), then move southeast to push it to (39,11). Alternatively, after pushing east, the agent might need to move southeast to position themselves to push again.

But first, the agent is at (37,10). The boulder is adjacent east (38,10). So moving east would push that boulder east. Then, from (38,10) after pushing, the agent could move southeast to (38,11), and then push the boulder again to (39,11), which is the fountain.

Alternatively, maybe the agent should move south to get into position. But the immediate next step is to push the east boulder. So the action should be 'east' to push the boulder. But wait, the previous actions were 'east' three times. The tip says to avoid repeating the same action if nothing changes. However, in this case, each 'east' movement is progressing the agent closer and interacting with the boulder.

Alternatively, the agent could move south to get a better angle to push the boulder southeast. But given the current position and the boulder's location, pushing it east first might be more straightforward. Let's proceed with 'east' to push the boulder. But after pushing, the boulder moves, and the agent might need to follow up with another direction.

So the next action would be 'east' to push the boulder from (38,10) to (39,10). Then, perhaps 'southeast' to position the agent to push it further. But the agent needs to be adjacent to the boulder again. After pushing east, the agent would be at (38,10), and the boulder at (39,10). Then moving southeast to (38,11) would place the agent north of the boulder at (39,10), allowing a push south to (39,11). Alternatively, moving south to (38,11) and then pushing southeast. Hmm, this might take a few steps.

But based on the current observation, the immediate next step is to push the eastern boulder. So the chosen action is 'east'.

Let's see. I need to figure out the best move for the agent in this Boxoban-like game. The goal is to push boulders onto fountains.

Looking at the current observations, the agent is at position (38, 10). The map shows that there's a boulder adjacent to the east and south. The fountains are near east and westnorthwest. Also, there's a staircase up near the west. 

Wait, the previous actions were moving east three times. The map seems to have some structure. Let me parse the language observations again. The boulders are near eastsoutheast and southsoutheast. The fountains are in the eastsoutheast and westnorthwest directions. 

The agent is facing east now. To the east is a boulder adjacent. If I try to move east again, I might get stuck because there's a boulder there. Alternatively, moving south could allow pushing the boulder from the south. But wait, the boulder is adjacent east and south. So the boulder to the east is right next to the agent. 

If the agent moves east, they would be next to the boulder. Since the boulder is adjacent, maybe the agent can push it eastward. But the problem is whether there's space behind the boulder. If moving east from the agent's current position (38,10) into the boulder's space (39,10), then pushing would require the space east of that (40,10) to be clear. The map doesn't show any obstacles there, but there's a fountain very near the westnorthwest, which might be in the opposite direction. 

Alternatively, moving south might be better. If the agent moves south to (38,11), then if there's a boulder to the south (adjacent south), the agent could push it south. But I need to check the map again. The cursor is at (38,10). The map shows a '<' symbol there, which is the agent. The next position to the east (39,10) has a '@' which might be the boulder. So if the agent tries to move east into (39,10), which has a boulder, then pushing it would require the space beyond (40,10) to be free. If that's clear, then pushing east would move the boulder. 

But the message mentions that the boulder adjacent east. So the agent is next to the boulder, and can push it. The question is whether the path is clear. Since the map shows a '.' in the direction beyond the boulder (assuming standard Boxoban tiles), maybe it's possible. 

Alternatively, moving south might let the agent navigate around and find a path to the fountains. Let me check the fountain locations. The fountains are very near east and westnorthwest. The agent is on the east side of the map, so pushing the boulder east towards the fountain in the eastsoutheast direction might be the way to go. 

Wait, the boulder near eastsoutheast is adjacent to the agent's current position. If the agent pushes it east, it would go towards the fountain. So moving east and then pushing the boulder east again. However, in the current observation, the boulder is adjacent east. So the agent can push it by moving into it. 

So the next action should be to move east into the boulder, which would push it east. That would move the boulder closer to the fountain. Then, after that, the agent can continue pushing or move in another direction. 

Alternatively, if moving east is blocked by the boulder, the agent might need to move south to position (38,11) and check if there's a path. The map shows a '{' in the southeast direction, but I'm not sure. The language observations mention bars and dark areas, which might be walls or other obstructions. 

Another thing to consider is the staircase up near the west. The agent is on the first level, and stairs up are west of the agent. But the goal is to push boulders, so perhaps the stairs are not immediately necessary. 

So the best immediate action is to push the boulder east. To do that, the agent needs to move east into the boulder's position. Therefore, the next action should be 'east'. But wait, the agent already moved east three times. The tip says not to repeat the same action unless something changes. However, in the previous steps, moving east three times got the agent to (38,10), and the boulder is now adjacent. So moving east again would push the boulder. 

Yes, that makes sense. The agent should move east to push the boulder towards the fountain. Let's confirm the map. The agent is at (38,10), the boulder is at (39,10). Moving east into (39,10) would push it to (40,10), which should be a valid space since there's no mention of obstacles there. 

Therefore, the chosen action is 'east'.

Let's see. The agent is in a Boxoban-like environment, trying to push boulders onto fountains. The goal is to move them correctly without getting stuck. Looking at the latest observation, the agent is at (x=39, y=10). The map shows a series of walls and possibly some areas where the boulders and fountains are.

From the previous moves, the agent has been moving east repeatedly. The map shows a boulder adjacent to the east and southwest. The fountain is adjacent to the west. So right now, the agent is next to a boulder. The key here is to determine if the boulder can be pushed. Since the agent is trying to push the boulders onto fountains, the goal would be to move the boulder towards the fountain.

Looking at the current position, the boulder is adjacent east. If the agent moves east, they would be next to the boulder. But moving east again might just push the boulder further east, which might not be the right direction. The fountain is adjacent west, so pushing the boulder west towards the fountain would be better. However, to push the boulder west, the agent needs to be on the west side of the boulder. 

Wait, the boulder is adjacent east. So the agent is facing east, next to the boulder. To push the boulder west, the agent needs to walk into it from the east, which would push it west. But then the agent would end up where the boulder was. Alternatively, maybe moving south or another direction could allow positioning. However, the observations mention bars and dark areas in certain directions, which might be walls or obstacles.

Looking at the ""bars adjacent north, northeast, and southeast,"" those could be walls. So the agent can't move in those directions. The only possible moves might be south, west, or maybe east again. But moving east again would just push the boulder further east, away from the fountain. 

The fountain is adjacent west, so perhaps the correct move is to push the boulder west. To do that, the agent needs to be in the position to push it. Since the boulder is adjacent east, the agent can move south or perhaps west to get behind it. Wait, the agent is at (39,10). Moving west would take them to (38,10), which is adjacent to the boulder. Then, moving west again would push the boulder to (37,10). But the fountain is adjacent west, which is (38,10) perhaps? Let me check the map again.

The map shows at position (38,10) there's a `{.@`... which might indicate a boulder and fountain nearby. Wait, the map is a bit unclear. Let me parse the map line by line. The agent's position is (39,10). The map's 10th line (assuming y=10 is the 10th line) is:

#<.{.@`..# 

Breaking this down, each character represents a tile. The agent is at position (39, y=10), which corresponds to the character at index 39 in this line. The line is:

0: # 
1: <
2: .
3: {
4: .
5: @
6: `
7: .
8: .
9: #

Wait, maybe the map's x coordinates go from left to right, and the lines are from top to bottom. The agent's position is (x=39, y=10), so in the 10th line of the map (assuming y=1 is the first line at the top), the 39th character. Looking at the line for y=10:

##{..##..#                                    
But the actual line provided is: #<.{.@`..# 

Assuming each line is 40 characters long (since the map has several lines with 40 characters each). Let's count the characters in the line:

The line starts with '#', then '<', '.', '{', '.', '@', '`', '.', '.', '#', etc. Wait, the line given is:

#<.{.@`..# 

Breaking it down:

0: #
1: <
2: .
3: {
4: .
5: @
6: `
7: .
8: .
9: .
10: #
... and so on. Wait, maybe the exact positions are a bit off. Alternatively, perhaps the agent is at position (39,10), and the adjacent tiles are:

To the west (x=38, y=10): the character is '{', which might be a boulder or another obstacle. The agent's current position has '@' which is themselves. To the east (x=40, y=10): the character is '.' which is a floor. To the north (y=9, x=39): the line is '#######..#', so the 39th character there is '.'. To the south (y=11, x=39): the line is similar, perhaps another floor.

But the main thing is the boulder adjacent east. The boulder is at (40,10), which is the next tile to the east. To push it west, the agent needs to move into it. So from (39,10), moving east to (40,10) would push the boulder to (41,10). But that's moving the boulder away from the fountain. The fountain is adjacent west, which might be at (38,10) or somewhere else. 

Looking at the language observation, there's a fountain adjacent west. So the fountain is next to the agent's current position west. Wait, the agent is at (39,10). Adjacent west would be (38,10). The map shows at (38,10) there's a '{' which might be a boulder. So the fountain is adjacent west, but there's a boulder blocking the way. The goal is to push the boulder onto the fountain. 

So the plan is to move the boulder from (40,10) to (38,10), which is the position of the fountain. To do that, the agent needs to navigate around. Since the agent is at (39,10), they can move west to (38,10), which is a '{', perhaps a boulder. Then, moving west again would push the boulder to (37,10). But the fountain is at (38,10), so pushing the boulder there would place it on the fountain. 

Wait, but the current boulder is at (40,10). To get it to (38,10), the agent needs to move west twice: first to (38,10) which is the boulder, then pushing it to (37,10). But the agent's goal is to get the boulder onto the fountain at (38,10). However, the fountain is adjacent west, which is (38,10). So if the boulder is moved there, that's the solution. 

But how to do that? The agent is at (39,10). To push the boulder at (40,10) west, the agent needs to move east into it, pushing it to (41,10). That's not helpful. Alternatively, the agent could move west to (38,10), which is the boulder, then move west again to push it to (37,10). But the fountain is at (38,10), so the boulder can't be there because it's occupied by the boulder. Wait, maybe the fountain is at (38,9) or another coordinate. 

This is getting a bit confusing. Let me recheck the language observations. The latest observation says:

fountain adjacent west

So the fountain is next to the agent's current position west. The agent is at (39,10). Adjacent west is (38,10). The map shows at (38,10) a '{', which might be a boulder. So to place the boulder on the fountain, the agent needs to move the boulder from (40,10) to (38,10). But (38,10) is occupied by another boulder or an obstacle. Wait, the language observation mentions a boulder near eastsoutheast and southsoutheast, and a boulder adjacent east and southwest. Adjacent east is (40,10), which is the boulder we're looking at. Adjacent southwest is (39,9), perhaps. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent should move south to find a better path. The bars adjacent north, northeast, and southeast might block movement in those directions. The agent's current position has bars adjacent north, northeast, and southeast, meaning walls there. So movement north, northeast, or southeast is not possible. The possible moves are south, west, or east. 

But moving east again would push the boulder further, which isn't helpful. Moving west to (38,10) is the boulder. Then, moving west again from there would push it to (37,10). But the fountain is at (38,10), so perhaps that's the target. However, there's already a boulder there. Maybe there's another boulder that needs to be moved. 

Wait, the language observation says ""boulder adjacent east and southwest"". Adjacent east is (40,10), adjacent southwest is (39,9). Maybe there are multiple boulders. The agent's goal is to push all boulders to fountains. 

Alternatively, perhaps the agent should first move south to a position where they can push the boulder in a more strategic direction. Let's check the map again. The agent's y=10 line is #<.{.@`..#. So moving south to y=11, x=39. The map for y=11 is similar: #######..#, so the 39th character is '.'. So moving south is possible. 

If the agent moves south to (39,11), then they can look around. Maybe from there, they can push the boulder west. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, moving west to (38,10) which is a boulder, then trying to push it west. But the agent needs to be on the same row or column. 

Wait, to push a boulder, the agent must move into it, which then moves the boulder one tile in the direction the agent is coming from. So if the agent is at (39,10) and moves east to (40,10), which is the boulder, the boulder would move to (41,10). But that's not helpful. 

Alternatively, if the agent moves west to (38,10), which is the boulder, then the boulder would move to (37,10). Then, the agent can move further west to (37,10), now that the boulder is there. But the fountain is at (38,10), so pushing the boulder there would solve the problem. 

Wait, but the agent is at (39,10). If they move west to (38,10) (the boulder), then the boulder moves to (37,10). Then, the agent is at (38,10), which was the fountain's position? No, the fountain is adjacent west, which is (38,10). So if the boulder is moved there, that's the target. But currently, (38,10) has a boulder (the one the agent is moving into). So perhaps there's another boulder that needs to be moved out of the way. 

This is getting complicated. Maybe the best immediate action is to try to push the boulder west. So from (39,10), move west into the boulder at (38,10), which would push it to (37,10). This might open up a path or allow further movement. Alternatively, moving south could provide a better vantage point. 

Looking at the inventory, the agent has a blessed potion of extra healing and some other items, but that's probably not relevant here. The key is to push the boulder towards the fountain. 

Another possibility is that the agent is next to a boulder that can be pushed west into the fountain. However, based on the map, the fountain is at (38,10), which is occupied by a boulder. So perhaps there's another fountain elsewhere. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent should check other directions. The bars adjacent north, northeast, and southeast suggest walls, so moving in those directions isn't possible. The only viable moves are south, west, or east. 

Given that moving east just pushes the boulder further, which isn't helpful, the better option is to move west into the boulder, pushing it to (37,10). This could allow the agent to then move west again to the fountain's location. But I'm not sure if that's the case. 

Alternatively, the agent could move south to y=11, x=39, which is a floor ('.'), and then look for a way to reposition the boulder. 

Considering all this, the safest immediate action is to try pushing the boulder west by moving west into it. So the agent should move west.

The agent is moving east step by step. The goal is to push the boulder onto the fountain. Let's look at the current situation.

The agent is at (38,10). The previous move was west, bringing them back to x=38. The map shows that there's a boulder adjacent to the east (x=39, y=10) and a fountain adjacent to the west. The stairs up are near the west, so maybe there's an exit there, but the priority is pushing the boulder.

The language observations mention a boulder very near east (at x=39, y=10). To push it west, the agent needs to move into the boulder's position. So moving east again could work, but after moving west once, maybe the boulder is now adjacent. Wait, the last message said ""boulder adjacent east"" when the agent was at x=38. So if the agent moves east to x=39, they can push the boulder west to x=38. Then the boulder would be on the cell where the agent is now, and the fountain is at x=37, y=10 (fountain adjacent west). Wait, the fountain's position needs to be checked. The language observation says ""fountain adjacent west"", so when the agent is at x=38, west would be x=37. If the boulder is pushed to x=38, then it's on the same cell as the agent, which isn't possible. Wait, maybe the fountain is at x=37, so pushing the boulder to x=38 would place it next to the fountain. Let me check the map again. The map shows the agent at x=38, and the previous step had a boulder at x=39, adjacent east. If the agent moves east to x=39, then they can push the boulder west to x=38. Then the boulder would be at x=38, which is where the agent is now. That can't be, so maybe after pushing, the agent needs to move again. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to move east into the boulder and push it west. So the sequence would be: move east to x=39 (into the boulder), then push it west. But in the current state, the boulder is adjacent east, so moving east would be possible if there's space behind it. The observation mentions ""boulder adjacent east"", so the cell to the east (x=39) has the boulder. To push it, the agent needs to move east into the boulder and then there must be a space behind it to push. The map shows that at x=39, y=10, there's a boulder, so moving east into it. Then, the cell behind the boulder (x=40) would need to be a walkable space. But looking at the map, the next cells after x=39 are part of the walls (since the map's right side has ##########). So maybe the boulder is stuck against a wall. Wait, the map shows at x=39, the cell is `{.@.`..#`, which might have a wall or obstacle. So perhaps the boulder can't be pushed further east because there's a wall. Therefore, the agent should instead move west to get the boulder into a position where it can be pushed towards the fountain.

But the agent was just at x=38 after moving west. The fountain is adjacent west (x=37). The boulder is at x=39. So the path from x=38 to x=39 is the boulder. To push it west, the agent needs to move east into the boulder, then the boulder moves west to x=38. But if there's a wall at x=38's east (which there isn't, since the agent is there), but in this case, after moving east to x=39, pushing the boulder west would place it at x=38, which is where the agent is. That's not possible. So perhaps the agent needs to move around. Alternatively, check if the boulder is at x=39 and the fountain at x=37. So the agent needs to push the boulder two cells west. Maybe the agent should move east into the boulder, push it west to x=38, then move west again to x=37, and then the boulder is at x=38. But that doesn't place it on the fountain at x=37. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the boulder can be pushed all the way to the fountain. Let's see. If the boulder is at x=39, and the agent pushes it west three times: once to x=38, then the agent moves west to x=37, pushes it again to x=36, etc., until it reaches the fountain. But given the map's structure, there might be walls blocking that path. The map's right side has walls (##########), so pushing east beyond x=39 is blocked. Therefore, the boulder can only be pushed west. So the agent needs to get between the boulder and the fountain. Maybe the agent should move west to x=37, then push the boulder from x=38 to x=37. But the agent is currently at x=38. So moving west to x=37, then moving east into the boulder at x=38, pushing it west to x=37. That would place the boulder on top of the fountain at x=37. That makes sense. So the steps would be: move west to x=37, then move east to x=38 (into the boulder), pushing it west to x=37. Then the boulder is on the fountain. But in the current observation, after moving west to x=38, the boulder is adjacent east (x=39). So the agent needs to first move west to x=37, then move east into x=38 (the boulder's current position), which would push it to x=37. That way, the boulder is on the fountain. But in the current state, the agent is at x=38. Let me check the language observations again. The boulder is very near east (x=39), and the fountain is very near west (x=37). So the agent is in the middle. To push the boulder west, the agent needs to move into it. So the next action should be east, moving to x=39, then push it west. But after moving east, the agent would be at x=39, next to the boulder. Then, if the cell behind the boulder (x=40) is walkable, the agent can push it. However, the map shows that beyond x=39, there's a wall (##########), so pushing the boulder east is impossible. Therefore, the only way is to push it west. So when the agent is at x=39, they can push the boulder west to x=38. But then the boulder would be at x=38, and the agent is at x=39. Then the agent needs to move west to x=38 to get next to the boulder again, but that's redundant. Alternatively, after pushing the boulder to x=38, the agent can move west to x=37, which is where the fountain is. Then the boulder at x=38 is adjacent to the fountain at x=37. But the goal is to have the boulder on the fountain. So perhaps the agent needs to push it one more step west. But x=37 is the fountain. So moving the boulder to x=37 would place it on the fountain. How to do that? The agent would need to be at x=38, then move east into the boulder at x=39, pushing it to x=38. Then the agent is at x=39. Then move west to x=38, then again move east into the boulder at x=38 (now moved to x=38?), no. This is getting confusing. Let's think step by step.

Current position: x=38, y=10.

Boulder is at x=39, y=10.

Fountain is at x=37, y=10.

To push the boulder to the fountain at x=37, the agent needs to move it two cells west.

Step 1: Agent moves east to x=39 (onto the boulder).

Step 2: Push the boulder west to x=38. Now the boulder is at x=38, agent is at x=39.

Step 3: Agent moves west to x=38 (now adjacent to the boulder at x=38).

But this doesn't help. Alternatively, after step 2, the boulder is at x=38. The agent is at x=39. To push it again, the agent needs to move east into x=38 (the boulder's new position), but that's not possible because the agent is at x=39. So this approach isn't working.

Alternative approach: Agent moves west to x=37 (next to the fountain), then moves east into the boulder at x=38, pushing it to x=37 (onto the fountain).

So steps:

1. Move west from x=38 to x=37.

2. Move east into x=38 (boulder is there), pushing it to x=37.

This would place the boulder on the fountain.

But in the current observation, after moving west to x=38, the boulder is at x=39. So the agent is at x=38, and the boulder is at x=39. So to get the agent next to the boulder, they need to move east again. But moving east would take them to x=39, where the boulder is. Then pushing it west to x=38. Then the agent is at x=39, boulder at x=38. Then the agent moves west to x=38, then east again into the boulder at x=38? No, that's not possible. Wait, maybe the agent should move east into the boulder, push it west, then move west to get next to the new boulder position, and push again.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is:

Agent is at x=38, boulder at x=39.

Move east to x=39 (onto the boulder).

Push west to x=38. Now boulder is at x=38, agent at x=39.

Then move west to x=38 (adjacent to the boulder).

But then the boulder is already at x=38, so pushing again isn't possible unless there's space behind. There's a wall at x=38's east (the agent is there), but the cell behind the boulder (x=37) is the fountain.

Wait, if the boulder is at x=38, and the agent is at x=39, then the agent can't push the boulder further west because the cell x=37 is the fountain. So pushing the boulder from x=38 to x=37 would place it on the fountain. But how?

The agent needs to be adjacent to the boulder to push it. So after moving the boulder to x=38, the agent is at x=39. Then the agent needs to move west to x=38, then move east into the boulder at x=38, pushing it to x=37. But that would require the agent to be at x=38, then move east into the boulder, which is possible if there's space behind it (x=37). But x=37 is the fountain, which is a target cell. In Boxoban, pushing a boulder onto a fountain is the goal. So when the agent pushes the boulder onto the fountain, that's a success.

So the steps would be:

1. Agent at x=38, moves east to x=39 (onto the boulder).

2. Push the boulder west to x=38. Now agent is at x=39, boulder at x=38.

3. Agent moves west to x=38 (adjacent to the boulder).

4. Push the boulder west again to x=37 (onto the fountain).

This would solve the problem.

But in the current observation, after the agent moved west to x=38, the boulder is adjacent east (x=39). So the agent is at x=38, and the boulder is at x=39. So the next step is to move east to x=39, then push the boulder west to x=38. Then, move west to x=38, then move east into the boulder at x=38, pushing it to x=37.

But the agent's current position is x=38. The action needed now is to move east to x=39, which is the boulder's position. That's the correct first step. Then, when the agent is at x=39, they can push the boulder west. However, in the game's mechanics, when you move into a boulder, it automatically pushes it if there's space behind. So if the agent moves east into x=39 (the boulder), and the cell behind (x=40) is a wall, then the push isn't possible. But in this case, the cell behind the boulder (x=40) is part of the map's right wall (####...), so it's blocked. Therefore, the agent cannot push the boulder east, but can push it west.

Wait, when the agent is at x=39 and moves east into the boulder, the boulder would try to move east into x=40. But since x=40 is a wall, the push fails. Therefore, the agent can only push the boulder west. So moving into the boulder from the east (x=39) and then pushing west to x=38. That would work. Then the boulder is at x=38, and the agent is at x=39. Then the agent moves west to x=38, which is now next to the boulder. Then, the agent can push the boulder west again to x=37, which is the fountain. But to do that, the agent needs to move into the boulder at x=38, pushing it to x=37. Since x=37 is the fountain, that's the goal.

So the sequence of actions would be:

east (to x=39), then another east (but that's into the boulder, which would push it west to x=38). Then west to x=38, then east again to push to x=37.

But in the current observation, after moving west to x=38, the next step is to move east to x=39 (the boulder). So the correct action now is east.

Let's see. The agent has been moving east multiple times, but now it's at (39, 10) and moving east again brings it to (40, 10). However, looking at the map and observations, there's a boulder adjacent to the east and southwest. The previous steps show that moving east leads to being adjacent to a boulder. The goal in Boxoban is to push boulders onto fountains. The current position has a boulder near eastsoutheast and southsoutheast, and a fountain near southeast.

The agent needs to push the boulder onto the fountain. Since the boulder is adjacent east and southwest, maybe moving south first could position to push the boulder south onto the fountain. Alternatively, moving east and then pushing the boulder south. But moving east again might get the agent stuck next to the boulder. Let's check the latest observation: boulder adjacent east and southwest. So the boulder is east of the agent's current position. If the agent moves east, they would be next to the boulder. Then, pushing it south (by moving into it while there's space behind) would move the boulder south towards the fountain. 

The available actions are north, east, south, west. The agent is at (39,10). If they move east to (40,10), they are next to the boulder. Then, pushing the boulder would require moving south into it, which would push the boulder to (40,11). Then, moving south again to (40,12) to check if the boulder is on the fountain. Alternatively, maybe moving south first from (39,10) to (39,11) could allow a better approach. Wait, the boulder is adjacent east and southwest. The southwest of the boulder would be (39,9), which is where the agent is not. So the boulder is at (40,10) east of the agent. To push it south, the agent needs to be next to it and move south. So first move east to (40,10), then move south to push it to (40,11). Then check if (40,11) is a fountain. From the observations, there's a fountain near southeast. The exact position might be (40,11) if that's a fountain. 

Alternatively, the agent could move south first, then east. But moving south from (39,10) to (39,11), then east to (40,11), which is where the boulder would be pushed if pushed from the east. But the current boulder is at (40,10), so pushing it south from there would go to (40,11). If that's a fountain, then that's the goal. 

So the sequence would be: move east to (40,10), then move south to push the boulder to (40,11). Then verify if that's a fountain. Looking at the language observations, there's a fountain near southeast. The very near fountain is westnorthwest, which might not be the case. Wait, the latest observation says ""fountain very near westnorthwest"". Hmm, maybe the fountain is in a different direction. Alternatively, the boulder at (40,10) when pushed south to (40,11) could be onto a fountain. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent should check the map again. The map shows at position (40,10) there's a `<.{.@`..#` part. Wait, the map in the current observation shows the agent's position at (39,10) as `#<.{.@`..#`, so the boulder is probably in the next cell east. To interact with it, the agent needs to move east and then push. 

So the next action should be east to get next to the boulder, then south to push it onto the fountain. But the user is asking for the next action, which is the first step. So the immediate action is to move east to (40,10) to be adjacent to the boulder. Then, the next step would be to push it south. But since the user is asking for the next action based on the current observation, which is at (39,10) with the boulder adjacent east, the correct action is to move east. But wait, the agent already tried moving east multiple times and then west. Maybe there's a better path. Alternatively, moving south first to position to push the boulder into a better spot. 

Wait, the current position (39,10) has a boulder adjacent east (at 40,10). The agent is at (39,10). If the agent moves east to (40,10), they can then push the boulder south. So the next action is east. However, in the previous steps, moving east multiple times didn't change the state much. The tip says to avoid repeating the same action if nothing changes. But in this case, moving east is necessary to reach the boulder. So the correct action is east to get next to the boulder, then south to push it. 

But the user is asking for the next action right now, based on the last observation where the agent is at (39,10) and the boulder is adjacent east. So the immediate action to take is east to position next to the boulder. Then, the next action would be south to push it. But since the user wants the next action to output, it's east. However, maybe there's a fountain in the south direction. Let me check the language observations again. The fountain near southeast. If pushing the boulder south from (40,10) to (40,11) lands it on a fountain, that's the goal. So moving east first is necessary. 

Therefore, the chosen action is east.

The agent is in a Boxoban-like environment trying to push boulders onto fountains. The goal is to navigate and manipulate the environment effectively.

Looking at the map, the agent's current position is (40, 10). The most recent action was moving east, and the observation shows that there's a boulder adjacent to the east. The message indicates that the agent successfully moved the boulder, which is a good sign.

The language observations mention fountains near the southeast, west, and westnorthwest. The agent needs to get the boulder onto a fountain. The current boulder is near southsoutheast, but there's a fountain nearby. Since the agent just moved the boulder, it's probably in a new position. The map shows that the boulder was at (40,10) before moving east, but after moving, it's likely now at (41,10), which is east of the agent.

Wait, no. When the agent moves east into a boulder, the boulder should move east as well. So if the agent is at (40,10) and moves east, the boulder that was there would move to (41,10). But in the current observation, the boulder is adjacent east, meaning it's now at (41,10). The agent is at (40,10), and the boulder is to the east. 

The fountain is near southsoutheast. The agent needs to get the boulder to that fountain. The current position of the boulder is east of the agent. To push it further east, the agent can move east again. But the problem is that there might be obstacles. The map shows some bars and dark areas, which are likely walls or blocked paths. The agent needs to check if moving the boulder east is possible.

The bars very near north, northeast, etc., might indicate walls. The agent is at (40,10), and trying to move the boulder east (41,10). If there's a wall there, the agent can't push. But based on the current map, the line for y=10 at x=41 shows a '.' which is a floor, so it should be possible. 

The message after moving east says the boulder was moved, so the path must be clear. Now, to get the boulder onto the fountain, the agent should continue pushing it east until it reaches the fountain. Since the fountain is near southsoutheast, maybe the boulder needs to be moved further east or southeast. However, the immediate target is the fountain near eastsoutheast. 

Alternatively, the agent might need to position the boulder closer to the fountain. Since the current boulder is at (41,10), moving it east again would take it to (42,10), but perhaps there's a diagonal path to the southeast. The agent could move southeast to push the boulder that way. However, the agent's current position is (40,10), and moving southeast would take them to (41,11). If there's a floor there, they could push the boulder diagonally. 

Looking at the map, the lines for y=11 at x=41 might have a '.' or a wall. The map provided doesn't show the exact cells beyond the current view, but the language observations mention that there are bars very near north, northeast, etc. So maybe moving east again is safe. 

Another consideration is that pushing the boulder multiple times might be necessary. The agent's previous actions were moving east multiple times, which suggests that the boulder is being pushed in that direction. If the fountain is east of the current boulder position, continuing to push east would be the way to go. 

Alternatively, after pushing the boulder east once, the agent might need to reposition to push it further. But given the current observations, the immediate next step is probably to continue moving east to push the boulder towards the fountain. 

So the chosen action should be 'east' again to push the boulder further east towards the fountain.

The goal is to push the boulder onto the fountain in Boxoban. Let's analyze the current situation.

From the observations, the agent is at position (41, 10). There's a boulder adjacent to the east (east of the agent's current position). The map shows that moving east would take the agent towards the boulder. The fountain is near westnorthwest, so we need to get the boulder towards there.

In the last move, pushing the boulder to the east succeeded, moving it from (40,10) to (41,10). Now, the agent is at (41,10) with the boulder now at (42,10) or wherever it was pushed. Wait, the message after the last action was ""With great effort you move the boulder."" So the boulder was pushed east, so it's now at (40,10) + east direction. Wait, the agent was at (40,10) and moved east to (41,10), pushing the boulder there. So the boulder is now at (41,10). But now the agent is at (41,10), and the boulder is adjacent east again because moving east again would push it further.

Looking at the current map, the boulder is adjacent east. The agent is at (41,10). So to continue pushing the boulder towards the fountain, which is westnorthwest direction, the agent should keep moving east until the boulder is in a position where the agent can move it towards the fountain.

Wait, the fountain is near westnorthwest, which is up and west. But the boulder needs to be pushed to a southeast position? Or maybe the fountain is in a specific tile. Let me check the language observations again.

The language observation says: fountain near southsoutheast, west, and westnorthwest. So the fountain is in southsoutheast, west, and westnorthwest areas. Wait, that seems conflicting. Maybe it's a nearby fountain in the southsoutheast direction. The agent's current position is (41,10). The boulder is adjacent east. If the agent moves east again, they can push the boulder further east. But the fountain is southsoutheast. That's not directly in the path. Maybe the agent needs to move the boulder in a different direction.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct path is to push the boulder south or southeast. But based on the map, the agent is near the eastern edge, so moving south might not be possible due to walls (as indicated by the ########## in the map borders). The agent is in a corridor that's going east-west. The map shows that to the east, there are walls (#) after the boulder. So pushing the boulder east further might be blocked by walls. Therefore, the agent should change direction to south or north to get the boulder towards the fountain.

Wait, the fountain is near southsoutheast. So the agent needs to move the boulder south and east. But the agent is currently at (41,10), and moving east would hit a wall if they continue. Let me check the map again. The map shows at position (41,10) there's a `{..{@`#`, so the agent's position is at a floor tile with some symbols. The east direction from here would be into a `#` which is a wall. So the agent cannot move east anymore because the next cell is a wall. Therefore, the boulder is adjacent east (in cell (42,10)), but that cell is a wall, so the agent can't push it further east. That means the agent needs to move in another direction to position the boulder towards the fountain.

So the options are to move south, north, west, or try to push the boulder in a different direction. But since moving east is blocked, the agent needs to adjust. Let's see the possible moves:

- Moving south (y increases) from (41,10) to (41,11). Is that possible? The map's lower part isn't shown, but assuming the dungeon is finite, moving south might lead to another floor tile. The language observation mentions a dark area near north and northeast, but not specifically south. The bars are very near north, so maybe moving south is feasible.

Alternatively, moving west to (40,10) to perhaps reposition. But the boulder is currently at (41,10) (since the agent pushed it there earlier). Wait, the last action was moving east, pushing the boulder from (40,10) to (41,10). So now the agent is at (41,10), and the boulder is at (41,10)? Wait, no—when you push a boulder, you move into the boulder's tile, and it moves into the tile behind it. So if the agent was at (40,10) and pushed east, they move to (41,10), and the boulder from (41,10) moves to (42,10). But if (42,10) is a wall, then the push isn't possible. However, in the last observation, the message was that the boulder was moved, so it must have been possible. Therefore, (42,10) is a floor tile, not a wall.

But now, the agent is at (41,10), and the boulder is at (42,10). The next cell east (43,10) might be a wall (based on the map's ########## border). So the agent can't push the boulder further east. Therefore, the agent needs to move in another direction to get the boulder towards the southeast fountain.

Looking at the fountain locations: it's near southsoutheast, west, and westnorthwest. The westnorthwest fountain is closer to the starting area, but the agent needs to get the boulder to the southsoutheast fountain. To do that, the boulder needs to be moved south and east. But since the agent is blocked on the east, maybe moving south first.

The agent is at (41,10). Moving south to (41,11) might lead to a floor tile. If that's possible, the agent can then move east again once they're south, but need to check if there's a path. Alternatively, moving west to (40,10) to reposition. But the boulder is at (42,10), so moving west would take the agent away from the boulder.

Another approach: check if the boulder can be pushed south or southeast. From (42,10), the agent could move south to (42,11) and push the boulder there. But the agent needs to be adjacent to the boulder to push it. The agent is at (41,10), and the boulder is at (42,10). So the agent is east of the boulder. To push the boulder south, the agent needs to move south into the boulder's tile. So first, move south to (41,11), then move south again into (41,12), but that might not be adjacent. Alternatively, move south to (41,11), then move southwest to (40,11), which might not help.

Alternatively, the agent could move south to (41,11), then move east to (42,11), which is adjacent to the boulder at (42,10). Then push the boulder south to (42,11) -> (42,10) -> (42,11) no, that doesn't make sense. Wait, to push the boulder south, the agent needs to be north of it. The boulder is at (42,10). The agent is at (41,10). So to push the boulder south, the agent needs to move south into the boulder's current position (42,10), which would move the boulder to (42,11). But can the agent do that? The agent is at (41,10), moves south to (41,11), then moves south again into (42,10), pushing the boulder to (42,11). That might be possible.

But the agent's current position is (41,10). Let's see:

1. Move south to (41,11).
2. Then move south to (42,10), pushing the boulder to (42,11).

Assuming that the tiles at (41,11) and (42,10) are floors and (42,11) is a floor and not blocked. The language observations don't explicitly mention those areas, but based on the map, the agent is near the eastern edge with walls to the east, so moving south might be into open space.

Alternatively, the agent could move west to (40,10), then north or south to position themselves to push the boulder in a different direction. But moving west would take them away from the boulder.

Another possibility is to push the boulder north. From (42,10), the agent could move north to (42,9), but the agent is at (41,10). To push north, the agent would need to move north into the boulder's tile (42,10), which would move the boulder to (42,9). But is (42,9) a valid floor tile? The map's upper part isn't shown, but there's a stairs up near west, which is at (38,10) previously. Not sure.

Considering all this, the best immediate action is to move south to (41,11) to reposition and then attempt to push the boulder south into (42,11), moving it closer to the southeast fountain. Alternatively, if moving south isn't possible, check if moving east is still possible, but the earlier observation shows that moving east from (41,10) leads to a wall (#), so that's blocked.

Therefore, the chosen action should be to move south to (41,11) to create space to push the boulder southward towards the fountain.

",-0.001,False
9,west,"<reasoning>
Let's see. I need to figure out where the boulders and fountains are so I can push the boulders onto them. The goal is to solve the Boxoban level here.

Looking at the current position, I'm at (41, 11). The map shows that there's a boulder (`{`) at (41,10) which I just moved to (40,10) earlier. Now I'm one step south at (41,11). The map shows a `@` which is my position, and there's a `#` which might be a wall or obstacle. 

The observations mention a fountain very near westnorthwest and eastnortheast. Wait, but the current map shows the boulder is now adjacent to a `@` (me) at (41,10), but in the latest map, at (41,10) there's a `#` with `@` inside? Maybe the `@` is in the same cell as the `#`, which would mean I'm next to the boulder. 

The message says ""With great effort you move the boulder."" So the last action was pushing the boulder east to (40,10). Now, I need to check if there's a fountain near here. The language observation says fountain adjacent northwest. My current position is (41,11). Northwest would be (40,10), which is where the boulder is now. Wait, but there's a fountain very near westnorthwest. Maybe the fountain is at (39,9) or something? Not sure about the exact coordinates. 

Alternatively, the boulder was moved to (40,10), and if there's a fountain there, then that's the target. But the latest observations mention fountains near westnorthwest and southeast. If I can push the boulder further east, maybe to a fountain. 

Looking at the map, at (41,10) there's a `#` with `@` inside. So I'm standing next to the boulder. To push it further east, I need to move east again, which would move the boulder to (42,10). But I need to check if that's possible. Are there any obstacles behind the boulder? The map shows `#` walls, so if the path east from (40,10) is clear, then I can push the boulder further. 

The bars and dark areas might indicate visibility, but the key is the actual map layout. The `#` symbols are walls, so I can't go through them. The `.` are floor tiles. The `@` is me, and `{` was the boulder, now moved. 

So current position: (41,11). The boulder is at (40,10). To reach it, I need to move south to (41,10), but the map shows `#` there. Wait, maybe the `#` is a wall, so I can't step on it. Then perhaps I need to move west to (40,11) and then south to (40,10), but I need to check the map. 

Alternatively, since the last move was pushing the boulder east, and now it's at (40,10), maybe I should move south to (41,10) to get next to it again? But the map shows `#` at (41,10) with `@` inside. That might mean there's a wall there, so I can't move into that cell. 

Looking at the map again, the line for y=10 has `#<.{..{@`.p#`... Wait, perhaps the exact positions are tricky. Maybe the boulder is at (40,10), and I'm at (41,11). To get to the boulder, I need to move south to (41,10), but that cell is a wall. So maybe I need to go west to (40,11), then south to (40,10). But how? Let me parse the map line by line.

The map's 10th line (assuming y=10 is the 10th line from the top) is: ##.###...# which would correspond to x=35 to x=44. The `@` is at x=41, y=11. The boulder `{` is at x=40, y=10. So to get to the boulder, I need to move south to y=10, but my current y is 11. So moving south would take me to (41,10), but according to the map, that cell is `#`, which is a wall. So I can't move there. 

Therefore, I need to find another path. Maybe move west to (40,11), then south to (40,10) where the boulder is. Let me check if that's possible. From (41,11), moving west to (40,11) is possible if that cell is a floor (.`). Looking at the map line for y=11: the line is ##..`.#@.# which at x=40 is a `.`, so yes, I can move west. Then from (40,11), move south to (40,10), which is the boulder's location. Then push it east again to (41,10), but that cell is a wall. So maybe the next step is to push the boulder north or somewhere else. 

Wait, but the goal is to get the boulder onto a fountain. The observations mention fountains near westnorthwest and southeast. If the boulder is at (40,10), and there's a fountain northwest of that, say at (38,8), then maybe pushing it northwest isn't possible. Alternatively, if the fountain is east of the boulder, then pushing it east again. But the cell at (41,10) is a wall, so that's not possible. 

Alternatively, maybe I need to move the boulder north. From (40,10), moving north would take it to (40,9). If that cell is a floor, then I can push it there. Then check if there's a fountain nearby. 

Looking at the map for y=9: #######..# which is walls, so probably can't go north from (40,10). So north is blocked. What about west? From (40,10), moving west to (39,10). The map line for y=10 is ##.###...# which at x=39 is a `.`, so that's a floor. So I can push the boulder west to (39,10), and check if there's a fountain there. The observations mention fountains near westnorthwest and southeast. If (39,10) is westnorthwest of the boulder's current position, maybe that's a fountain. 

Alternatively, after pushing the boulder west to (39,10), then check if there's a fountain there. If so, then that's the target. Otherwise, need to move it elsewhere. 

So the plan is: 

1. From current position (41,11), move west to (40,11) (possible because `.`).
2. Move south to (40,10) (boulder is here).
3. Push the boulder west to (39,10).
4. Check if (39,10) is a fountain. If yes, goal achieved. If not, move further.

But how does the game represent fountains? The map might show them as `f` or similar, but in the given map, I don't see any `f` except in the language observation. The map uses `#` for walls, `.` for floors, `@` for the player, `{` for boulders, and `*` maybe for fountains? Wait, in the initial problem statement, fountains are on the map, but in the provided map, I don't see any `f` characters. That's confusing. 

Looking back at the user's previous messages, the language observation mentions fountains far eastsoutheast, near east, etc., but the map doesn't show them. Maybe in the actual game, fountains are represented by a different character, like `*` or `f`, but in the provided map, they are not visible. This makes it harder to track. 

Alternatively, the fountains are in the cells described in the language observations but not marked on the map. So perhaps the boulder needs to be moved to a position indicated by the language observations as having a fountain. 

The latest language observation says: fountain very near westnorthwest. My current position is (41,11). Westnorthwest would be around (40,10), which is where the boulder is now. So if the boulder is at (40,10), and there's a fountain very near westnorthwest (which is (40,10)), then that's the target. 

Wait, but the message when pushing the boulder said ""With great effort you move the boulder."" So the last action was successful. Now the boulder is at (40,10), and if that's a fountain, then the level is solved. But how do I know if (40,10) is a fountain? The language observation says fountain very near westnorthwest, which would be (40,10) if that's the case. 

Alternatively, maybe the fountain is at a different coordinate. The problem is that the map doesn't show fountains, only the player, boulders, walls, etc. So I have to rely on the language observations. 

The current language observation says: fountain very near westnorthwest. If the agent is at (41,11), westnorthwest would be (40,10), which is where the boulder is now. So if that's a fountain, then pushing the boulder there would solve the level. 

In that case, the next step is to ensure the boulder is on that fountain. Since the last move pushed it to (40,10), and that's the fountain, then the level is done. But the user hasn't indicated that the level is complete, so maybe there's another boulder or another fountain. 

Looking at the initial problem, the user mentioned it's Boxoban, so there might be multiple boxes and fountains. But in the current observations, there's only one boulder mentioned. The message when moving the boulder says ""With great effort you move the boulder,"" implying that this is the only one. 

So if the boulder is now at (40,10) which is a fountain, then the task is complete. But the agent needs to confirm that. However, the game might not automatically check for victory, so the agent has to ensure the boulder is on a fountain. 

Given that the latest language observation mentions ""fountain very near westnorthwest"" and the boulder is there, it's likely that this is the target. Therefore, the agent has succeeded. But the problem is that the user hasn't provided a 'victory' message yet, so maybe there's more to do. 

Alternatively, perhaps the agent needs to move the boulder further. For example, if there's another fountain east of the current position. But according to the language observations, fountains are near east and southeast. 

Given the current state, the best action is to check if the boulder is on the fountain. If yes, then the level is solved. If not, push it towards the fountain. 

Assuming the boulder is now on the fountain at (40,10), the agent can stop moving. But since the user is asking for the next action, and the agent needs to output an action, perhaps the correct move is to stop moving, but the allowed actions are only the directions. However, in Boxoban-like games, sometimes the agent needs to stand still, but the available actions are only movement. 

Alternatively, the agent should move in a direction that doesn't repeat previous actions. The last few actions were east, east, east, west, east, east, south. Now, perhaps moving north or another direction to check for more fountains or obstacles. 

But given the current observations, the most logical step is to confirm the boulder's position. Since the last move placed it at (40,10) which is a fountain, the agent can stop. However, the game might require the agent to stay in place, but since the available actions are directions, the agent has to choose one. 

Alternatively, the agent might need to move the boulder further. For example, if there's a path east from (40,10) that leads to another fountain. But the map shows a `#` at (41,10), so that's a wall. 

Therefore, the best next action is to check the surroundings. Maybe move north to see if there's a path or another fountain. 

Looking at the current position (41,11), moving north would take me to (41,10), which is a wall (`#`), so that's not possible. Moving west to (40,11) is possible. Then from there, move south to (40,10) to interact with the boulder. 

Alternatively, since the boulder is already in a position indicated by the language observation as having a fountain, perhaps the level is solved, and the agent can stop. But the game might not automatically end, requiring the agent to take no further actions. However, since the available actions are movement, the agent has to choose a direction. 

Given the tip that says ""there is no point in outputting the same action over and over if nothing changes,"" the agent shouldn't keep moving east if it's hitting walls. 

In this case, the most logical next step is to move west to (40,11), then south to (40,10) to ensure the boulder is on the fountain. But since the agent is already at (41,11), moving west to (40,11) is a good idea. 

So the chosen action is west.

10,east,"<reasoning>
I need to figure out the next move here. Let's start by looking at the current situation. The agent is on the map at position (41, 11). The previous actions were moving east multiple times, then south, then west, and there's a message saying they can't pass through the bars. The inventory shows a bunch of items, but nothing that seems relevant right now for pushing boulders or navigating through bars.

The most pressing thing seems to be the boulder that was last moved to the east. In the latest observation after moving east, there's a message about moving the boulder, which means the agent was pushing it. Now, the boulder is adjacent to the east, and the agent is at (40, 10) after moving east, then to (41,10), then south to (41,11), then west back to (40,11)? Wait, no—the map shows the agent's position as (41,11) after moving south from (41,10). But the cursor says (41,11), and the map's fourth line from the bottom has the agent with `#@`... Wait, maybe the map's coordinates are a bit different. Let me try to parse the map.

Looking at the map in the last observation, the agent is represented by `@` at position (41,11). The line with the agent is the fourth line from the bottom (since the map has 10 lines, indices 0-9). Wait, the map structure might be a bit confusing. Each line in the map corresponds to a row. The agent's position (x=41, y=10) might mean that in the map's 10th line (since y starts at 0?), but the way the map is displayed here, it's 10 lines, each with a certain number of characters. The exact coordinates might be tricky, but the key is the direction the agent is facing and the positions of the boulders and fountains.

The boulder was moved east earlier, and now it's adjacent to the east. The agent is at (41,11). Looking at the language observations, there's a boulder very near southeast and westsouthwest. Also, the bars are blocking movement in some directions. The message says ""You cannot pass through the bars,"" which means the agent tried to move into a barred area. The latest action was west, but the result was hitting bars. So the agent is now at (41,11) facing west, but the bars are there, so moving west again isn't possible.

The goal in Boxoban is to push all boulders onto fountains. Currently, there's a boulder at (40,10) after being pushed east. The fountain is at eastsoutheast, which might be near the agent's current position. Wait, in the language observations, there's a fountain very near westnorthwest. The agent is at (41,11), so westnorthwest would be towards (40,10) perhaps. The boulder that was moved east is now adjacent to the east, but the map shows `@` at (41,11) with a `#` to the east (maybe the boulder is there). The fountain is adjacent to northwest, which would be to the northwest direction from the agent's current position.

So the plan is to move the boulder onto the fountain. Since the boulder is to the east, the agent needs to position themselves to push it further east towards the fountain. But the agent is at (41,11), and the boulder is adjacent east. To push it east, the agent needs to walk into it from the west. So first, the agent should move east to be next to the boulder, then push it east towards the fountain.

But wait, the agent just tried moving west and hit bars. So the immediate west is barred. The agent is at (41,11). The boulder is to the east (position 42,11). To push it east, the agent needs to move east into it. So the next action should be east. However, in the previous steps, moving east several times got the agent to (41,10), then moved the boulder, and now after moving south and west, the agent is at (41,11). The boulder is now adjacent east, so moving east would allow the agent to push it further.

But before that, the agent needs to check if the path to the east is clear. The language observation mentions bars very near northeast, eastnortheast, east, etc. So moving east might be possible if there are no bars in the way. The message after moving east previously was that the boulder was moved, so the path east was clear then. Now, the agent is at (41,11), and the boulder is adjacent east. So moving east would allow the agent to step on the boulder and push it east.

Therefore, the next action should be east. The agent needs to move east once to get next to the boulder, then push it east towards the fountain. This makes sense because the goal is to get the boulder onto the fountain. The agent should avoid moving into the bars, which are blocking the west direction. So the best move is to go east again to push the boulder further.

Let's try to figure out what the agent should do next. The agent is in Boxoban, pushing a boulder to a fountain. Looking at the current observation, the map shows the agent's position at (42, 11) with a boulder at (41, 10). The goal is to push the boulder onto a fountain.

First, I need to check the surroundings. The language observation mentions a fountain very near westnorthwest and adjacent northeast, east, and southeast. The bars and dark areas might be obstacles. The agent moved east several times before getting here, but moving further east might hit the bars. 

Looking at the map, the current cell has a '@' which is the agent, and the boulder is to the west at (41, 10). The agent needs to push the boulder. Since the last action was east, which resulted in the message that the boulder was moved, but now the agent is at (42, 11), perhaps the boulder is now at (41, 10). Wait, after moving east, the boulder should be one cell behind. So maybe after moving east, the boulder is at (40, 10). Wait, the map shows the boulder as '@' at (41, 10) now? Wait, in the map, the agent is at (42, 11), and the boulder is in the cell (41, 10). So the agent is one cell east and one cell south of the boulder. 

To push the boulder, the agent needs to move in the direction opposite to where the boulder is. Since the boulder is at (41, 10), which is north and west of the agent's current position (42,11). Wait, no. The agent is at (42,11), and the boulder is at (41,10). So the boulder is one cell west and one cell south of the agent. To push the boulder north or east, the agent needs to move towards it. But the agent is already south of the boulder. Wait, maybe I'm getting the coordinates wrong. In NetHack, the coordinate system is (x,y) where x increases to the east and y increases downward. So moving north would decrease the y-coordinate, and east increases the x-coordinate.

So the agent is at (42,11). The boulder is at (41,10). That means the boulder is one cell to the west (x=41) and one cell to the south (y=10) of the agent. Wait, no: the agent is at (42,11), so moving south would take the agent to y=12, which is further down. The boulder is at (41,10), which is to the west (lower x) and north (lower y) of the agent. So the agent is south and east of the boulder. 

To push the boulder, the agent needs to move in the direction opposite to the boulder's position. For example, if the boulder is north of the agent, the agent can move south to push it north. But in this case, the boulder is north and west of the agent. So the agent is south and east of the boulder. Therefore, to push the boulder north or west, the agent would need to move south or east. Wait, no. To push the boulder north, the agent must stand on it and move south. Similarly, to push west, the agent must stand on it and move east. 

But the agent is at (42,11), and the boulder is at (41,10). So the agent is to the east and south of the boulder. Therefore, the boulder is north and west of the agent. To push the boulder west (towards lower x), the agent needs to move east onto the boulder. But the agent is already east of the boulder. Wait, the boulder is at (41,10), and the agent is at (42,11). So the agent is one cell east and one cell south of the boulder. To push the boulder west, the agent would have to be on the boulder and move east. But the agent is already east of the boulder. That doesn't make sense. 

Wait, perhaps the map shows the boulder at (41,10), which is the cell where the agent was before moving east. The agent moved east to (42,10), but the boulder was pushed to (41,10). Wait, no. When the agent moves east into the boulder, the boulder moves east as well. So in the previous step, when the agent moved east from (41,10) to (42,10), the boulder would have moved to (40,10). But in the current observation, the map shows the boulder at (41,10) with the agent at (42,11). That might indicate a different movement. 

Alternatively, perhaps the agent moved south after pushing the boulder. Let me look back at the history. The last few actions were east, east, east, west, east, east, east, south, west, east. Then the current position is (42,11). The message after moving east said ""With great effort you move the boulder."" So the boulder was at (41,10), and moving east would push it to (42,10). But the agent's current position is (42,11). So perhaps after pushing the boulder east to (42,10), the agent moved south to (42,11). 

Now, the boulder is at (42,10). The agent is at (42,11). The goal is to get the boulder onto a fountain. The language observation mentions a fountain very near westnorthwest. So the fountain is to the northwest of the agent's current position. Let's check the map again. The map shows the agent's position with '@' at (42,11), and the boulder is at (41,10). Wait, that's confusing. If the agent pushed the boulder east, the boulder should be at (42,10), but the map shows it at (41,10). Maybe there's a mistake in parsing the map. 

Looking at the map in the current observation:

The agent's position is (42,11), which corresponds to the line with ""#<.{..{.`#"". Wait, the map lines are a bit confusing. Each line represents a row, and the columns are indexed from left to right. The agent's position is (x=42, y=11), which would be the 42nd column in the 11th row. Let's look at the 11th row of the map:

""##..`.#@.#"" 

Breaking this down, each '#' is a wall, '.' is a floor, and '@' is the agent. The line is: ##..`.#@.# 

Assuming each character is a tile. Let's count the positions:

0: #
1: #
2: .
3: .
4: `
5: .
6: #
7: @
8: .
9: #
10: . 

So the agent is at position 7 (0-based index) of the 11th row, which corresponds to x=7+1=8 (since x starts at 1?), or maybe the coordinates are off. This part is a bit unclear. Alternatively, perhaps the map is represented with x increasing to the right and y increasing downward, matching the coordinate system. The agent's position (x=42, y=11) would be somewhere in the right part of the map. 

Given the confusion in parsing the map correctly, perhaps it's better to focus on the language observations. The important thing is that there's a fountain very near westnorthwest, and the boulder is currently adjacent to some bars and dark areas. The agent needs to get the boulder towards the fountain. 

The agent is currently at (42,11), and the boulder is at (41,10). To push the boulder towards the fountain in the westnorthwest direction, the agent needs to move in a direction that allows pushing the boulder west or north. Since the boulder is at (41,10), which is west and north of the agent's current position (42,11), the agent can push the boulder west by moving east onto it. Wait, no. The agent is at (42,11), and the boulder is at (41,10). So the boulder is one cell west and one cell north of the agent. To push the boulder west, the agent would need to be on the boulder and move east. But the agent is already east of the boulder. This seems conflicting. 

Alternatively, perhaps the agent needs to move north to get into position to push the boulder west. The agent is at (42,11). If the agent moves north to (42,10), then they can be on the boulder at (41,10) and push it west to (40,10). But the current map shows the boulder at (41,10), and the agent at (42,11). So moving north to (42,10) would allow the agent to be adjacent to the boulder. From there, moving west would push the boulder to (40,10). 

But the agent's last action was south, which took them from (42,10) to (42,11). So the boulder is now at (41,10), and the agent is at (42,11). To get to (42,10), the agent needs to move south again. Once there, they can move west to push the boulder. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent can move west from (42,11) to (41,11), but there might be bars there. The language observation says there are bars adjacent northeast, east, and southeast. The agent's current position has bars adjacent to northeast, east, and southeast. So moving west might be possible if there's no obstacle. 

Wait, the language observation says ""bars adjacent northeast, east, and southeast"". So the agent's current position (42,11) has bars to the northeast, east, and southeast. That means the cells to the northeast (43,12), east (43,11), and southeast (43,12) are barriers. Moving west would take the agent to (41,11), which might be a floor or a different tile. 

Looking at the map line for y=11: ""##..`.#@.#"" (assuming each character is a tile). The agent is at position 7 (0-based), which is '@'. The tiles to the west (positions 0-6) are mostly '#' except for some '.' and '`'. So moving west from (42,11) to (41,11) would likely hit a wall ('#') because the first few characters are '#'. Therefore, moving west is blocked by bars. 

The agent's options are to move north, south, east, or west. But west is blocked. North would take them to (42,10), which is the cell with the boulder at (41,10). From there, they can move west to push the boulder. Alternatively, moving south back to (42,10) where the boulder is. 

So the optimal path seems to be: move south to (42,10), then move west to push the boulder to (40,10). That would get the boulder closer to the fountain in the westnorthwest direction. 

Alternatively, the agent could move north to (42,10) and then west. But moving south is straightforward to get back to the boulder's current position. 

Another consideration: the stairs up are near westnorthwest, so maybe the goal is to get the boulder to a fountain in that area. The current boulder is at (41,10), and the fountain is westnorthwest, which would be further west and north. So pushing the boulder west and north would be necessary. 

In summary, the next steps should be:
1. Move south from (42,11) to (42,10) to get next to the boulder.
2. Move west from (42,10) to (41,10) to push the boulder to (40,10).
3. Continue moving the boulder west and north towards the fountain.

But since the agent is already south of the boulder, moving south again would take them away. Wait, no: the agent is at (42,11), and the boulder is at (41,10). Moving south would take the agent to (42,12), which is further down. That's not helpful. Instead, the agent should move north to (42,10) to be adjacent to the boulder. Then move west to push it. 

So the correct action would be to move north. However, looking at the map, the cell to the north (y=10) at x=42 is part of the line ""##.###`.#"" which includes a '`' and '#', so it might not be a floor. Wait, the 10th row of the map is ""##..###`.#"". So at x=42 (assuming each character is a position), the 10th row is:

##..###`.#

Breaking it down:
0: #
1: #
2: .
3: .
4: #
5: #
6: #
7: `
8: .
9: #

So the cell at x=42, y=10 (which would be position 7 in the 0-based index) is a backtick ('`'), which is a floor tile. So moving north to (42,10) is possible. 

Once the agent is at (42,10), they can move west to (41,10), pushing the boulder to (40,10). That would move the boulder closer to the fountain in the westnorthwest direction. 

Therefore, the best next action is to move north to get into position to push the boulder west.

Let's see. I need to push the boulder onto the fountain in this Boxoban-like game. The agent has already moved the boulder a few times, but maybe it's not in the right position yet.

Looking at the current observation, the agent is at (42, 10). The boulder is adjacent north. The map shows that moving north would take the agent towards the boulder. The goal is to get the boulder onto the fountain. Checking the language observations, there's a fountain very near west, but I need to check if the boulder is near that.

Earlier messages indicated that moving the boulder east resulted in a message about effort, so maybe the boulder was moved east before. But now, the agent is facing north, and the boulder is north of them. So pushing the boulder north might be the way to go. Alternatively, moving east again could place it closer to the fountain.

Wait, the latest message says ""With great effort you move the boulder"" when the agent moved east. Now, the boulder is adjacent north. If I move north, I can push the boulder further north. But where's the fountain? The language observation mentions a fountain very near west. If the boulder can be pushed west towards that fountain, that would solve the problem.

But the agent is at (42,10), and the fountain is west. Moving west might not be possible due to bars or dark areas. The bars are listed far southsoutheast, etc., but the agent's current position has bars very near north, northeast, etc. So moving west might be blocked by bars. Let me check the map again.

The map shows at (42,10), the agent's position is next to a `@` which is the boulder. To push it north, the agent would move north into the `@`, which represents the boulder. If there's space behind the boulder, then pushing north is possible. Looking at the map, the line at y=9 has `##########`, which is a wall. So pushing the boulder north would take it into y=9, which is a wall. That's not possible. Therefore, the boulder can't be pushed north further.

So maybe the agent needs to move east again to get the boulder closer to the west fountain. Wait, the agent is at (42,10). Moving east would take them to (43,10). The boulder is adjacent north, so at (42,9). If the agent moves east, then the boulder is still north of them. Alternatively, maybe the agent should move the boulder in another direction.

Alternatively, check if there's a clear path west to the fountain. The fountain is very near west, but the agent's current x is 42. Moving west from 42 would take them towards x=41, which has a `#` in the map. So there's a wall there. Therefore, moving west directly isn't possible.

Hmm. So the boulder is north of the agent. To move it towards the west fountain, the agent might need to position themselves such that pushing the boulder east or west would get it closer. But given the current position and barriers, maybe moving south and then east?

Wait, the agent was previously at (42,11) and moved north back to (42,10). The boulder was moved east earlier. Let me retrace the steps. The agent moved east several times, pushing the boulder each time. The latest move was east to (42,10), and the boulder is now at (42,9). The fountain is very near west at (x=41, y=10?), but the agent's current position is (42,10). If the boulder is at (42,9), pushing it west would move it to (41,9), which might be towards the fountain.

But the map shows at (41,9) there's a `#` (wall), so that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe pushing the boulder south into a different position. The agent's current position is (42,10). If they move south to (42,11), then maybe they can push the boulder east or west from there. But looking at the map at y=11, the agent's position has a `#` at (42,11), so moving south isn't possible unless there's a path.

Wait, the map at y=11 for x=42 shows a `@` which is the boulder, but earlier when the agent was at (41,11), they moved south to (41,12), but now the map shows the agent at (42,10). The map might have changed based on movements. This is a bit confusing, but based on the current observation, the agent is at (42,10) with the boulder at (42,9). The goal is to get the boulder onto the fountain west of here.

Since moving west is blocked by a wall, perhaps the agent needs to move the boulder east first. If the agent moves east to (43,10), then pushes the boulder north or south. But the boulder is currently at (42,9). If the agent is at (43,10), they can't push the boulder north because y=9 is a wall. Alternatively, moving the boulder east to (43,9), but is there space there?

Looking at the map, at (43,9) it's a `#`, so that's a wall. Hmm. Maybe the agent needs to find a way to maneuver the boulder around the obstacles. Alternatively, check if there's a fountain in another direction. The language observation mentions a fountain very near west, but also a fountain near east. Wait, in the current language observation, it says ""fountain very near west"" and ""fountain adjacent northwest"". So the closest fountain is west, but the path is blocked by walls.

Alternatively, maybe the boulder needs to be pushed into a position where it's adjacent to the fountain. Since the agent can't move west, perhaps moving the boulder north or south around the barriers. But the north direction is a wall. South might be possible. If the agent moves south to (42,11), then pushes the boulder east or west. But at (42,11), the map shows a `#`, so movement there is blocked.

This is tricky. The agent has to navigate the boulder around the obstacles to reach the fountain. Given the current position and the barriers, the best action might be to push the boulder east, even if it's not towards the fountain directly, to create space or find a path. Alternatively, move the agent east and then push the boulder north or west.

Wait, the boulder is adjacent north at (42,9). If the agent moves east to (43,10), then they can push the boulder north to (43,9), but that's a wall. Alternatively, push the boulder south to (42,10) but the agent is already there. Maybe the agent should move south to (42,11) and then push the boulder west. But (42,11) is blocked by a `#`, so that's not possible.

Another approach: check the inventory. The agent has a blessed potion of extra healing, scrolls, etc., but no tools that would help push the boulder further. The only way is to move the agent in such a way to push the boulder around the corners.

Given the current map and position, the agent is at (42,10) with the boulder north. The only possible directions to push the boulder are north (into a wall), south (blocked), east (if there's space), or west (blocked). Since pushing north is impossible, maybe the agent needs to move east and then try a different direction.

So, moving east to (43,10) and then trying to push the boulder west or north. But pushing west from (43,10) would take the boulder to (42,10), which is where the agent is. That's not helpful. Alternatively, pushing north from (43,10) to (43,9), but that's a wall.

Hmm. Maybe the agent needs to move south to (42,11) even though it's blocked. Wait, the map shows at (42,11) there's a `#`, so the agent can't move into that. Therefore, the agent is stuck. Maybe the only option is to push the boulder east again, even if it's not leading directly to the fountain, to see if there's a different path.

Alternatively, check if there's a fountain in another direction. The language observation mentions a fountain adjacent northwest. The agent's current position is (42,10). Northwest would be (41,9), which has a `#` in the map. So that's a wall. Not helpful.

I think the best possible action here is to push the boulder north, but since that's blocked, maybe the agent needs to move east and then try again. Wait, but the boulder is already north of the agent. So moving the agent east to (43,10) allows them to push the boulder north into (43,9), but that's a wall. Alternatively, push the boulder east from (42,9) to (43,9), which is a wall. So that's not possible.

This seems like a dead end. Maybe the agent needs to reposition themselves by moving west, but that's blocked by bars. Alternatively, move south and then east. But moving south is blocked.

Wait, the agent was at (42,11) previously. If they move north back to (42,10), then push the boulder east again, maybe into a different position. But earlier attempts to move east had already placed the boulder further east, but perhaps not towards the fountain.

Alternatively, check if the boulder can be pushed into the northwest fountain. But the path is blocked by walls.

Given all this, the only feasible action is to push the boulder north, but it's blocked. Therefore, the agent must move in a direction that allows pushing the boulder towards the fountain. Since movement east isn't working, perhaps the agent needs to find another way.

Wait, the latest message says that moving the boulder resulted in effort, so perhaps the boulder was moved east recently. The current position has the boulder north of the agent. Maybe the agent should move west to (41,10) and then push the boulder north or south. But moving west is blocked by bars.

Hmm. This is challenging. The agent is stuck between walls and needs to maneuver the boulder around. Given the current observations, the best action might be to move east again to see if there's a new path, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, move north and try to push the boulder into a different spot.

Wait, the agent's current position is (42,10). The boulder is at (42,9). If the agent moves north to (42,9), they can then push the boulder further north, but y=8 is a wall (########## at the top). So that's not possible.

Alternatively, the agent could move south to (42,11), but that's blocked. So the only possible movement is east or west, but both are blocked or result in pushing into walls.

In this case, maybe the agent needs to try a different approach. Perhaps the boulder needs to be moved to a different part of the map where the fountain is accessible. But given the current layout, it's unclear how to do that.

Given all this, the safest action that might progress the game is to push the boulder east again, even if it's not leading directly to the fountain, to see if there's a change in the environment or path.

13,west,"<reasoning>
Let's see. The agent is trying to solve Boxoban here. The goal is to push the boulders onto the fountains. Observing the current state:

From the map, the agent's position is (42, 10). The boulder is at (42,11) based on the last move where pushing north moved it there. The fountain is nearby in the westnorthwest direction. The bars are blocking movement to the west, so that's not an option. 

The agent just tried moving east but hit bars. So east is blocked. The previous move was north, which successfully pushed the boulder from (42,11) to (42,10). Now, the boulder is adjacent to the agent again. 

The next step should be to continue pushing the boulder towards the fountain. Since the boulder is to the north (now at (42,10)), the agent can try moving north again. But wait, in the last move, moving north pushed the boulder north. Now, after that, the boulder is at (42,10) north of the agent. Wait, maybe I should recheck the positions.

Wait, the agent is at (42,10). The boulder was at (42,11), and moving north pushed it to (42,10). So now the boulder is at the same y-level as the agent but in the north direction? That doesn't make sense. Maybe the coordinate system is such that moving north increases the y-coordinate. Wait, in the map, the agent's initial position was (35,10). When moving east, x increases. So perhaps north increases y. So moving north from (42,10) would go to (42,11), but the boulder was there, so pushing north would move it to (42,12). Wait, maybe I'm confused.

Looking at the map after the last move:

The map shows the agent's position as (42,10) with a '@' and the boulder in the north direction, which would be (42,9) or (42,11)? The map line for y=11 shows `##..`.#.@#` which might indicate the boulder at that position. Wait, the map's exact layout is a bit unclear. But based on the message that ""With great effort you move the boulder"" after moving north, the boulder was pushed north. So from (42,11) to (42,10), which is the agent's current position. Wait, that can't be right. Maybe the agent is at (42,10), and the boulder was at (42,11), pushing north would move the boulder to (42,12). But the message says the boulder was moved, so perhaps the agent moved north into the boulder, pushing it further north. 

In any case, the current situation is that the boulder is adjacent to the agent. The agent needs to push it towards the fountain. The fountain is in the westnorthwest direction, which is to the northwest of the agent. But the bars are blocking the way west. So maybe the agent needs to move around the boulder to the east or another direction. 

Alternatively, since the boulder is now at (42,10) north of the agent (if moving north pushed it there), then the agent could try pushing it further north. But looking at the language observations, there are bars very near north, so north might be blocked by bars. The message when trying to move east said ""You cannot pass through the bars,"" so east is blocked. 

Wait, the current language observation shows that bars are adjacent to northeast, east, and southeast. So the agent is surrounded by bars on those sides. The only open directions might be north, west, or south. But moving north might hit bars. Let's check the bars' positions. The bars very near include north, northnortheast, northeast, etc. So moving north from the agent's position (42,10) would go into a bar area. 

Alternatively, the agent could move west towards the stairs up, but the bars are adjacent to west. The message says ""bars adjacent southwest and northwest,"" but the cursor is at (42,10), so the adjacent directions would be north, south, east, west. The bars are adjacent to northeast, east, and southeast, according to the current observation. So west might be possible if there are no bars there. Wait, the current observation says ""bars adjacent northeast, east, and southeast."" So west is not adjacent to bars. Therefore, the agent could move west towards the stairs up. 

Moving west would take the agent to (41,10). The stairs up are very near west, so that's probably the way to go. But the goal is to push the boulder onto the fountain. The fountain is in the westnorthwest direction, so maybe moving west and then north or northwest? But given the bars, perhaps the correct path is to first move the boulder to a position where it can reach the fountain. 

Alternatively, since the boulder was pushed north to (42,10) (assuming that's possible), maybe the agent can now move west and push the boulder west-northwest. But the bars are in the way. Maybe the agent needs to move the boulder in a different direction. 

Wait, the current boulder is at (42,10), adjacent to the agent. If the agent moves west, then the boulder is to the north. Wait, maybe the coordinates are such that moving north increases y. So the agent is at (42,10), and the boulder is at (42,9) if pushed north. Or maybe (42,11) if pushed south. This is getting confusing. 

Alternatively, perhaps the best move is to move west towards the stairs up, then find another way. But the goal is to push the boulder onto the fountain. The fountain is near westnorthwest, so perhaps moving the boulder west and then north. But the bars are blocking. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent can push the boulder east, but that's blocked by bars. So the only feasible move is north or west. But north is blocked by bars. So west might be the only option. Moving west to (41,10), then perhaps from there, move the boulder in another direction. 

But the agent needs to push the boulder. Since the boulder is adjacent, the agent can try pushing it west if possible. Let's check the map. The map at (42,10) shows `#<.{..{.@#` — perhaps the '@' is the agent, and the '.' and symbols around are the boulder. If moving west, the boulder would be at (41,10), but need to check if that's a valid position. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent should first move north to get the boulder out of the way. But north is blocked. So perhaps the only option is to move west, then see if the boulder can be pushed from there. 

Given the current constraints, the best action is to move west towards the stairs, perhaps to find a path to the fountain. Alternatively, try pushing the boulder west if possible. But since the agent is at (42,10) and the boulder is adjacent north, pushing west would require the boulder to be in the direction the agent is moving. Wait, if the agent moves west, the boulder would have to be to the west of the agent. But according to the map, the boulder is to the north. So maybe the agent needs to reposition. 

This is getting a bit tangled. Perhaps the safest move is to move west to (41,10) and then look for a way to push the boulder north or northwest. Alternatively, check if there's a way to move the boulder south. 

Wait, the boulder was pushed north to (42,10), which might be the same y-level as the agent. If the agent moves north, they would be in the same cell as the boulder, which isn't allowed. So the agent needs to move in a direction that allows pushing the boulder. 

Given the bars blocking east, north seems blocked, and the boulder is north of the agent, the only open directions are west and south. Moving west to (41,10) might be possible. Then, from there, perhaps push the boulder north or west. 

Alternatively, the agent could move south to (42,9) and then try pushing the boulder north again. But I need to check the map for obstacles. 

Given the current information, the best action is to move west towards the stairs up, which are nearby, and perhaps find a path to the fountain from there.

The agent is trying to solve a Boxoban-like puzzle where the goal is to push boulders onto fountains. The current observation shows the agent's position at (41, 10), and there's a boulder adjacent to the east (east of (41,10)). The map has several bars and dark areas, but the key elements here are the boulder and the fountain.

Looking at the previous actions, the agent has been moving east, then west, south, etc., trying to position the boulder. The last message was about moving the boulder, so now the boulder is probably one space east. The agent is back at (41,10) after trying to go east but hitting bars. 

The next step is to push the boulder towards the fountain. Since the boulder is adjacent east, the agent needs to move east again to push it. But wait, the last attempt to move east resulted in ""You cannot pass through the bars,"" which suggests there's a bar blocking the path. Wait, no, the bars are far southsoutheast, southsouthwest, etc. The immediate east of (41,10) is where the boulder is. So to push the boulder east, the agent needs to move into the boulder's space, which requires the space beyond the boulder to be clear. 

Looking at the language observation: ""boulder adjacent east"" at (41,10). So the boulder is at (42,10). To push it east to (43,10), the agent needs to move east into (42,10), which is the boulder, and then the boulder moves east. But the problem is whether (43,10) is clear. The bars are far away, and the map shows that at (42,10) is the agent, and the boulder is there. The next cell east (43,10) might be a wall or clear. From the map, it's hard to tell, but the agent's previous movements suggest that moving east past the boulder might be possible now that it's been pushed once before. 

The agent's inventory includes tools, but nothing that would help here. The priority is to get the boulder onto the fountain. The fountain is near eastsoutheast, which might be where the boulder needs to go. The agent needs to maneuver the boulder towards that area. 

Since the boulder is adjacent east, the correct action is to move east to push it. Even though the last attempt to move east resulted in a bar, perhaps that was a different location. Wait, in the last step, the agent tried to move east from (41,10) to (42,10), which is the boulder, but there was a bar blocking. But now the boulder has been moved once before, so maybe the path is clear now. 

Looking at the current language observation: ""bars very near north, northnortheast, northeast, eastnortheast, east, eastsoutheast, southeast, southsoutheast, southwest, westnorthwest, northwest, and northnorthwest."" The immediate east of (41,10) is the boulder. The space beyond that (43,10) is not mentioned as blocked, so assuming it's clear, the agent can push the boulder east by moving east into it. 

Therefore, the correct action is to move east again to push the boulder one step further towards the fountain.

The agent is trying to solve Boxoban, pushing boulders to fountains. Let me look at the current state.

The player is at (42, 10). The map shows some bars and dark areas, but the key elements are the boulders and fountains. The player previously moved a boulder to the east, but now they hit a bar again. The boulders are adjacent to the player, and there's a fountain nearby. The goal is to push all boulders onto fountains.

Looking at the language observations, the fountain is very near west, and there's a boulder adjacent east. The player just tried moving east but hit bars. So maybe the boulder is in the way. The last action was east, which resulted in a ""You cannot pass through the bars"" message. Wait, no—earlier moves resulted in moving the boulder. Now, after some back-and-forth, the agent is back at (42, 10) with a boulder adjacent east.

The player needs to push the boulder to the fountain. Since the boulder is adjacent east, but there's a bar blocking the way. Wait, the bars are far southsoutheast, etc., but the immediate area might have obstacles. The map shows a '#' which could be a wall or barrier. The player tried moving east but hit bars, meaning there's an obstacle there. The boulder is adjacent east, so perhaps the path is blocked by a bar, not another boulder. So to push the boulder east, the player needs to move it around the bars. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the boulder is stuck next to a bar, and the player needs to position themselves to push it in a different direction. Let me check the map again. The map shows at (41,10) there's a `@` (player) and at (42,10) a `{` which might be a boulder. The `#` symbols are walls or bars. So the boulder is at (42,10), and the player is at (41,10). To push the boulder east to (43,10), but there's a `#` at (43,10), which is a bar. So the agent can't push the boulder east because it's blocked by a bar. Therefore, the agent needs to find another way around.

Alternatively, maybe the agent can move north or south to position themselves to push the boulder in a different direction. Looking at the cursor position (42,10), moving north would take them to (42,9), but the map shows ########## around, so perhaps that's a wall. Moving south to (42,11) is possible if there's no obstacle. The previous move south was allowed, and the map shows a `@` there. But after moving south, there's a bar, so maybe pushing the boulder south isn't possible.

Wait, the agent's current position is (42,10), and the boulder is adjacent east at (42,10) perhaps? Or maybe the boulder is at (43,10) but blocked by a bar. The map might have a typo, but based on the observations, the boulder is adjacent east. So the agent needs to move east but can't because of bars. Therefore, the only option is to move around the boulder. Since the agent is at (42,10), maybe moving north or south to get a different angle. But north might be a wall. Looking at the map, the ninth line (y=9) has #######..#, which at x=42 would be the last character, so maybe a wall. So moving north is blocked. Moving south to (42,11) is possible if there's no obstacle. The map shows at (42,11) a `@` after moving south earlier, but now it's blocked by bars. So perhaps the only way is to move west to get a different position. But the agent just tried moving west and is back at (41,10).

Alternatively, maybe the agent can push the boulder north or south. If the boulder is at (42,10), pushing north to (42,9) might be possible if there's no obstacle. But the map shows ########## at y=9, which is likely walls. So that's not an option. Pushing south to (42,11) might be possible if the path is clear. The agent was there before, but now there's a bar. So perhaps the boulder can't be moved that way.

Hmm, maybe the agent needs to find another boulder. Looking at the observations, there's a boulder adjacent east and a boulder very near southsoutheast. The main goal is to push all boulders to fountains. The fountain is very near west, so perhaps the agent needs to push the boulder west towards the fountain. But the current position has the boulder blocked by bars east. So the agent might need to move west to get alongside the boulder and push it west. But the agent is already west of the boulder at (41,10). Wait, no—the boulder is at (42,10), and the agent is at (41,10). So to push the boulder west to (40,10), which is clear if there's no obstacle. Let me check the map. The map at (40,10) is part of the ##########, so it's a wall. Therefore, pushing west is blocked. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, maybe the agent can move north around the bars. But the north direction from (42,10) is likely a wall. So the only option might be to move east again, but the bars are there. Wait, the agent previously moved the boulder east, but now it's stuck. Maybe the agent needs to backtrack and find another boulder. Or perhaps the agent should interact with the stairs up adjacent west. But the stairs are probably for going up a level, which isn't necessary here since it's level 1.

Wait, the agent's inventory has a blessed potion of extra healing and other items, but those aren't relevant for pushing boulders. The key is to manipulate the boulders. The agent needs to push the boulder onto the fountain. The fountain is very near west, so maybe the boulder needs to be moved west. But the path is blocked by bars. Unless there's a different path around the bars.

Looking at the language observations again: bars very near north, northnortheast, etc., but the immediate area around the agent has bars to the east. The only clear path might be south. The agent was able to move south earlier. If the agent moves south to (42,11), perhaps there's a way to push the boulder from there. But the map shows a `#` at (42,11) as part of the ########## structure. So that's blocked.

This is tricky. Maybe the agent needs to find another boulder. The observations mention a boulder very near southsoutheast. The agent might need to go that way. But how to get there? The agent is at (42,10), and the southsoutheast direction would be moving down and right. But the bars and dark areas might block that path.

Alternatively, the agent could try to move the boulder in a different direction. Since the boulder is at (42,10) adjacent east, and the agent is at (41,10), pushing the boulder east is blocked by bars. Maybe pushing it north or south. But north is a wall, south is blocked. Therefore, the only option is to move west and look for another way to push the boulder. But the agent is already west of the boulder.

Wait, perhaps the agent can push the boulder east twice. First, push it east to (43,10), but that's blocked by a bar. So that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe the agent can move around the bar. For example, move north to (41,9), but that's a wall. Move south to (41,11), which might be possible. Then, from there, try to push the boulder east. But this requires navigating around the obstacles.

Alternatively, the agent could use the stairs up adjacent west to go to another level, but that's probably not necessary here. The problem is level 1, and the goal is to push the boulder on this level.

Given all this, the most reasonable action is to continue trying to push the boulder in a feasible direction. Since east is blocked, maybe moving north or south to find a different path. However, based on the current map and observations, the only viable move might be to move west again, but that doesn't help. Alternatively, the agent could try to push the boulder south, but the path is blocked.

Wait, the agent's previous move south resulted in being at (42,11), which had a `@` but now is blocked by bars. So moving south again isn't possible. The agent might need to find another approach. Maybe the boulder can be pushed north around the bars. But the north direction is a wall.

Hmm. Another possibility: the agent might have to move east again, but the bars are there. Unless the bars are not solid obstacles but just visual elements. Wait, in NetHack/MiniHack, bars (`#`) are typically solid walls. So the agent can't move through them. Therefore, the only option is to find a way to push the boulder around the bars.

Wait, the boulder is at (42,10), and the agent is at (41,10). To push the boulder west to (40,10), but that's a wall. To push it north to (42,9), which is a wall. To push it south to (42,11), which is blocked. To push it east to (43,10), blocked by a bar. So the boulder is trapped.

This suggests that there's another boulder or the agent needs to interact with something else. The observations mention a boulder very near southsoutheast. The agent might need to go there. To do that, the agent would need to move southwest or southeast. But the current position is (42,10), and moving southwest would be to (41,9), which is likely a wall. Moving southeast to (43,11) might be possible if the path is clear.

Looking at the map, the ninth line (y=9) is #######..#, so at x=42, y=9 is the last `#`, which is a wall. Moving southeast from (42,10) to (43,11) would require checking the map. But the map at y=11, x=43 is not shown, but the agent's current position at (42,11) has a `#` at the end. So moving southeast might be into a dark area or bar.

This is getting complicated. Perhaps the best action is to move south again to see if there's a different path, but earlier attempts showed that's blocked. Alternatively, the agent could try to move west and then north to get a different angle. From (41,10), move north to (41,9), but that's a wall. Move south to (41,11), which might be possible. Then from there, try to push the boulder east.

Alternatively, the agent could use the potion of extra healing, but that's not relevant here. The main task is moving the boulder. Since all direct pushes are blocked, the agent needs to find an alternative path. Maybe the solution is to move the boulder in a different direction that the agent hasn't tried yet.

Wait, the agent previously moved the boulder east, but now it's stuck. Maybe the agent needs to move west past the boulder and then push it in another direction. But the boulder is at (42,10), and the agent is at (41,10). To push the boulder west, the agent needs to be adjacent to it on the west side. The agent is already west of the boulder, so pushing west would require the agent to be next to the boulder's west side. But the boulder is at (42,10), so the agent is at (41,10), adjacent to the boulder's west side. So pushing the boulder west would be to (40,10), which is a wall. Therefore, that's not possible.

Hmm. Maybe the agent needs to move north around the bars. From (42,10), move north to (42,9), but that's a wall. Move west to (41,10), which is where the agent was. This seems like a loop.

Alternatively, the agent could try to pick up an item, but the inventory doesn't have anything useful for moving boulders. The credit card, camera, etc., aren't relevant.

Given all this, the only feasible action might be to move east again, even though it results in a ""You cannot pass through the bars"" message, but perhaps there's a different interpretation. Wait, earlier when the agent moved the boulder east, they succeeded. Now, after moving around, the boulder might have been moved, but perhaps the agent is not adjacent to it anymore. Wait, the current cursor is at (42,10), and the boulder is adjacent east. So the agent is next to the boulder, facing east. But the bars are blocking the path. So pushing the boulder east is impossible.

In Boxoban, sometimes the only way is to move the boulder in a different direction if all others are blocked. Since all directions are blocked except maybe south, but that's also blocked. This suggests that the agent might need to explore other areas of the map to find another boulder or a different pathway.

Alternatively, the agent could check if there's a fountain nearby that the boulder can be pushed onto. The observations mention a fountain very near west. So the boulder needs to be moved west. But the path is blocked by bars. Unless there's a way around the bars to the west.

Looking at the language observations, the bars are very near north, northnortheast, etc., but the west direction near the agent is clear. The stairs up are adjacent west, so maybe moving west to the stairs and then finding a way down, but that's level 1.

Wait, the agent's x=42, y=10. Moving west to x=41, y=10, which is the player's previous position. From there, maybe moving north or south. But earlier attempts didn't help.

At this point, perhaps the best action is to explore other directions, like moving south to see if there's a different path or another boulder. Even though the previous move south was blocked, maybe there's a change now. Alternatively, move west to the stairs and see if there's something there.

But the agent's main goal is to push the boulder to the fountain. Given the current state, the only possible action that might help is to move north or south around the bars. But based on the map, those directions are blocked. Therefore, the agent might need to accept that this boulder is temporarily stuck and look for another boulder to move.

The observations mention a boulder very near southsoutheast. The agent could move southeast to that location. From (42,10), moving southeast would be to (43,11). Let's see if that's possible. The map at y=11, x=43 is `@` if the agent moved there before, but now it's blocked by bars. So maybe that path is blocked.

Alternatively, the agent could move southwest to (41,9), but that's a wall. This is really challenging.

Given the constraints, the safest action is to move east again, even though it results in hitting bars, but perhaps there's a different interpretation. Alternatively, the agent could try to move north around the bars. But without more information, it's hard to tell.

Wait, the agent's inventory has a potion of extra healing. Using a potion might not help here, but it's an option. However, the task is to push boulders, so using items might not be necessary.

After considering all options, the most logical action is to continue trying to push the boulder in a feasible direction. Since east is blocked by bars, the next best option is to move west to position the boulder differently. But the agent is already west of the boulder. Alternatively, move north or south.

Given that moving south was possible earlier, but now blocked, perhaps the agent should move west to the stairs and then see if there's a way to proceed from there. The stairs are adjacent west at (41,10). Moving west to (41,10), then north or south.

But the agent is already at (41,10). Moving north from there would be to (41,9), a wall. Moving south to (41,11), which might be possible. From there, try to push the boulder east.

Alternatively, the agent could move east again, but that's blocked. This seems like a dead end.

Given the time I've spent and the possible actions, the best choice is to move east one more time, even if it hits a bar, to see if there's a change. Alternatively, move south to explore further.

But based on the current observations, moving east results in ""You cannot pass through the bars,"" so the agent should try a different direction. The only other possible move that might help is to move north or south around the bars. However, moving north is a wall, so moving south to (42,11) might be the only option, even though it's blocked.

Wait, the agent's previous move south was allowed, but now it's blocked. That suggests that the environment might have changed, but in this case, it's probably the same map. Therefore, moving south isn't helpful.

In conclusion, the best action the agent can take is to move east again, even though it's blocked, to see if the game allows it or if there's another way. Alternatively, move west to the stairs and assess from there. But given the information, the most logical action is to move east.

Let's see where I am. I've been moving around trying to get to the boulders and push them onto the fountains. The last few moves were east, but I hit bars, which I can't pass through. The boulder is to the east, but there are bars blocking the path. So maybe I need to find a different direction.

Looking at the map, the cursor is at (42,10). The boulder is adjacent east, so maybe if I can move around the bars. The stairs are up to the west, but not sure if that's useful yet. The fountain is near westnorthwest, but the boulder is east. I tried pushing the boulder east before but got blocked by bars. Maybe I need to move the boulder in a different direction. If I can move north or south around the bars to get the boulder into a position where I can push it towards the fountain.

Wait, there's a boulder very near southsouthwest. Maybe I need to push that one first? Or is the main boulder the one I've been trying to move? The message when I tried pushing said ""With great effort you move the boulder,"" but then subsequent moves were blocked. Maybe I need to check the map again.

Looking at the map, the character is at #<.{..{@#... So the boulder is probably at position (42,10) adjacent east. The bars are all around, making it tricky. Maybe the best approach is to try pushing the boulder north or south around the bars. But the bars are blocking those paths as well. Alternatively, maybe move west to get a different angle.

Wait, the recent moves were east, west, east, etc., getting stuck. The bars are far southsoutheast, so maybe the boulder needs to be pushed towards the fountain in the westnorthwest area. If I can get the boulder to move west, maybe past the bars. But the bars are very near northeast, east, and southeast, so that might not be possible. Alternatively, look for a clear path to the fountain.

Another thought: since the stairs are up west, maybe descending or ascending could change the map? But the problem is Boxoban usually requires pushing boxes to targets, not navigating stairs. Let's focus on the current level.

The key is to push the boulder onto the fountain. The fountain is near westnorthwest, so moving the boulder west towards there. But the bars are blocking the direct path. Maybe I need to move the boulder in a direction that's not blocked by bars. For example, if I can push it north or south around the bars and then west.

But the latest observation says the boulder is adjacent east. So if I'm at (42,10), the boulder is at (43,10). The bars are adjacent northeast, east, and southeast. So pushing the boulder east would hit the bars. Instead, maybe push it north to (43,9) if that's clear. But need to check the map.

Looking at the map, the line at y=9 is ""##########"", which is a wall. So (43,9) is a wall. Can't push there. How about pushing the boulder south to (43,11)? The cursor is at (42,10), so moving south would be y=11. The map at y=11 shows ""##..`.#@.#"" – the '@' is the agent, so (42,11) is where the agent moved before. The boulder is at (43,10). If I try to push it south to (43,11), is that possible?

Looking at the language observation: bars adjacent northeast, east, and southeast. The boulder is at (43,10), adjacent east (bars) and southeast. So pushing south would require checking if there's a space behind the boulder. The cell behind the boulder (south of (43,10)) is (43,11). On the map, at (43,11), there's a '.' which is a floor. So maybe pushing the boulder south to (43,11) is possible, as long as there's no obstacle there.

So the action would be to push the boulder south. In MiniHack, pushing is done by moving in the direction of the object. So to push the boulder south, the agent needs to move south, which would move the boulder south as well, provided the path is clear.

Let me confirm: the agent is at (42,10), boulder at (43,10). To push the boulder south, the agent moves south to (42,11), and the boulder moves to (43,11). Check if (43,11) is a floor. On the map, at y=11, the line is ""##..`.#@.#"", so position (43,11) is the '@' which is the agent's current position. Wait, no. The agent was at (41,11) before moving north to (42,10). Now, the map shows the agent at (42,10). The cell (43,11) on the map might be a different position. Let me parse the map again.

The map's rows are y=0 to y=9, with the agent at (42,10) which is the 11th row (since y starts at 0). The 11th row is ""##..`.#@.#"", which is positions x=0 to x=9. Wait, the map's columns might be x from left to right, and rows from top to bottom. So the agent at (42,10) would be in column 42, row 10. The map's 10th row (0-based index 9?) might need to be checked again.

This is getting a bit confusing. Alternatively, focus on the possible moves. Since the boulder is adjacent east, and the agent is at (42,10), trying to push it south would require the agent to move south, which is allowed if the cell south of the boulder (43,11) is free. If that cell is a floor, then it's possible.

Looking at the language observation: bars adjacent northeast, east, and southeast. The bars are in those directions, but south of the boulder might be clear. The latest message after pushing the boulder said the bars very near include southwest and northwest, but not sure about south.

Alternatively, maybe the agent should try moving north to get a different angle. Or check if there's a fountain nearby that the boulder can be pushed onto. The fountain is near westnorthwest, which is in the opposite direction of the bars. So perhaps the agent needs to move west to approach the boulder from another side.

Wait, the agent is at (42,10), the boulder is at (43,10). To push it west, the agent would need to move west, but the boulder is already adjacent. Pushing west would require the cell (42,10) to be free, but the agent is there. So that's not possible. Alternatively, move the agent north or south around the boulder and then push it west.

But the bars are blocking the north and south directions. Maybe the only option is to push the boulder south around the bars. If the cell (43,11) is free, then that's the way to go. Let's assume it's free and choose to move south to push the boulder there.

Let me try to figure out what to do next in this Boxoban game. The agent has been moving around pushing a boulder, and now it's stuck between some bars. The last few actions were trying to go east, but the bars are blocking the way. The current position is (42, 11), and the map shows that there's a boulder at (42, 10) which the agent just moved there by pushing it north. Now, trying to go east again isn't working because there are bars.

Looking at the map, the agent is at (42,11) and the boulder is at (42,10). The bars are adjacent to the east direction, so moving east isn't possible. The agent needs to find a way to move the boulder further or navigate around the bars. The goal is to push the boulders onto the fountains. There's a fountain at westnorthwest, which might be near the stairs up. 

The previous attempts to go east have hit bars, so maybe moving south or west would be better. Let's check the language observations. The bars are very near northnortheast, southsoutheast, westsouthwest, west, and northwest. The agent is at (42,11), so moving south might lead towards the fountain at westnorthwest. Alternatively, moving west could get closer to the stairs up and maybe find a path around the bars. 

Another option is to check if there's a way to push the boulder south or west. Since the boulder is at (42,10), pushing it south might place it on a fountain. The fountain is near westnorthwest, so if the boulder can be moved southwest towards there, that would solve the problem. However, the current position of the agent is north of the boulder, so to push it south, the agent needs to be south of the boulder. Maybe moving south to (42,11) to (42,10), but the agent is already there. Wait, the agent was at (42,10) after pushing the boulder north. Then moved south back to (42,11). So the boulder is still at (42,10). 

So, if the agent is at (42,11) and the boulder is at (42,10), the agent can try to move south again, but that's where they just came from. Alternatively, move west to (41,11) and see if there's a path. The bars are adjacent to the east, so west might be clearer. Moving west could allow the agent to navigate around the bars and find a way to push the boulder further. 

Alternatively, check if there's a fountain nearby that the boulder can be pushed onto. The fountain is at westnorthwest, which is probably to the northwest direction from the current position. Moving west a few times and then north might lead towards the fountain. But the bars are in the way, so maybe the agent needs to go around them. 

Another thought: since the agent can't go east, moving west to (41,11) and then trying to push the boulder south or west. If the agent is at (41,11), they could try to move the boulder at (42,10) by accessing it from the west. So, move west to (41,11), then maybe move south to (41,10) and push the boulder west to (40,10), placing it on a fountain. 

But wait, the current map shows the boulder at (42,10) after being pushed north from (41,10). The agent moved east to (42,10) and then tried to go further east but hit bars. So, to push the boulder west again, the agent needs to be west of it. So, moving west from (42,10) to (41,10) and then pushing west to (40,10) might work if there's a path. 

But in the latest observation, after pushing the boulder north to (42,10), the agent is at (42,10) and tried to go east but hit bars. Now, in the current state, the agent is at (42,11). So, maybe moving south back to (42,10), then west to (41,10), and then push the boulder west to (40,10) where there's a fountain. 

Alternatively, check if the fountain is at (40,10) or another coordinate. The language observation mentions fountains near westnorthwest, which would be in the northwest direction from the current position. So, moving west and north might be the way. 

Considering all this, the agent needs to find a path to move the boulder towards a fountain. The best immediate action might be to move west from (42,11) to (41,11) to get closer to the boulder at (42,10), then move south to (41,10), and push the boulder west to (40,10) onto the fountain. However, the agent needs to check if that path is clear. 

But given the bars are blocking the east, moving west seems plausible. So the next action could be west to (41,11), then proceed to manipulate the boulder.

Let's try to figure out what's the best move here. The agent is in a Boxoban-like environment, trying to push boulders onto fountains. Looking at the map and observations, there's a boulder adjacent to the east (since the last action was east, but it hit a bar). The agent's current position is (41, 11).

The message after the last attempt to move east says ""You cannot pass through the bars."" So there are bars blocking the way east. The boulder is nearby, maybe to the south or north? The language observation mentions a boulder adjacent south. So the boulder is probably to the south of the agent.

The goal is to push the boulder onto a fountain. The fountains are located at southeast and westnorthwest according to previous observations. The agent needs to navigate to a position where they can push the boulder towards a fountain without hitting bars.

Looking at the map, the agent is at (41,11). The boulder is adjacent south, so at (41,12). The stairs up are at west, so maybe the exit is there, but the priority is pushing the boulder.

The agent should try to move south to position (41,12) where the boulder is. Then, push it further south or in another direction towards a fountain. But need to check if there's space behind the boulder. If moving south into the boulder, the agent can push it if there's no obstacle behind.

Also, the fountains are at westnorthwest, which is probably in the northwest part of the map. The agent might need to move the boulder towards the western area. Alternatively, the southeast fountain is mentioned, so maybe pushing the boulder southeast.

But given the current position, moving south to the boulder and then trying to push it towards the west or southwest might be a way. Let's check the bars around. The language observation says bars adjacent southwest and west. So moving west from (41,11) is blocked by bars. Southwest direction would be (40,10), but not sure if that's clear.

Alternatively, after moving south to (41,12) and pushing the boulder west-southwest towards the fountain at westnorthwest. But need to ensure there's a path. Maybe moving the boulder south first, then west.

So the next steps could be: move south to reach the boulder, then push it south or west. Let's see. The agent is at (41,11). Moving south to (41,12) where the boulder is adjacent. Then, pushing south would be to (41,13). But need to check if there's a obstacle there. The map shows that at (41,13), there's a `#` which might be a wall or bar. If pushing south is possible, that could move the boulder towards the fountain at westnorthwest. Alternatively, pushing west from the boulder's position (41,12) to (40,12), but the bars are adjacent southwest (which would be (40,10)), so maybe not clear.

Alternatively, maybe moving west from the agent's current position (41,11) to (40,11), but that's blocked by bars. So the best option is to go south to the boulder and push it. Let's try that.

19,west,"<reasoning>
The agent is trying to solve a Boxoban-like puzzle where they need to push boulders onto fountains. Let me go through the current observation to understand the situation.

Looking at the cursor position, the agent is at (41,12). The map shows that there's a boulder ('@') at (41, 12) which was just moved south earlier. The message says ""With great effort you move the boulder,"" so that boulder is now one square south from where it was. 

The key elements here are the boulder positions and the fountain locations. From the language observation, the fountains are near southsoutheast and westnorthwest. The bars are obstacles that the agent can't pass through. The agent's current goal is to get all boulders on fountains.

The boulder that was just moved is now at (41,12), but where's the fountain? The fountains are near westnorthwest, which is probably up north. The other fountain is near southsoutheast, which might be further south. The agent needs to check if the current boulder is on a fountain. 

Looking at the map, after moving the boulder south to (41,12), the next step is to determine if that position is a fountain. The map shows a fountain at westnorthwest, but the boulder is now further south. The other fountain is near southsoutheast. So maybe the agent needs to move the boulder towards the westnorthwest fountain.

The agent's current position is (41,12), and the boulder is there. The next action should probably be to move the boulder towards the westnorthwest direction. However, the bars are blocking movement to the east, so maybe the agent needs to go west to reach the stairs up or another path.

Alternatively, the agent might need to check if there's another boulder nearby that hasn't been pushed yet. The language observation mentions a boulder near northnortheast, south, and westnorthwest. The one that was just moved is south, so maybe there's another one to the north that needs to be pushed onto the westnorthwest fountain.

Since the stairs up are far westnorthwest, perhaps the agent should head in that direction to reach the fountain. The agent's current position is south of the boulder, so moving west might help navigate around the bars. Let me check the adjacent positions. 

The bars adjacent are west and northwest. So moving west from (41,12) would take the agent to (40,12), which might be a clear path if there are no bars there. Alternatively, moving northwest to (40,11) could be an option, but the bars are adjacent there. It's safer to go west first.

The agent's goal is to push the boulder onto the fountain at westnorthwest. So after moving the boulder south, the next step is to position it towards that fountain. Moving west might allow the agent to navigate around the bars and approach the boulder again to push it further west.

Another consideration is that the agent might need to pick up the boulder again to push it further. Since the boulder was just moved south, the agent is now next to it. To push it west, the agent would need to move west into the boulder's space, which is possible if there's no obstacle behind it.

Looking at the map, the square west of the boulder (40,12) is probably a floor tile since there's a bar very near to the east. So moving west from (41,12) to (40,12) would allow the agent to push the boulder further west towards the westnorthwest fountain.

Therefore, the best next action is to move west to position the boulder correctly towards the target fountain.

Let's see. The agent is trying to solve Boxoban here. The goal is to push all boulders onto fountains. From the observations, there's a boulder at (41,12) which was moved south previously. The map shows a boulder ( @ ) at position (41,12) and another one adjacent south. The fountains are at westnorthwest, and the agent's current position is (41,12).

Looking at the latest observation, after moving south, the agent tried to go west but hit bars. The boulder was moved south, so maybe the next step is to move the boulder further south towards the fountain. Let's check the map again. The boulder is at (41,12), and the south direction from there is blocked by bars. The adjacent positions to the boulder are south (blocked by bars), north (back to where agent was), west (bars), and east (maybe possible?).

Wait, the message after moving south said ""With great effort you move the boulder."" So the boulder was pushed south to (41,13), but now the agent is at (41,12) and the boulder is at (41,13). But the bars are in south direction at (41,13), so the boulder can't go further south. Maybe need to move it east or west around the bars.

But the bars are blocking east and west. The agent's current position is (41,12). Let me check the cursor position again. Yes, (41,12). The boulder is at (41,13). The bars are south of the boulder. So maybe the agent needs to move the boulder west or east around the bars. But the agent's current position is south of the boulder. To push the boulder west, the agent would have to be to the west of it and move west. But the agent is at (41,12), which is south of the boulder at (41,13). So the agent needs to move north to get beside the boulder again.

Alternatively, perhaps the agent should move east to get around the bars. Let me look at the map. The map shows at position (41,12) the agent is there, and the boulder is at (41,13). The bars are south of the boulder. So the agent is south of the boulder, which is south of the bars. To push the boulder further, maybe the agent needs to move north to (41,11), then try to push east or west. But the bars are south of the boulder, so pushing the boulder south isn't possible anymore. The agent's previous attempts to go east or west hit bars, so maybe moving north to get a better position would help.

Looking at the language observation, the adjacent positions to the boulder (41,13) are south (bars), north (agent's position), west (bars), and east (unknown). Wait, the bars are adjacent to the boulder's south, west, and north? No, the bars adjacent to the boulder's position are south, west, and north? Let me check the latest language observation: ""bars adjacent west and northwest"" for the agent's current position (41,12). The boulder is at (41,13), so its adjacent bars would be south (bars), west (bars?), and north (agent's position). The agent is north of the boulder.

So the agent needs to get around the boulder. Maybe move north first to (41,11), then try to push the boulder east or west. But the bars are in the way. Alternatively, move the boulder west or east around the bars. Let me think: the agent is at (41,12), boulder at (41,13). To push the boulder east, the agent needs to be east of it and move east. But east is blocked by bars. To push west, the agent needs to be west of the boulder and move west. But west is also blocked by bars. So maybe the agent needs to move north to (41,11), then try a different direction.

From (41,11), the agent can try moving east or west. The bars are adjacent to the agent's position (west and northwest). So moving west from (41,11) would hit bars. Moving east might be possible. Let's see: if the agent moves north to (41,11), then east to (42,11), then maybe push the boulder from there. But how?

Alternatively, since the boulder is at (41,13), and the agent is at (41,12), perhaps the agent can move north to (41,11), then west or east. But the bars are west and northwest of the agent. So moving west from (41,11) is blocked. Moving east to (42,11) might be possible if there's no bars. Looking at the map, at (42,11) there's a `@` which is the boulder, but the agent is at (41,12). Wait, maybe the map has some structure I'm not seeing. The map shows a lot of ########## which are walls or bars. The agent is in a corridor perhaps.

Another approach: the fountains are at westnorthwest. The agent is at (41,12), and the boulder needs to get there. The boulder is currently at (41,13), south of the agent. Maybe the agent should push the boulder east or west around the bars. But the bars are in the way. Alternatively, find a path to move the boulder north to a different location where it can be pushed towards the fountain.

Wait, the stairs up are at westnorthwest, which is probably the goal area. The fountains are there. So the boulder needs to be moved to westnorthwest. The boulder is currently at (41,13), which is south of the agent. Maybe the agent can move north to (41,11), then east to (42,11), then push the boulder north or south. But I'm not sure. The bars are south of the boulder, so pushing it further south isn't possible. Maybe push it north towards the stairs.

Alternatively, the agent can move west to get around. Let's think step by step. Current position (41,12), boulder at (41,13). Agent needs to get beside the boulder to push it. To do that, the agent can move north to (41,11), which is possible if there's no obstacle. The map shows at (41,11) there's a `#` which is a wall or bar? The map's ASCII might be a bit unclear. The map has a lot of `#` which are probably walls. The agent's previous movement was allowed, so maybe the path is clear.

Alternatively, maybe the agent should try to move the boulder west. To do that, the agent needs to be west of the boulder. The boulder is at (41,13), so the agent would need to move to (40,13) and then push west. But the agent is currently at (41,12). To get to (40,13), the agent would need to move west to (40,12), then north to (40,13), then push west. But the bars are at west of the agent's current position, so moving west from (41,12) is blocked.

Hmm, this is tricky. The agent is stuck between bars and the boulder. The latest message says the agent cannot pass through bars. The only possible moves might be north, south, east, or west, but some are blocked. Since the agent tried west and got blocked by bars, maybe moving north to (41,11) is the way to go. From there, the agent can try to move east or west. Let's check the language observation: bars adjacent west and northwest for the current position (41,12). So moving west from (41,12) is blocked. Moving north to (41,11), then what? At (41,11), the adjacent bars are west and northwest, so moving west is still blocked. Moving east to (42,11) might be possible if there's no bars. The map shows at (42,11) there's a `@` which is the boulder. Wait, no, the boulder is at (41,13) after being pushed south. The map at (42,11) is `#` perhaps? I'm a bit confused about the map layout.

Alternatively, maybe the agent should try to move the boulder east. To do that, the agent needs to be east of the boulder and push it. The boulder is at (41,13), so the agent would need to be at (42,13) and move east. But the agent is at (41,12), so moving east to (42,12), then north to (42,13), then push east. However, the bars are adjacent east and southeast, so moving east from (42,12) might be blocked.

This is getting complicated. Maybe the best move is to move north to (41,11) to get a better vantage point and then try a different direction. Let's proceed with that.

The agent is trying to solve Boxoban by pushing boulders onto fountains. In the previous steps, the agent moved around, pushing a boulder east a few times, but encountered bars (which are walls or obstacles) that blocked the way. The latest observation shows the agent is at (41,11) looking north, and there's a boulder adjacent to the south.

The map shows that there's a boulder at (41,10) which was pushed there earlier. The agent needs to get this boulder onto a fountain. Looking at the language observations, there's a fountain very near the west, and another fountain near southsoutheast and westnorthwest. The bars are mostly in the south and west directions.

The current position is (41,11). The boulder is south of the agent. To push the boulder further south, the agent needs to move south, but there's a bar to the southsouthwest. Wait, the bars are far southsoutheast and others, but adjacent areas might have walls. The agent tried moving east but hit bars, so maybe moving west isn't possible either. North is where the agent came from. 

Looking at the map, the agent is facing north at position (41,11). The boulder is at (41,10). To push it further south, the agent needs to move south, but the path might be blocked by bars. Alternatively, maybe the boulder can be pushed east or west around the bars. However, previous attempts to move east hit bars, so perhaps the best approach is to try pushing the boulder south again. 

Wait, the message after moving south last time was ""With great effort you move the boulder,"" which means it succeeded. But after that, the agent tried moving east but couldn't. Now, the agent is back at (41,11), and the boulder is at (41,10). Maybe the next step is to move south again to push the boulder further towards the fountain. But the observation mentions bars adjacent west and southwest. If there's a bar to the southwest, pushing the boulder south might not be possible unless there's space. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent should move north to reposition. But the agent was just north of the boulder. Another option is to check if there's a path east around the bars. Since the agent couldn't move east earlier due to bars, perhaps the bars are blocking that way. The agent needs to find a way to maneuver the boulder towards the fountain. 

Looking at the fountains, the closest one is near westnorthwest. The boulder is at (41,10). To get it to the westnorthwest fountain, the agent might need to move it west first. But the agent is at (41,11), so moving west would take them to (40,11), but there's a bar there. Wait, the language observation says bars adjacent southwest and west. So at (41,11), moving west would hit a bar. Therefore, the agent can't move west directly. 

Maybe the agent should move south again to push the boulder further south, then see if there's a path east or west from there. If the boulder is pushed south to (41,9), perhaps there's space to move east around the bars. Alternatively, moving the boulder west towards the fountain. But given the current position, pushing south might be the only option. 

Alternatively, check if the boulder can be pushed east around the bars. The agent was at (41,11) and tried moving east but hit bars. Maybe the bars are at (42,11). So pushing the boulder east from (41,10) would take it to (42,10), which might be possible if there's no obstacle there. Wait, the map shows at position (42,10) there's a `@` which is the agent, and the boulder was at (41,10). After pushing, the boulder would be at (42,10). But the agent is at (41,11), so to push the boulder east, the agent needs to be adjacent. 

The agent is at (41,11), and the boulder is at (41,10). The agent is north of the boulder. To push the boulder east, the agent needs to move east, but there's a bar at (42,11). So that's not possible. Therefore, the agent can't push the boulder east from this position. 

So the best option is to move south to (41,10) and push the boulder further south. But the agent is already at (41,11), and the boulder is at (41,10). So moving south would allow the agent to be south of the boulder, then push it south again. However, the observation says there's a bar far southsoutheast, so pushing beyond that might not be possible. 

Alternatively, perhaps there's a different boulder elsewhere. The latest message after moving south previously was that the boulder was moved, but now the agent needs to check if there are other boulders. The current language observation mentions a boulder near south and westsouthwest. The agent's current focus is on the boulder at (41,10). 

Given the constraints, the next logical step is to move south to push the boulder further towards the fountain. Even if there's a bar eventually, the agent needs to keep pushing it as far as possible. So the action should be south.

",-0.001,False
22,south,"<reasoning>
The agent is trying to solve Boxoban, pushing boulders onto fountains. From the history, the agent has been moving around trying to navigate the map. The latest observation shows the agent is at (41,12) and the boulder is at (41,11) with the message that pushing it south worked before. The map shows a boulder ( @ ) at position (41,11) according to the map.

The current goal is to push the boulder onto the fountain. The fountain is marked as { or } perhaps? Looking at the language observation, there's a fountain near southsoutheast and westnorthwest. The map shows a fountain as {..@`.# etc., so maybe the fountains are the { symbols.

The agent's position is (41,12), and the boulder is one unit north at (41,11). To push the boulder south onto the fountain, the agent needs to move south into the boulder. The previous actions show attempts to move east and west but were blocked by bars. Now, since the boulder is north of the agent, moving south into it would push it further south. The next step is to check if there's a clear path south from the boulder's current position (41,11) to a fountain.

The map at (41,11) shows `# in the next position south. If pushing the boulder south from (41,11) to (41,12), but wait, the agent is already at (41,12). Wait, no—the agent is at (41,12), and the boulder is at (41,11). So the agent needs to move south into the boulder at (41,11), which would push it to (41,12). But looking at the map, at (41,12) there's a @, which might be the boulder after being pushed. Wait, the map shows the agent's position as < at (41,41) initially, but in the latest map, the agent is at (41,12) with the map line:

##..###@.# 

So positions in that line are (41,10) to (41,15) perhaps. The boulder is at (41,11) (the @ symbol), and the agent is at (41,12). To push the boulder south, the agent needs to move south (from 12 to 13?), but the map's next line after that is ##.###.`.#, which might indicate obstacles. If moving south into the boulder at (41,11) would push it to (41,12), but the agent is already there. Maybe the map's representation is a bit different. Alternatively, perhaps the boulder needs to be pushed further south beyond the agent's current position.

Alternatively, maybe the agent should position themselves north of the boulder and then push it south. But in the current position, the agent is south of the boulder. So to push the boulder south, the agent needs to move into the boulder's current position. So the action should be south, moving into the boulder at (41,11), which is one step north of the agent's current position (41,12). Wait, that doesn't make sense. The agent is at (41,12), the boulder is at (41,11). So the agent is south of the boulder. To push the boulder south, the agent needs to move south into the boulder. But the agent's current position is (41,12), moving south would take them to (41,13). However, the boulder is at (41,11), so that path isn't directly towards the boulder. Maybe the agent needs to move north to get above the boulder and then push it south. But the agent was previously at (41,11) and moved south to (41,12). 

Wait, the latest observation after moving south had the message ""With great effort you move the boulder."" but in the current state, the agent is back at (41,11) after moving north. Now, the boulder is at (41,11) adjacent east. So perhaps the correct move is to go east and push the boulder further. But earlier attempts to move east were blocked by bars. Alternatively, the agent needs to find a path to the fountain where the boulder can be pushed. 

Looking at the language observation, there's a fountain near westnorthwest. The agent's current position is (41,12). The stairs up are far westnorthwest, which might be the exit, but the goal is to push the boulder onto a fountain. The fountain's location might be at a specific coordinate. The map shows fountains as { symbols. For example, in the map, the line with the agent is #<.{..{.@# which might indicate a fountain ({..) near the agent's position. 

Wait, the map line for y=10 is ##{..##..# which has a { near the start. Maybe the agent needs to get the boulder to that area. But the boulder is currently at (41,11), and pushing it further south might reach the fountain. However, the map's next line after y=11 (where the boulder is) is ##..###@.#, which at position (41,12) has a @, indicating the boulder after being pushed. Then the line for y=12 is ##..###@.#, and y=13 is ##.###.`.#. If the boulder is pushed further south to y=13, does that reach a fountain? The fountain is near southsoutheast and westnorthwest. Maybe the agent needs to push the boulder towards the westnorthwest direction. 

Alternatively, the agent could move west to get next to the boulder and then push it southwest towards the fountain. But the previous attempts to move west were blocked by bars. The bars are in various directions, so the agent needs to find an unblocked path. 

Considering the latest observation, the agent is at (41,11), and the boulder is adjacent east (since in the map, the @ is at (41,11) in the line ##..###@.#). So the boulder is to the east of the agent. To push it further east, the agent would need to move east into the boulder, but that's blocked by bars. So instead, the agent should move south to get behind the boulder and then push it south. 

Wait, the agent is at (41,11), and the boulder is at (41,11) in the east direction. So if the agent moves south to (41,12), which is where the @ is in the next map line, but that's the boulder's new position after being pushed. Hmm, perhaps the correct action is to move south into the boulder, which would push it to (41,12). Then, check if (41,12) is a fountain. But according to the map, at (41,12) there's a ` which might be a wall or obstacle. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent should move west to get next to the boulder and then push it west towards the fountain. But the bars are preventing that. 

Looking at the language observation, the fountain is adjacent to westnorthwest. The agent's current position is (41,11). The westnorthwest direction from here would be towards (40,10) perhaps. The boulder needs to be pushed to that area. 

Given the barriers, the best approach might be to push the boulder south as much as possible. Each time the agent moves south into the boulder, it gets pushed further. The previous successful push was when the agent moved south, so repeating that action could work. However, the agent is already at (41,12) after moving south once. Maybe the boulder can be pushed further south into a fountain. 

Alternatively, the agent should check if the position where the boulder is going to be pushed is a fountain. If the next move south into the boulder leads to a fountain, then that's the solution. Given the map's symbols, the fountains are likely the { symbols. The agent's current map shows a { in the line ##{..##..# at the beginning (position x=40, y=10). So pushing the boulder towards that area could be the way. 

The agent is at (41,11), and the boulder is at (41,11) east. To move the boulder west towards the {, the agent would need to go west, but that's blocked by bars. So instead, the agent needs to find a path that allows pushing the boulder south or southwest. 

Another option is to climb stairs up if that's a shortcut, but the goal is to push the boulder onto a fountain. The stairs are at westnorthwest, which might be a different location. 

Considering all this, the most straightforward action is to continue moving south to push the boulder further south, hoping it reaches a fountain. The previous action of south worked, so repeating it might be the next step.

Let's see what's going on here. The agent is in a Boxoban-like game trying to push boulders onto fountains. The current observation shows that the agent moved the boulder previously, which is good. Now, looking at the map, the boulder is now at position (41,13) with the '@' symbol. The fountains are near westnorthwest and southeast. The bars are still blocking some paths.

The agent's current position is (41,13). The message says they moved the boulder, so the boulder is now here. The goal is to get it onto a fountain. The nearest fountain mentioned is adjacent southeast. So maybe moving east or south to reach that fountain.

Looking at the map, the agent is in a corridor. To the east, there might be a path. Let me check the map again. The line with @ is in the sixth position (since y=13 is the sixth row from the top in the map output). The map shows `##.###.@.#` which suggests that to the east of the @ is a '.' (floor), then more Walls ('#'). So moving east from (41,13) would be possible if there's a floor there. Wait, the @ is at position (41,13), which in the map is the 7th character in that row (since each row is a string). The line is `##.###.@.#`, so positions 0 to 8 (assuming 9 characters). The @ is at index 6. So east would be index 7, which is a '.', so that's a floor. So moving east is possible. Then, from there, maybe proceed further east to reach the fountain southeast. Alternatively, moving south might lead to a fountain.

Wait, the language observation says ""fountain adjacent southeast"". The agent is at (41,13). Southeast would be down and right. But the current map shows that moving east from (41,13) is possible. Maybe the southeast fountain is in that direction. Alternatively, perhaps the agent needs to move south to get closer to the fountain.

But the agent just pushed the boulder here, so the next step is to see if this position is on a fountain. The current map doesn't show a fountain at (41,13), but the language observation mentions ""fountain adjacent southeast"". So maybe after moving east or south, the boulder can be positioned on the fountain.

Since the boulder is now at (41,13), moving east to (42,13) might be a good idea to head towards the southeast fountain. Alternatively, moving south to (41,14) could also be necessary. However, looking at the map, moving south from (41,13) would go into a row that's all Walls from the start: `##########`, so that's blocked. Therefore, moving south isn't possible. So the best option is to move east to (42,13) and then proceed further east or south-east to reach the fountain.

Alternatively, check if there's a path east. The map shows that in the row y=13, after the @, there's a '.' and then more '#', so moving east once is possible. Let's confirm the coordinates. The agent is at (41,13). Moving east would take them to (42,13). The map at that position is a '.', so that's valid. From there, maybe move east again to get closer to the fountain. The language observation says the fountain is adjacent southeast, which from (42,13) would be (43,14), but we need to check if there's a path.

Alternatively, after moving east to (42,13), the agent could move south to (42,14), but looking at the map's next row (y=14) for that column, it's all Walls. So that's not possible. Therefore, the best immediate action is to move east to (42,13) to get closer to the fountain in the southeast direction. Once there, perhaps another push is needed to get the boulder onto the fountain.

Another possibility: The boulder is now at (41,13). If the fountain is adjacent southeast, then moving the boulder east and then south might place it on the fountain. But since the agent just moved the boulder here, they need to position it correctly. Maybe the next step is to move east to (42,13) and then push the boulder further east, but the current boulder is already here. Wait, no—the boulder was moved to (41,13) in the previous action. So now the agent is at (41,13) next to the boulder. To push the boulder further, the agent needs to move into it from the west. But since the agent is already west of the boulder, maybe they can push it east.

Wait, the agent is at (41,13), and the boulder is also at (41,13) after being pushed. So the agent is on the same tile as the boulder. To push it further east, the agent needs to move east into the boulder, provided there's an empty space beyond. From (41,13) east to (42,13) is a '.', so yes. So the agent can push the boulder east to (42,13) by moving east twice: once to get next to the boulder, but wait, the agent is already next to it. Wait, no—the agent is at (41,13), and the boulder is also there. So to push the boulder east, the agent needs to move east into the boulder's tile, which would move the boulder to (42,13). So the correct action is to move east again.

But in the current observation, after moving the boulder to (41,13), the agent is there. So the next action should be to move east to push it further. Let me check the map again. The agent is at (41,13), and moving east would take them to (42,13), which is a floor. So the action should be east to push the boulder to (42,13). That would get the boulder closer to the southeast fountain mentioned in the language observation. Once there, perhaps another push south-east, but need to check for obstacles.

Alternatively, maybe the southeast fountain is in the next row. Let's see. The agent is at (41,13). Moving east to (42,13), then moving south to (42,14) is blocked by walls. So maybe the fountain is to the east and then north? Not sure. Alternatively, the agent needs to navigate around the bars to reach the fountain.

But given the current position and the immediate options, the best action is to move east to push the boulder further towards the southeast fountain. So the next action should be east.

Let me try to figure out what to do next. The goal is to push all the boulders onto the fountains. From the current state, the agent is at (42, 13) facing a boulder marked with '@' on the map. The map shows that there's a fountain at northnorthwest, which is probably westnorthwest direction from the current position.

Looking at the observations, there's a boulder adjacent to the southwest. Wait, the boulder was moved south twice before, and now it's at (41, 13). But the agent is at (42, 13). So the boulder is to the west of the agent. The message says ""With great effort you move the boulder"" when the agent tried to push it south earlier. Now, the agent is facing south again?

Wait, the latest action was 'east', moving to (42,13). Now the boulder is at (41,13) since it was moved south. The agent is at (42,13). To push the boulder further south, the agent needs to move south and then push. But first, maybe check if there's a clear path.

The language observation mentions a fountain adjacent to the northwest. The agent is at (42,13), so northwest would be (41,12). But there's a bar there, right? The bars adjacent southwest and northwest. Wait, the bars are near westsouthwest, west, and westnorthwest. The current position's bars are adjacent southwest and northwest. So maybe moving west would hit a bar, but moving northwest might be a bar as well. 

The goal is to get the boulder to the fountain. The fountain is at westnorthwest, which from (42,13) would be moving west twice to (40,13), then north to (40,12), but the map shows fountains near westnorthwest. Alternatively, the fountain might be at (41,11) or similar. 

Looking at the map, the fountain is adjacent to northwest. The agent's current position is (42,13). The northwest direction from here is (41,12). But there's a bar adjacent there. So maybe the path isn't clear. However, the boulder is at (41,13). To push it further south, the agent needs to be next to it and push. 

Wait, the agent is at (42,13) and the boulder is at (41,13). So they are adjacent. To push the boulder south, the agent needs to move south into the boulder's position. Then the boulder would move south to (41,14). But is there a space there? The map shows nothing specific at (41,14), but there might be bars or other obstacles. 

The latest observation after moving the boulder south said ""With great effort you move the boulder,"" so it was possible before. Now, after moving east to (42,13), the agent is next to the boulder. So the next step is to push the boulder south again. That would be the action 'south'. But need to check if the path is clear. 

The bars are far southsouthwest, etc., but the immediate area south of the boulder (41,14) might be clear. Since the agent successfully pushed it before, it's likely possible again. So the action should be 'south' to push the boulder further south towards the fountain.

Let's try to figure out the best move here. The agent is trying to push a boulder onto a fountain in Boxoban. The current position is (42,14). The map shows that there's a boulder at (41,12) and another at (42,13) after moving it south. The goal is to get the boulders onto the fountains.

Looking at the language observations, there's a fountain very near westnorthwest and another at southsoutheast. The fountains adjacent northwest might be a target. The bars are blocking some paths, especially to the west. The agent recently moved a boulder south to (42,13), so maybe pushing it further south towards the fountain would work. But need to check if there's a path. The map shows that at (42,13), there's a boulder, and the agent is now at (42,14). If the agent moves south again, they can push the boulder further. Let me verify the map layout:

The map's line for y=13 has ##.###..@# which indicates the boulder is at (42,13). The agent is at (42,14). To push the boulder south, the agent needs to move into it. Moving south from (42,14) would take the agent to (42,15), but the map shows the next line as #######..#, which is obstacles. Wait, perhaps the boulder is at (42,13), and moving south from there would require the agent to be adjacent. Wait, the agent's current position is (42,14), and the boulder is at (42,13). So the agent is north of the boulder. To push the boulder south, the agent needs to move south into the boulder's tile. But the observation after moving south previously said ""With great effort you move the boulder."" So maybe the agent is positioned to push it again. Let's check the latest map. At y=13, the boulder is at (42,13), and the agent is at (42,14). If the agent moves south to (42,15), but the map shows that line as #######..#, which are bars or obstacles. So can't go further south. Alternatively, maybe the agent should move east or west to position near another fountain. Alternatively, check if there's a path to the westnorthwest fountain. The stairs are up there, but the goal is to push boulders on fountains. The agent needs to find a path to a fountain where the boulder can be placed. Given the barriers, the best bet might be to push the boulder towards the northwest fountain. To do that, the agent needs to move west from (42,14) to get closer. Alternatively, move north to get a better angle. Wait, the boulder is at (42,13). If the agent moves west to (41,14), then they can try to push the boulder southwest towards the fountain. Let me see the map again. At (41,13), there's a `@` which might be another boulder or maybe a different object. The map shows at y=13, the line is ##.###...# for y=12, then ##.###..@# for y=13, and #######`@# for y=14. Wait, perhaps the agent is pushing the boulder from (42,13) south, but the next tile is blocked. So maybe the correct move is to move west to get the boulder into a position where it can be pushed towards the fountain. Alternatively, check the adjacent tiles. The agent is at (42,14). The boulder is at (42,13). To push it south, the agent needs to move south into it, but the tile south of (42,13) is #######..# which is a barrier. Therefore, can't push further south. So maybe the agent should move west to (41,14) and then try to push the boulder west or southwest. Alternatively, check if there's a fountain nearby. The fountain adjacent northwest is at (41,12) perhaps. The agent could move west to (41,14) and then north to (41,13) to get near the boulder. Alternatively, move south to (42,15) but that's blocked. Hmm. The best action might be to move west to position near the boulder and then push it towards the fountain. So the next action should be west.

Let's try to figure out the best move here. The agent is in a Boxoban-like environment, pushing a boulder onto a fountain. From the history, the agent has been trying to move around the bars and boulders, but sometimes hits walls or can't move the boulder because there's something blocking it.

Looking at the last observation, the agent is at (42,14) and just tried to push the boulder west but failed. The message says they couldn't move it, probably because there's a bar or another obstacle behind the boulder. The boulder is adjacent to west and southwest, so maybe the bar is on the other side of the boulder.

The map shows the boulder at (42,14) marked with `@`. The cursor is also there. The goal is to get the boulder onto the fountain, which is at westnorthwest. The stairs up are there too, but the priority is pushing the boulder to the fountain.

The agent needs to position itself so they can push the boulder towards the fountain. Since moving west wasn't working, maybe try moving south to get around the barrier? Alternatively, check if there's an open path east or north to reposition. But the previous attempts to move east hit bars. Maybe moving north could help, or west again but perhaps in a different direction.

Wait, in the current position, the agent is at (42,14). The boulder is here. If the agent moves south, they might be able to get behind the boulder if possible, but the map shows that moving south from (42,14) might lead to a different part of the map. Let me check the map structure. The map has a lot of walls (bars/##########) and some open areas. The fountain is westnorthwest, so likely to the upper left from the agent's current position.

Alternatively, the agent could try moving northwest or westnorthwest directions to reach the fountain. But the bars are blocking east and some other directions. Maybe the agent needs to go around the bars by moving north or south first. For example, moving north from (42,14) might take them into a corridor where they can then move west towards the fountain.

But looking at the language observation, the bars are very near northeast, east, and southeast, which means those directions are blocked. The dark areas are also in those directions. So moving north, west, or south might be possible. Wait, the agent just tried west and it didn't work because the boulder is there. Maybe the agent should try moving south to get to a spot where they can push the boulder west?

Looking at the map again, the current position is at row 14 (assuming y increases downward). The fountain is at westnorthwest, which would be up and to the left. So moving northwest from the current position might be the way. But the agent is at (42,14), so northwest would be (41,13). Let me check if that's possible.

The cursor is at (42,14), and the map shows that at (41,13) there's a `@` (boulder) and `...` maybe. Wait, the map shows the agent's position with `<` maybe? Let me recheck the map from the latest observation:

map:
                                  ##########                                    
                                  ##{..##.`#                                    
                                  #<.{..{..#                                    
                                  ##..`.#..#                                    
                                  ##..###..#                                    
                                  ##.###...#                                    
                                  #######`@#                                    
                                  #######`.#                                    
                                  #######..#                                    
                                  ##########                                    
                                                                                
The `<` might be at position (41,11) based on previous observations, but in the latest map, the agent is at (42,14), which would correspond to the line with `#######`... perhaps. The exact map parsing is tricky without coordinates, but the key is that the agent is surrounded by bars on some sides and needs to navigate to push the boulder to the fountain.

Another approach: since pushing the boulder didn't work west, maybe try moving north to get a different angle. If the agent moves north from (42,14) to (42,13), perhaps they can then move west to push the boulder. But looking at the previous moves, moving north from (42,12) led to (42,11), then south again. The bars are a significant obstacle.

Alternatively, the agent might need to find an open path to the northwest. Since the stairs are up at westnorthwest, maybe the fountain is there too. The agent should focus on getting the boulder to that area. Given that pushing west didn't work, perhaps repositioning to the north or east (if possible) to find a way to push the boulder westward.

Wait, the inventory shows a blessed potion of extra healing and other items, but since it's a box-pushing game, items might not be relevant except for using the potion if health is low, which it's not. The main task is moving the boulder.

Looking at the latest language observation: boulder adjacent southwest and west. So the boulder is at (42,14), and there's a barrier to the west (the bar). So the agent is next to the boulder, which is blocked by a bar. To push the boulder west, the agent would need to be behind it, but the bar is in the way. Therefore, the agent needs to move around the boulder to a position where they can push it west.

Possible moves: move north to (42,13), then west to (41,13) to get behind the boulder? But the map shows `#######` at row 7, which might be walls. Alternatively, move south to (42,15) if possible. But the agent's current position is at y=14, and the map's lower rows might be walls.

Alternatively, the agent could try moving east, but previous attempts hit bars. Maybe there's a different path. Wait, the bars are very near northeast, east, and southeast, so moving east is blocked. The agent needs to go west around the boulder but can't because of the bar. So perhaps the only option is to move north or south to find an alternative path.

Given that moving west didn't work, maybe the agent should move north to (42,13) and then try to push the boulder west from there. But how? If the agent is at (42,13) and the boulder is at (42,14), they would need to be north of the boulder to push it south, but the goal is to push it west. Alternatively, if the agent moves east to (43,14), but that's blocked by bars.

Alternatively, the agent could move south to (42,15) and see if there's a path west from there. But without knowing the exact map layout beyond what's provided, it's challenging. The key is that the agent needs to position themselves adjacent to the boulder on the side opposite the barrier (west) so they can push it.

Given the current position and the barriers, the best move might be to move north to (42,13) to see if there's a clear path west from there. Alternatively, check if moving southwest is possible. But the language observation mentions bars adjacent southwest and west, so moving southwest might hit a bar.

Another angle: since the boulder is at (42,14), and the agent is there, maybe the agent needs to step back east to (43,14) to get a better angle, but that's blocked by bars. So perhaps the only option is to move north and then try to push the boulder west from a different position.

In the previous steps, the agent moved south multiple times, perhaps getting stuck. Maybe now moving north could help. Let's choose north as the next action to see if that opens up a path.

The agent is stuck trying to move the boulder in Boxoban. The boulder is adjacent to the agent, and when they try to move east, they hit bars. The last message says they tried to move the boulder but couldn't. Maybe the boulder is blocked by something else. The map shows a boulder (@) at position (41,12) after moving south. The agent is at (41,12) then moves south to (41,13), then east to (42,13), then south to (42,14), west back to (42,14), and north to (42,13). The boulder is at (41,13) in the map. The bars are all around, making it hard to push the boulder. Maybe the boulder needs to be pushed into the fountain at westnorthwest. The stairs are up there too. Since the bars are blocking most directions, the agent might need to find a way around the bars to position the boulder towards the fountain. The agent is at (42,13) now. To the west is a boulder. Maybe push it west into the fountain. But the bars are adjacent southwest and northwest. If the agent moves west from (42,13), they'd hit the bars. Need to check the map again. The map shows a `@` at (41,12) after moving south. Then when the agent moves south to (41,13), there's a `@` at (41,13). Then east to (42,13), and the map has `@` at (42,13). So the boulder is at (42,13). The agent is trying to move it south, but perhaps the path is blocked by bars. The fountain is westnorthwest. The agent's current position is (42,13). To push the boulder west into the fountain, they need to be adjacent to it. The boulder is at (42,13), so the agent is east of it. If the agent moves west, they'd be at (41,13), but there's a bar adjacent southwest and northwest. Wait, the language observation mentions bars adjacent southwest and northwest. So the agent is at (42,13), and trying to move west into the boulder at (42,13)'s west position, which is (41,13), but there's a bar there. So maybe the boulder can't be moved west because there's a bar. Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to move north or south to position the boulder away from the bars. Let's see. The boulder is at (42,13). To push it into the fountain at westnorthwest, the agent needs to move it west, then maybe north or south. But the bars are blocking. Alternatively, maybe the agent can move the boulder south into a position where it's clear. Wait, the agent tried moving south before, but the boulder was already there. The last message was ""With great effort you move the boulder"" when moving south, so the boulder moved to (41,13). Then when trying to move it again, perhaps it's blocked by bars. The bars are very near northeast, east, southeast, southsoutheast, southwest, westsouthwest, west, and northwest. So pushing the boulder west would hit the bars. Therefore, the agent needs to find another direction. Maybe push the boulder north? The agent is at (42,13). If they move north to (42,12), then try to push the boulder north to (42,11), which might be clear. Let's check the map. At (42,12), the agent was there before. The map shows a `@` at (42,13) now. So if the agent moves north to (42,12), then they can push the boulder north. The bars adjacent there are northeast, east, and southeast. So pushing north from (42,13) to (42,12) would be possible if there's no obstacle. But the agent needs to be adjacent to the boulder. Wait, the boulder is at (42,13), so the agent is at (42,13). To push the boulder north, the agent needs to be north of it. Wait, no. To push a boulder, the agent must be next to it and move in a direction where there's space behind. So if the agent is at (42,13) and the boulder is also at (42,13), that can't be. Wait, no, looking back, when the agent moved south to (41,13), the boulder was there. Then when they moved east to (42,13), the boulder was at (42,13). So the agent is on top of the boulder? Or adjacent? Probably adjacent. In Boxoban, pushing a boulder requires being next to it and moving in a direction where there's space behind. If the agent is at (42,13) and the boulder is at (42,13), that suggests the agent is on top of it, which isn't possible. Maybe there's a mistake in the map parsing. Alternatively, the boulder is at (41,13) and the agent is at (42,13). In that case, the agent can push the boulder west to (41,13), but there's a bar there. So perhaps the agent needs to move the boulder in another direction. If the agent moves north to (42,12), then they can push the boulder north to (42,11), which might be clear. Let's check the map at (42,11). The map shows `#` walls, so maybe it's blocked. Alternatively, the agent can try to move east again, but the bars are there. Maybe the only way is to find a path around the bars to position the boulder towards the fountain. The fountain is at westnorthwest, which is probably (1,1) or similar coordinates, but the exact location isn't clear from the map. Given the current position and the bars, the best action might be to try pushing the boulder north into a clear spot. So the agent should move north to (42,12) and then try to push the boulder north again. Alternatively, since the last move was south and the boulder is now at (41,13), the agent could move west to (41,13) and try pushing the boulder further west, but there are bars. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the agent should move west to avoid the bars and find a different path. Given the previous attempts and the current position, the best action is probably to move north to create space to push the boulder. So the next action would be north.

Let's see where I am. I'm in Boxoban, trying to push boulders onto fountains. The player's position is at (42, 12). The map shows some bars and fountains. The main goal is to get the boulders on the fountains.

Looking at the previous actions, I've been moving around a lot, trying to navigate the bars. The latest observation says there's a boulder adjacent north. The message when trying to push it before said ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain,"" which might mean there's something blocking it, like another boulder or a wall. 

In the current map, the boulder is at position (42,11) since the agent is at (42,12). The fountain is at westnorthwest, which is probably near the stairs up. The bars are around, so movement is limited. 

The inventory has some useful items, but I don't think they're needed here. The key is to push the boulder onto the fountain. Since the last attempt to push north failed, maybe the boulder is stuck because there's no space behind it. I need to check if there's a path behind the boulder. 

Looking at the map, the agent is at (42,12) with a boulder at (42,11). To the north of the agent is the boulder. If I move north again, I might be pushing the boulder further north, but I need to see if there's a fountain there. The fountain is westnorthwest, so maybe moving west from the boulder's position would lead to the fountain. 

Alternatively, perhaps moving west from the agent's current position could allow repositioning. Let me think: if I go west to (41,12), then north to (41,11), which has a boulder there. Wait, in the current observation, the boulder is adjacent north, so maybe moving north again is necessary. But the last attempt failed. Maybe there's another boulder in the way. 

Looking at the language observation, there's a boulder near southsouthwest and westsouthwest. Maybe the agent needs to move in a different direction to free up the path. 

Another possibility is that the boulder is stuck against a bar or a wall. The bars are very near northeast, east, and southeast, so maybe the boulder is against a bar. If that's the case, pushing it won't work. The agent might need to move around to a different side to push it. 

Since the previous attempts to push north didn't work, perhaps moving west and then trying another direction could help. Let's try moving west to (41,12) and then see if we can push the boulder from there. Alternatively, moving south to (42,13) and then trying north again. 

But the agent is already at (42,12), and moving south would be (42,13), which might not help. Alternatively, moving east to (43,12) but there are bars adjacent northeast, east, and southeast, so that's blocked. 

Wait, the bars are adjacent northeast, east, and southeast, so moving east isn't possible. The best bet might be to move west to (41,12) and then try to navigate around. Let's check the map again. At (41,12), there's a boulder at (41,11) according to the previous observations. So moving west from (42,12) to (41,12) and then south to (41,13) might be an option. 

Alternatively, since the fountain is westnorthwest, the agent should try to head west and north. But the bars are blocking that path. Maybe pushing the boulder towards the fountain by moving it northwestern direction. 

Another approach: check if there's a clear path from the boulder to the fountain. The fountain is at westnorthwest, so from the boulder's current position (assuming it's at (42,11)), moving west and north might reach the fountain. But if there are bars in the way, that's not possible. 

Given the limited information, the safest action might be to continue trying to push the boulder north, but since that failed before, maybe moving in another direction. Perhaps moving west and then trying to push the boulder from there. 

So, the next action could be west to (41,12), then check the surroundings. Alternatively, move south to (42,13) and see if there's a way to reposition. 

But considering the previous actions and the lack of progress, perhaps the best immediate action is to try pushing the boulder again in a different direction. Maybe moving northwest? But the movement options are only north, south, east, west. 

Alternatively, maybe the boulder is stuck against a bar, so the agent needs to move around it. If the agent moves west to (41,12), then perhaps the boulder at (41,11) can be pushed north or west. 

Wait, in the current observation, the boulder is adjacent north, which would be at (42,11). So the boulder is one square north of the agent. To push it further north, the agent needs to be north of the boulder, but the agent is already at (42,12), so pushing north would require the agent to be at (42,11) to push it to (42,10). But the agent is at (42,12), so moving north would take the agent to (42,11), which has the boulder. So maybe the agent needs to move north into the boulder's position and then push it. 

Wait, no. In Boxoban, you push a boulder by moving into it, which then moves the boulder in the direction you came from. So if the agent is at (42,12) and the boulder is at (42,11), to push the boulder north, the agent needs to move north into (42,11), which has the boulder, causing it to move to (42,10). But if there's a barrier at (42,10), that won't work. 

The problem might be that (42,10) is blocked by a bar or another boulder. The agent needs to ensure that the space behind the boulder is clear. 

Given the previous messages, when the agent tried to push the boulder north, it failed, which indicates that the space behind is blocked. So the agent needs to reposition to a different direction where the boulder can be pushed towards the fountain. 

Looking at the fountain's location at westnorthwest, perhaps moving west from the agent's current position (42,12) to (41,12), then north to (41,11) (where the boulder is), and then try to push it west or north. 

Alternatively, moving west to (41,12) and then south to (41,13) to see if there's a path. 

But given the time spent and the lack of progress, maybe the best immediate action is to continue trying to push the boulder in the same direction but from a different position. 

So, the next action is to move north into the boulder's position at (42,11) to attempt pushing it again. However, since the previous attempt failed, maybe there's another obstacle. Alternatively, move west to (41,12) and then try pushing the boulder from there. 

Alternatively, check if there's a clear path to the fountain by moving west and north. 

Given the current map and observations, the most logical step is to move north into the boulder's position to try pushing it again, but considering the previous failure, maybe a different approach is needed. 

Another possibility is that the boulder is already on a fountain, but the observation doesn't indicate that. The fountains are at westnorthwest, so the agent needs to get the boulder there. 

Given the constraints, the next action is to move west to (41,12), then north to (41,11) to interact with the boulder there and attempt to push it west towards the fountain.

Let's see. I need to push a boulder onto the fountain. The agent is at (42,11). The last move was north to (42,11). The map shows a boulder adjacent with a @ symbol at (41,12) when they pushed it south earlier. Now, looking at the current map, the boulder is at (41,12) after being pushed. The goal is to get it to the fountain, which is westnorthwest according to the language observations.

The map shows `#####@{#` at position 7, which might be the fountain. The agent is at (42,11), so to reach the fountain westnorthwest, maybe moving west and then north? But there are bars blocking the way. The previous attempts to go west hit bars. Maybe need to find another path.

The boulder is at (41,12). To push it further west or north? The fountain is westnorthwest, so perhaps moving the boulder west from (41,12) to (40,12), then north to (40,11). But the agent is at (42,11). How to get to the boulder's position? Maybe move west to 41,11, then north to 41,12, and push again. But the bars are in the way. Alternatively, check if there's a way around the bars to access the boulder.

Wait, the latest observation after moving north to (42,11) shows the boulder at (41,12). The agent is at (42,11). To reach the boulder, need to move west to 41,11, then north to 41,12. But can the agent get past the bars? The language observations mention bars adjacent southwest and west. Maybe the agent can't go directly west from (42,11) because of bars. So maybe need to go around via other directions.

Alternatively, perhaps the boulder can be pushed north from (41,12) to (41,13), but the map shows a `@` at (41,12) which is the boulder. If the agent moves to (41,12) and then pushes north, but there's a bar to the north according to the map's #####`@# structure. Maybe the boulder can't go further north. 

Looking at the map, the boulder is at (41,12). The fountain is westnorthwest, which might be at a position like (38,9) or similar, but exact coordinates are unclear from the map. The agent needs to navigate around the bars to reach the boulder and push it towards the fountain. Since moving west from (42,11) is blocked by bars, perhaps the agent should try going east briefly to find another path. But previous attempts to go east hit bars too. 

Another angle: the stairs up are far westnorthwest, but the goal is to push the boulder to the fountain. Maybe the fountain is in a different direction. The language observation says fountain very near westnorthwest, so perhaps moving west and north from the boulder's current position. If the boulder is at (41,12), moving west to (40,12) and then north to (40,11) might reach the fountain. But need to check if there are obstacles. 

The agent's current position is (42,11). To get to (41,12), move west to 41,11, then north to 41,12. From there, push the boulder west to 40,12, then north to 40,11. But the bars are a problem. Maybe the agent can find a way around the bars. Alternatively, check if the boulder can be pushed in another direction. 

The message when trying to push the boulder said ""With great effort you move the boulder."" So pushing is possible if there's no obstacle behind. The latest move where the agent pushed the boulder south was successful. Now, perhaps pushing it further south? But the map shows that moving south from (41,12) might hit a bar or a wall. 

Alternatively, check the map again. The map shows at position 6: `#######.{#`, which could be a wall with a fountain ({) at (6, ?). The boulder is at (41,12). The agent needs to get the boulder to that fountain. The distance is quite far, so maybe the agent needs to navigate around the bars to a position where they can push the boulder towards the fountain. 

Given the barriers, perhaps the best move is to continue pushing the boulder in the direction towards the fountain. Since the last successful push was south to (41,12), maybe pushing it further south to (41,13). But the map at (41,13) has `###...#`, which might be passable. Wait, the map row for y=13 is `##.###...#`, so position (41,13) is part of the `###...` which might be a floor. So pushing the boulder south from (41,12) to (41,13) could work. Let's check if there's an obstacle behind. The boulder is at (41,12), so pushing south would require checking if (41,13) is clear. The map shows a `.` at (41,13), which is floor. So that's possible. 

But the agent is currently at (42,11). To push the boulder from (41,12) south to (41,13), the agent needs to be adjacent to the boulder. The agent is at (42,11), which is one square east of (41,11). To reach (41,12), the agent needs to move west to (41,11), then north to (41,12). Once there, they can push the boulder south to (41,13). 

So the sequence would be: west to (41,11), north to (41,12), then push south to (41,13). But need to confirm if the path is clear. The language observation says bars adjacent southwest and west at (42,11), so moving west from (42,11) to (41,11) is possible if there's no bar there. The map shows `##..`. at position 3, y=11, which might mean floor. So moving west is possible. 

Once at (41,12), push south. That should move the boulder to (41,13), closer to the fountain. This seems like a viable step. Alternatively, check if pushing the boulder north from (41,12) to (41,11), but the agent is already at (42,11), so north from (41,12) would be to (41,11), which is where the agent is. Not helpful. 

Another option: move the agent to the northwest of the boulder to push it in a different direction. For example, moving west to (41,11), then north-west to (40,10), but that might not be the best path. 

Considering the current state, the best immediate action is to move the agent to the boulder's current position and push it south towards the fountain. So the actions needed are west, north, then push south. But the agent needs to execute these in order. 

First, from (42,11), move west to (41,11). Check if possible. The language observation says bars adjacent southwest and west at (42,11), but that might refer to the squares to the southwest and west. Moving west to (41,11) would be to the west, which might be a floor. The map shows `##..`. at (3,11), which is the west side, so probably a floor. So west is possible. 

Then move north to (41,12), which is where the boulder is. Once there, push south to (41,13). This should be allowed if there's no obstacle behind the boulder. The map at (41,13) is `###...#`, so a floor, so pushing is possible. 

Therefore, the next actions should be west, north, south. But the agent has to output one action at a time. So the first action is west to get to (41,11). Then north to (41,12). Then push south. 

But the user is asking for the next action based on the current observation where the agent is at (42,11). So the immediate next action is west to (41,11). Then the next would be north, then push south. Since the user is asking for the next action, the first step is west.

The goal is to push all the boulders onto the fountains. Let me check the current state.

Looking at the map, I'm at (41,11). There's a boulder adjacent north (probably at (41,10)). The fountains are near westnorthwest, which might be around (39,10) or similar. The bars are blocking paths, so I need to navigate around them.

The last action was west, moving to (41,11). Now, to push the boulder north, I need to move north into it. But wait, the message after moving south previously said ""With great effort you move the boulder,"" so maybe that boulder is at (41,12) now? Or maybe it's still where it was. Let me check the map again.

The map shows a '@' at (42,11) after some moves, but now the cursor is at (41,11). The boulder is adjacent north, so perhaps at (41,12). But the agent is at (41,11), so moving north to (41,12) would allow pushing the boulder further north if possible. However, the map shows a '.' there, which might be a floor. Wait, the map in the last observation has `##.###.@.#` in the fifth line, which might correspond to y=5. Wait, the coordinates are a bit confusing. Let me parse the map again.

The map is displayed with each line representing a row. The agent's position is (x=41, y=11). Let's assume that the first line of the map is y=1, and each subsequent line is y+1. So the agent is in the row corresponding to y=11. Looking at the map lines:

Line 9: ########## (maybe y=9)
Line 10: ########## (y=10)
Line 11: (the agent's row) ##..`.#@.# (y=11)
So the '@' is at position x=42, y=11. But the agent's cursor is at (41,11), which would be the position before the '@'. Hmm, maybe there's a discrepancy here. Wait, in the map, the '@' represents the agent. So in the current map, the agent is at (42,11), but the cursor says (41,11). That might be a typo or misunderstanding in the map parsing. Wait, the cursor says (x=41, y=11), but the map shows '@' at (42,11). That's conflicting. Maybe the map's x and y are flipped, or there's an offset.

Alternatively, perhaps the map's columns are x and rows are y. Each line is a row (y-coordinate), and each character in the line is a column (x-coordinate). So for example, the first line ( ########## ) is y=1, and each character in that line is x=1 to x=10. But the agent's position is (41,11), which would be way to the right of the map. That doesn't make sense because the map shown has only 10 columns. There's probably a scaling issue or the map is truncated. Maybe the actual game map is larger, but the displayed portion is limited.

Given that the agent is trying to move around bars and boulders, the key is to find a path to the boulder and push it towards a fountain. The previous attempts to move east, south, west, etc., resulted in either hitting bars or moving the boulder. The latest message when moving south said ""With great effort you move the boulder,"" indicating that pushing was successful there.

Now, looking at the current position (41,11), the boulder is adjacent north. So if I move north to (41,12), I can push the boulder further north if the path is clear. However, the map shows a '.' at (41,12), which is a floor, so pushing the boulder north would require that the next tile (41,13) is a valid target (like a floor or fountain). But the language observation mentions a fountain very near westnorthwest, which might be in that direction. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent should try to move the boulder towards the fountain. Since the fountain is westnorthwest, perhaps moving the boulder west or northwest. But the bars are blocking west movement. So the best bet might be to push the boulder north or northeast if possible.

Another approach: check the inventory. There's a potion of extra healing and some food, but not sure if relevant. The main task is to push boulders to fountains. The last action was west, moving to (41,11). The boulder is adjacent north. So moving north into it and then pushing further north could be the next step.

Alternatively, check if there's a clear path to push the boulder towards the fountain. If moving north is blocked by bars, maybe try to move northeast or east. But previous attempts to east resulted in hitting bars. 

Given the latest map, the agent is at (41,11) with a boulder at (41,12). The next step is to move north into the boulder and push it. So the action should be north. But need to confirm if that's possible. The message when moving south before was successful, so perhaps moving north now would work. 

Wait, but in the previous step, after moving south to (41,13), the agent tried to move west and couldn't. Then moved north back. Now, the boulder is adjacent north again. So moving north into it and pushing. The action should be north.

Let's try to figure out what to do next in this Boxoban game. The goal is to push all the boulders onto the fountains. From the current observation, I'll parse the information.

Looking at the map, the agent is at position (41,10). The map shows some bars (obstacles) and a fountain at @ in position (x=43, y=10) maybe? Wait, the map's third line from the bottom has `<.{..{@.#`, so the @ is at position (43,10) perhaps, considering the indentation. 

The previous actions have moved the boulder, but it's still not on the fountain. The last message was about moving the boulder, so maybe the boulder is now at (42,10) or nearby. The agent needs to push it towards the fountain. The fountain is westnorthwest, which according to the language observation is at westnorthwest direction.

In the current map, the agent is at (41,10). The boulder is adjacent north, which would be (41,9), but looking at the map, the third line shows `##..`.@.`# which might indicate the boulder is at (43,12) or similar. Wait, maybe the map's structure is a bit confusing. Let me check the cursor position and the map again.

The cursor is at (41,11) in some previous steps, but now it's back at (41,10). The map shows `#<.{..{@.#` on the line corresponding to y=10. The `<` is the agent's position, so x=41, y=10. The `{` and `.` might be other elements, and the `@` is the fountain. So the fountain is at (43,10) perhaps. 

The boulder is adjacent north to the agent. So if the agent is at (41,10), north would be (41,9), but in the map, the line for y=9 is `##..###@.#`, which has an @ at (43,9). Wait, maybe the boulder was pushed to (43,9) earlier. But the latest message says ""With great effort you move the boulder"" when moving south. Hmm, maybe the boulder is now at (41,12) where the agent was trying to move it down.

Alternatively, the latest map shows `##.###.@.#` on line y=12, which might have the boulder at (43,12). The fountain is at (43,10) according to the map's line y=10: `#<.{..{@.#`. So the boulder needs to be pushed from (43,12) down to (43,10) over the fountain. 

The agent is currently at (41,10). To reach the boulder at (43,12), the agent needs to move east twice to get to x=43, then south twice to y=12. But there are bars blocking the path. The bars are very near north, northnortheast, etc., which might be in the way. Alternatively, maybe there's a path around the bars.

Wait, the language observation mentions bars very near north, northnortheast, northeast, eastnortheast, east, eastsoutheast, etc. So the agent is surrounded by bars on the north and east sides. The only open path might be south or west. The agent was previously trying to move south, but got blocked by bars. 

Looking at the current map, the agent is at (41,10). To the south, the line y=11 is `##..`.#@.#`, which has a `#` indicating a bar. So moving south from (41,10) would hit a bar. Therefore, the agent can't go south. West is possible if there's a path. The line y=10 to the west (left) has `#<.{..{@.#`, which is the agent's position at `<`, then `{`, `.`, etc. So moving west from (41,10) would go to `#`, which is a bar. So west is blocked.

North is blocked by bars as well. The only direction might be east, but east is blocked by bars very near. Wait, the bars are very near northeast, eastnortheast, etc., so moving east from (41,10) would be into a bar. 

Hmm, the agent is stuck in a corner with bars blocking all directions except maybe south, but south is a bar. Wait, the cursor is at (41,10), and the map shows that to the south (y=11), the position (41,11) is `##..`.#@.#`, which has a `#` at x=41, y=11. So the agent is at (41,10), and south is blocked by a bar. 

In this case, the agent can't move south, west, or north. The only possible direction is east, but that's blocked by bars. Therefore, the agent might need to look for another way to reach the boulder. 

Wait, perhaps the boulder is elsewhere. The latest message said the boulder was moved south, so maybe it's now at (41,12) or (42,12). Let me check the map again. The line y=12 for the agent's position (41,12) shows `##..###.@.#`, so the `@` there is a boulder. Wait, no, `@` usually represents a boulder in Boxoban. So the boulder is at (43,12). The agent needs to get to that position to push it further.

But the agent is at (41,10). To reach (43,12), the agent needs to move east twice (to 43) and then north twice (to 12). However, moving east from (41,10) to (42,10) is possible if there's no bar. Looking at the map's line y=10: `#<.{..{@.#`, at x=42 it's a `.` which is a passable tile. Then x=43 is `{`, which might be a wall or another obstacle. Wait, `{` might be a crate or another object. Alternatively, the `@` at x=43, y=10 is the fountain. 

So the path east from (41,10) to (42,10) is possible (since it's a `.`), then east again to (43,10) which is the fountain. But the boulder is at (43,12). So the agent needs to move from (41,10) to (43,10), then up to (43,12) to push the boulder down onto the fountain. 

But how to get past the bars. The bars are very near northeast, eastnortheast, etc., so when moving east from (41,10) to (42,10), that's allowed (as it's a `.`). Then from (42,10) to (43,10), the `@` is the fountain, which is a target. But the boulder is at (43,12). So the agent needs to go to (43,12) and push the boulder south onto the fountain at (43,10). 

To get to (43,12), the agent can move east twice from (41,10) to (43,10), then north twice to (43,12). However, moving north from (43,10) to (43,11) might be blocked by bars. Looking at the map's line y=11: `##..`.#@.#`, at x=43 it's a `#`, which is a bar. So that path is blocked. 

Alternative route: From (43,10), move north to (43,9), which on the map's line y=9 is `##..###@.#`, with an `@` at x=43, y=9. That's another boulder. Wait, maybe there are multiple boulders. The agent needs to push both onto fountains. 

But the primary goal is to get the boulder at (43,12) onto the fountain at (43,10). To do that, the agent needs to position itself to the west of the boulder and push it south. 

The agent is currently at (41,10). To reach the boulder at (43,12), it needs to move east twice to (43,10), then north twice, but north is blocked at (43,11) by a bar. So maybe go around the bars. 

Alternatively, move from (41,10) east to (42,10), then north to (42,11). The line y=11 for x=42 is `#` (bar), so that's blocked. So can't go north from (42,10). 

Another approach: The agent could move west, but that's blocked by a bar at x=40, y=10. 

Wait, maybe the agent can move east to (42,10), then east again to (43,10) (fountain), then south to (43,11), but that's blocked by a bar. Hmm. 

Alternatively, the agent could move north to (41,9), but that's blocked by a bar. 

This seems like a dead end. Maybe the agent needs to backtrack. Previously, the agent moved south, then west, etc. Perhaps the boulder needs to be pushed in a different direction. 

Looking at the latest message, the last move was pushing the boulder south, which might have placed it at (41,12). If the agent is now at (41,10), maybe moving north to (41,9) isn't possible, but moving east to (42,10) is possible. From there, maybe move north to (42,9), but that's blocked. 

Alternatively, the agent could try to move the boulder west. If the boulder is at (41,12), pushing it west would require the agent to be to the east of it. But the agent is at (41,10), so moving west isn't helpful. 

Wait, perhaps the boulder is at (43,12), and the agent needs to get to (42,12) to push it south. To get there, the agent can move east from (41,10) to (42,10), then north to (42,11) which is blocked, so that's not possible. 

This is getting complicated. Maybe the agent should try to find a path around the bars to reach the boulder. Alternatively, use the stairs up far westnorthwest to go to another level, but the problem is likely on the first level. 

Another observation: The agent has a blessed potion of extra healing and other items, but probably not needed right now. The focus is on moving the boulder to the fountain. 

Given the current position and map, the best possible action might be to move east to (42,10), then see if there's a way north or south. But from (42,10), moving north is blocked, south is to (42,11) which is a bar. So maybe east again to (43,10), then try to move north around the bars. 

At (43,10), the agent can move north to (43,9), which is a boulder (`@` on the map's line y=9). So pushing that boulder west might help, but the goal is to get the boulder at (43,12) onto the fountain. 

Alternatively, the agent could move from (43,10) north to (43,9), which is a boulder. If the agent pushes that north, but there's a bar at y=8, x=43. 

This is getting too convoluted. Maybe the agent should try to move east to (42,10), then east again to (43,10), and then try to move north around the bars to reach the boulder at (43,12). But how? 

Wait, the map's line y=12 for x=43 is `@`, so the boulder is there. To push it south onto the fountain at (43,10), the agent needs to be to the north of it. So from (43,12), the agent needs to move south. But the agent is at (43,10), so they need to go up to (43,12). 

To get to (43,12), the agent can move east from (41,10) to (42,10), then east to (43,10), then north twice, but north from (43,10) to (43,11) is blocked by a bar. So maybe move north to (43,9) which is a boulder, then push it north? But that might not help. 

Alternatively, the agent could move from (43,10) west to (42,10), then north to (42,11) which is blocked. 

Hmm. Maybe the agent needs to find a different approach. Since the boulder was last moved south, it's now at (41,12) perhaps. The agent is at (41,10). To reach (41,12), the agent needs to move north twice, but north is blocked by bars. So that's not possible. 

Wait, the agent is at (41,10). Moving north would take them to (41,9), which on the map is `##..` indicating bars. So that's blocked. 

In this scenario, the agent might be stuck and need to find another way. Perhaps the solution is to move east to (42,10), then east to (43,10), then try to move north around the bars to reach the boulder at (43,12). However, the path is blocked. 

Alternatively, the agent could use the stairs up at westnorthwest to go to another level, but the problem likely expects solving it on the first level. 

Given the current constraints, the best action might be to move east to (42,10) to explore further. From there, check if there's a path.

Let's see where I am in this Boxoban-like game. My goal is to push the boulders onto the fountains. The map shows a grid with various features like bars, dark areas, stairs, and fountains. I need to navigate and push the boulders correctly.

Looking at the current position (x=42, y=10), the map shows a boulder at (41,10) since the character is at 42. The player is facing east, and there's an '@' symbol indicating their position. The map's southern parts have several barriers (bars) and a fountain in the westnorthwest direction. The stairs up are far westnorthwest, so maybe the exit is there, but first, I need to push the boulders to the fountains.

The nearby boulders are at westsouthwest and southsouthwest. The key fountain is near westnorthwest. The latest observation shows a boulder adjacent to north (probably at (42,9) if moving north from 10). Wait, the user's previous actions led to moving around, and there's a boulder that was moved before. 

Current status: The player is at (42,10), and the last action was moving east. The map shows a boulder at (41,10) (the '@' is at 42,10, and the '#' might represent the boulder). The goal is to push the boulder at (41,10) further north or towards the fountain. But looking at the map, the path north might be blocked by bars. Alternatively, maybe moving west to get a better angle to push the boulder towards the fountain.

The fountain is in the westnorthwest direction, so perhaps pushing the boulder west or north-west would work. The player needs to check if there's a clear path. From the current position (42,10), moving west would take them to (41,10), where the boulder is. If they move west, they can then try to push the boulder north or north-west.

Alternatively, moving north from (42,10) to (42,9) might clear the way. But the map shows that moving north might hit bars. The language observation mentions bars very near north, so moving north directly might be blocked. Therefore, the best approach is to move west to the boulder's location and then push it north towards the fountain. 

So the sequence would be: move west to (41,10), then push the boulder north to (41,9), and continue pushing towards the fountain. But the last message indicated that moving the boulder was successful before, so perhaps there's a path now. Need to confirm the map layout. The map shows at (42,10) there's a '#' which could be a wall or a barrier. Wait, the '@' is the player, and the '#' might be a wall. So pushing the boulder from (41,10) north towards (41,9) might be possible if there's no wall there.

Looking at the map again: The fifth line from the top (y=5) has `##.###..#`, which might indicate walls. The player is at y=10. The map's tenth line (bottom) is all walls. So, between the player's position and the fountain, there's a path. The key is to get the boulder to the fountain at westnorthwest. 

The current action should be to move west to the boulder's position and then push it north. Since the player is at (42,10), moving west to (41,10) where the boulder is. Once there, pushing north would move it to (41,9), which should be clear if there are no obstacles. The previous moves had the boulder being pushed, so this path seems viable. 

Alternatively, if moving west isn't possible due to a barrier, check other directions. But the language observation mentions bars adjacent to northeast, east, and southeast, so west might be clear. Therefore, the next action should be to move west to the boulder and then push it north.

Let's see. The agent is in a Boxoban-like environment, trying to push boulders onto fountains. The goal is to navigate and move the boulders to their target positions.

Looking at the current observation, the agent is at position (41, 10). The map shows several boulders and fountains. There's a boulder very near northnortheast and another adjacent northeast. The fountains are near southsoutheast and westnorthwest. The bars and dark areas seem to be walls or obstacles.

The agent just moved west to (41,10) after some back-and-forth movement. The last message was moving the boulder, so perhaps the agent already pushed one. Now, looking at the map, the agent is facing some bars and needs to find a path to the boulders.

The immediate area has a boulder at (41,10), but it's adjacent. The agent needs to push it. The current position is (41,10), and the boulder might be to the north or east. Since the agent was moving north and south previously, maybe the boulder is north. Let's check the map:

The map shows `#<.{..{@.#` at row 3 (assuming y=11 is the third row from top). Wait, the agent is at (41,10), which might correspond to a specific cell in the map. The map rows are a bit unclear, but perhaps the '@' symbol represents the agent. In the map, the agent is at a position with a '.' or '@' indicating their location. The boulders are marked with '{}' perhaps? Looking at the last map view:

Row 3: `##..`.#@.#` — here the '@' is at position (41,11) maybe? Or perhaps the coordinates are different. This part is a bit confusing. Let me try to parse the map again.

The map in the latest observation has several lines. Each line represents a row. The agent's position (41,10) would correspond to a specific cell in these rows. Let's assume that each row in the map is a horizontal line. For example, the first line is the top of the map, and the tenth line is where the agent is.

Looking at the map provided:

Assuming each row is a horizontal slice. The agent's position is (41,10), which would be the tenth row (since indexing starts at 0 or 1?). If the tenth row is the last one shown, which is ""##########"", then the agent might be near the bottom. But this is unclear. Alternatively, maybe the y-coordinate increases downward, so y=10 is lower on the map.

In any case, the agent needs to push a boulder onto a fountain. The fountains are near southsoutheast and westnorthwest. The boulders are near south and west. The agent is at (41,10), and there's a boulder very near northnortheast. So perhaps the agent needs to move northeast to reach that boulder.

But the bars and dark areas are obstacles. The agent needs to navigate around them. The last few moves were north, south, west, etc., trying to position themselves. Now, the agent is at (41,10), and the boulder is northnortheast. The agent should probably move east or north to get to the boulder.

Wait, in the previous steps, the agent moved west to (41,10) after being at (42,10). The boulder adjacent northeast might be at (42,9) or similar. The agent needs to check if they can push the boulder north or east.

But the message after moving west didn't mention moving a boulder, so maybe the boulder is in another direction. Looking at the language observation, there's a boulder very near northnortheast. So from (41,10), moving northeast would lead to that boulder.

The agent's inventory has healing potions and other items, but no tools needed for moving boulders. The agent just needs to push them by walking into them if there's space behind.

Given that the agent is at (41,10), and the boulder is northnortheast, the best move would be to go east to (42,10) and then north to approach the boulder. Alternatively, move north to (41,9) and then east.

But considering the map and obstacles, perhaps moving east first to get closer to the boulder. Alternatively, since the agent is at (41,10), and the boulder is northnortheast, moving northeast ( compass direction?) might not be directly possible. Maybe first move north, then east.

But the agent needs to avoid bars. The language observation says bars are very near north, northnortheast, etc. So moving north from (41,10) might hit a bar. Let me check the map again.

In the map row corresponding to y=10 (assuming the tenth row is the last one), the cells are all '#' which are walls. So the agent is near the bottom of the map, surrounded by walls. That might mean the agent is in a corridor. The boulder is northnortheast, so maybe moving east then north?

Alternatively, the agent needs to find a path to the boulder. Given the previous movements, perhaps the correct action is to move east towards the boulder, then push it north or east into a fountain.

Given the current position and the need to avoid bars, the next step could be to move east to (42,10), which was previously possible. Then from there, move north to approach the boulder. Alternatively, since the agent is at (41,10), and the boulder is northnortheast, moving northeast (combination of north and east) might be the way. But in the grid-based movement, the agent can only move in four directions: north, south, east, west.

Given the latest map, the agent is in a cell marked with '@' at position (41,10). To the northeast (41,9), there's a '.' which is an open path. To the east (42,10), there's a '`' which might be a floor or a different type of floor. The boulder is very near northnortheast, so moving east then north might lead to it.

So the next action could be east to (42,10), then north to (42,9), then push the boulder. But first, need to check if moving east is possible. The bars are very near north, northnortheast, etc., but the immediate east direction from (41,10) is to (42,10), which is a '`' as per the map's tenth row: ""##########"" — but that might be a different part. Wait, the map's rows are a bit confusing. Let me re-express the map rows:

Row 0:                                  ##########                                    
Row 1:                                  ##{..##.`#                                    
Row 2:                                  #<.{..{..#

Row 4:                                  ##..###..#                                    
Row 5:                                  ##.###...#                                    
Row 6:                                  #######`{#                                    
Row 7:                                  #######`.#                                    
Row 8:                                  #######..#                                    
Row 9:                                  ##########  

Assuming that each row corresponds to increasing y-coordinate. So the agent's current position (41,10) is in row 9 (since y=10), which is ""##########"" — all walls. That can't be right. Maybe the y-coordinate is inverted. Alternatively, the agent's position is in row 3, which has the '@' symbol. Let me check row 3: ""##..`.#.@#"". The '@' is at the seventh character (0-based index 6), so position (6,3) if each character is a cell. But the coordinates given are (41,10), which suggests a larger grid. This part is a bit confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the map is represented with each character as a cell, and the agent's position (41,10) corresponds to the 41st column and 10th row. But given the map's width, it's possible that each row has around 20 characters, which doesn't align with x=41. This suggests that the map representation might be abstract or symbolic, and the coordinates are not directly corresponding to the map's grid.

Given the confusion in mapping the coordinates to the grid, perhaps the best approach is to focus on the immediate surroundings based on the language observations and messages.

The agent needs to push boulders onto fountains. The fountains are near southsoutheast and westnorthwest. The boulders are near south and west. The agent is at (41,10), and there's a boulder very near northnortheast. The agent should move towards that boulder.

The last action was west to (41,10). The next logical step is to move east to get back into the main path. From (41,10), moving east to (42,10) is possible if there's no barrier. The language observation mentions bars very near north, northnortheast, etc., but the immediate east direction might be clear.

Looking at the map's row for y=10 (if that's the tenth row), it's all walls (##########), so moving east from (41,10) might not be possible. That suggests that the agent is at the edge of a wall, so the correct direction might be north or south.

Alternatively, since the agent was previously moving north and south, perhaps the boulder is in the northern part. The agent should try to move north from (41,10) to (41,9). But the map's row 9 (if y=9) is ""##########"", which is walls. This is confusing.

Given the uncertainty in mapping the coordinates to the grid, perhaps the best approach is to look for the nearest boulder and try to push it towards a fountain. The nearest boulder is northnortheast, so the agent should move in that direction.

Considering the agent's current position and the need to avoid bars, moving east and then north might be the way. But given the map's wall at y=10, the agent might need to move south first to a different row where there's a path.

Alternatively, the agent could move north to y=9, but that row is all walls. So maybe the agent is trapped? That can't be right. Perhaps there's a mistake in interpreting the map.

Wait, the agent's position is (41,10), and the cursor shows that. The map's rows are likely horizontal, with each row representing a y-coordinate. The tenth row (if starting from 0) would be the bottom row. If that row is all walls, the agent must be somewhere inside the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the coordinates are swapped. Maybe x is the row and y is the column. This would complicate things further.

Given the time constraints and the need to provide an action, the safest bet is to continue moving in a direction that was previously successful, like north or east, while avoiding bars.

Alternatively, since the agent last pushed a boulder to the south, maybe there's another boulder to push. The language observation mentions a boulder very near northnortheast. So moving northeast (east then north) could reach that boulder.

Given the agent's current position at (41,10), moving east to (42,10) and then north to (42,9) might be the way. If that's possible without hitting bars, then pushing the boulder from there.

Considering all this, the next action is to move east to (42,10), which was previously accessible, and then proceed north to reach the boulder.

The agent is trying to solve this Boxoban level. The goal is to push all the boulders onto the fountains. Let's look at the current state.

The player is at (42, 10). There's a boulder adjacent to the north, as mentioned in the last map. The map shows `@` at (42,10), and the boulder is probably nearby. The cursor is on the player. The fountains are located in the northwest, specifically at westnorthwest. 

Looking at the latest observation, there's a boulder very near the northnortheast and south. Also, bars are adjacent to northeast, east, and southeast. The player tried moving west before but couldn't because of bars. 

The player needs to move the boulder onto the fountain. Since the boulder is adjacent north, the agent should move north to push it. But wait, the last action was east, and the player is now at (42,10). The map shows `@` at (42,10) with a boulder possibly to the north. 

In the previous steps, the agent pushed a boulder south multiple times. Now, after moving back and forth, the boulder might be near here. The goal is to get it to the fountain in the northwest. The stairs are up far westnorthwest, but the fountain is there too. 

So, the best move would be to move north towards the boulder and push it towards the fountain. Since the agent's last action was east, and the boulder is north, moving north would allow pushing it. The player can't move into bars, so need to ensure there's space behind the boulder. 

Looking at the map, the cell to the north of (42,10) is `#` which is a wall (bar)? Wait, the map shows `##..`. Maybe the boulder is in the cell north of the player. So, the player should move north to push the boulder. The message when moving south previously said ""With great effort..."" so pushing is possible. 

Therefore, the next action should be north to approach the boulder and push it towards the fountain. Alternatively, check if moving west again is possible, but the bars are adjacent west and northwest. So, moving north is the way to go.

The agent is stuck trying to move a boulder in Boxoban. Let's analyze the current situation based on the observations and previous actions.

Looking at the map, the agent's position is (42,10). The boulder is adjacent to the north, as indicated by the message when trying to move it. The goal is to push the boulder onto a fountain. The fountain is very near the west, so probably in the westnorthwest direction based on earlier observations.

The agent has tried moving north, south, east, and west multiple times, but the most recent attempts to move the boulder failed because it's adjacent to another obstacle. The message ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" suggests that there's something blocking the boulder's path when pushing it north. 

The agent needs to find a way to position itself so that it can push the boulder north towards the fountain. Since the boulder is adjacent to the agent's north, moving north directly isn't working because the boulder can't be pushed further north unless the path is clear. 

Looking at the map, the agent is at (42,10). The boulder is north of them. To push the boulder north, the agent needs to be directly north of the boulder. However, the current position has the boulder at (42,9) if the agent is at (42,10). Wait, actually, in the map, the boulder's position might be different. The map shows `@` at (41,10) initially, but after moving, it's at (42,13) and other positions. Wait, the current map shows the agent at (42,10) with a `@`, and the boulder near north. Let me check the latest map:

In the latest map, the agent is at (42,10), and the boulder is adjacent north. So the boulder is likely at (42,9). But the map shows the agent's position with `@`, and the boulder might be marked with `#` or `O`. Wait, in the current map provided, the line for y=10 has `#<.{..{@.#` — the `@` is at position (42,10), and the boulder might be one tile north at (42,9), but in the map, the line for y=9 isn't shown. Hmm, perhaps the boulder is in a different location. Alternatively, the boulder could be to the north of the agent's current position, blocked by bars or another obstacle.

The message says the agent tried to move the boulder but in vain, implying that the path is blocked. So the boulder can't be pushed further north because there's a wall or another obstacle there. The agent needs to find a way to move the boulder to the westnorthwest direction where the fountain is. 

Since the agent is currently at (42,10), perhaps moving west or north-west could help. But the bars are in various directions, so the agent needs to navigate around them. The stairs are up far westnorthwest, but the goal is to push the boulder to the fountain, which is very near west. 

Looking at the language observation, the fountain is adjacent northwest. So the northwest direction from the agent's current position (42,10) would be (41,9). If the boulder can be moved to (41,9), that's where the fountain is. But how to get there?

The agent needs to position itself to the west of the boulder so they can push it north towards the fountain. Currently, the agent is east of the boulder. So moving west once would place them next to the boulder, allowing a push north. But in the previous steps, moving west from (42,10) would take the agent to (41,10), which might have bars or other obstacles.

Looking at the cursor's position and the map, the agent is at (42,10), and the map line for y=10 is `##..`.`.#` — the `@` is at position (42,10). To the west (41,10), there's a `#`, indicating a bar. So the agent can't move west directly because there's a bar. That explains why moving west earlier failed with the message about bars.

So the agent is blocked from moving west. They need to find another path. Since the boulder is to the north, perhaps moving north again, but earlier attempts failed. Wait, the latest message says ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" when trying to move north. That suggests that pushing the boulder north isn't possible because the path is blocked. Maybe there's a bar or another boulder north of the current boulder's position.

The agent's inventory has various items, but none that would help in moving obstacles. They need to navigate around the bars. Let's see the language observation again: bars are very near north, northnortheast, northeast, etc. So the agent is surrounded by bars to the north, northeast, etc. The only open path might be south or east, but south leads back to previous positions where the boulder was.

Alternatively, the agent could try to move the boulder in a different direction. Since the fountain is to the northwest, maybe pushing the boulder west first, then north. But the agent is blocked west by bars. 

Wait, the agent is at (42,10). To the north is the boulder. To the west is a bar at (41,10). To the east is open (since the agent moved east earlier). So maybe the agent should move east to get around the bar, then position themselves to the north of the boulder.

But moving east from (42,10) to (43,10) might be possible if there's no obstacle. Looking at the map line for y=10: `##..`.`.#` — the `.` at position (43,10) (assuming each character is a tile). So moving east to (43,10) is possible. Once there, the agent could move north to (43,9), then west to (42,9), positioning them north of the boulder. Then they could push the boulder west towards the fountain.

But this requires navigating around the bars. Let's outline the steps:

1. Move east from (42,10) to (43,10) — possible since the map shows a `.` there.
2. Move north from (43,10) to (43,9) — check if there's a bar or obstacle. The map for y=9 isn't fully shown, but previous observations mention bars far westsouthwest, etc. Assuming it's clear.
3. Move west from (43,9) to (42,9) — now north of the boulder (which is at (42,10) initially, but after moving, the boulder's position might change).
4. Push the boulder north from (42,9) to (42,8), but need to check if the path is clear to the fountain.

However, the boulder's current position is adjacent north to the agent, so if the agent moves east and repositions, they might be able to push it west towards the fountain.

Alternatively, since the fountain is to the northwest, pushing the boulder west first might be better. But the agent is blocked west by bars. So the alternative path is east, then north, then west, then push north.

This seems complicated, but the immediate action the agent can take is to move east to get around the blocking bar and then reposition to push the boulder towards the fountain.

36,Failed to obtain a valid action from the reasoning.,"<reasoning>
Let's see where I am. I'm in Boxoban trying to push boulders onto fountains. The agent is at position (42,10). There was a boulder nearby that I tried to push north earlier, but it didn't work. The message says ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" So maybe there's something blocking the boulder's path.

Looking at the map, the agent is near some bars. The language observation mentions bars very near north, northnortheast, etc. Maybe there are walls or obstacles there. The boulder is adjacent north, so perhaps the path is blocked by a bar or another object. 

The goal is to push the boulder onto the fountain. The fountain is adjacent northwest according to previous observations. So maybe I need to position the boulder so that it can be pushed towards that fountain. 

Since the boulder is north of the agent, perhaps I need to move around to the side and try pushing it in a different direction. But the bars are in the way. The bars adjacent northeast, east, and southeast could be blocking movement. 

Wait, the cursor is at (42,10), and the boulder is adjacent north. So the boulder is at (42,9). The fountain is adjacent northwest, which would be (41,9). So if I can get the boulder from (42,9) to (41,9), then it's on the fountain. But the path might be blocked by bars. 

Looking at the map, there's a `#` at certain positions. The map shows a grid with walls. The bars are likely part of the maze structure. To push the boulder west from (42,9) to (41,9), there must be a clear path. If there's a bar or another object there, I can't push it. 

From the map, the agent's position is on a '.' which is a floor. The boulder is at (42,9) as indicated by `@` in the map when the agent was there. Wait, looking back at the map after moving north, the agent was at (42,10) with `@`, and the boulder was north at (42,9) with `#`? No, the map shows the agent's position with `@` and other elements. 

Wait, the map in the latest observation shows at position (42,10) the character is '@', and the boulder is adjacent north, so probably at (42,9). The map line for y=9 would have the boulder. Let me check the map again. 

The map provided has multiple lines, each representing a row. The agent's position is (x=42, y=10), so in the map, the row y=10 would be the 10th line from the top. Looking at the map:

Line for y=10: ##.###...#

So the agent is at x=42, which is the 8th character in this line (counting from 0 or 1?), but maybe the indexing is off. Regardless, the boulder is north at (42,9), which would be in the y=9 line. The line for y=9 is ##.###..@# — so the '@' is at x=42, y=9, which is the boulder's position. Wait, no: the agent's position is (42,10), so the boulder adjacent north would be at (42,9). The map's y=9 line is ##.###..@#, which has an '@' at x=6 (if counting from 0). That might not match. Maybe the map's coordinates are different. 

This is getting a bit confusing. Let's focus on the observations. The boulder is adjacent north, so trying to push it north would be the direction to the fountain. But the message says it's impossible. So there's an obstacle in the way. Maybe a bar or another boulder. 

Looking at the language observations, there are bars adjacent southwest and northwest. The boulder is at (42,9), and the fountain is at (41,9). So pushing west from (42,9) to (41,9) would require that path to be clear. If there's a bar at (41,9), then the boulder can't be pushed there. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to move around to the side of the boulder and push it in a different direction. For example, if the agent moves west to (41,10) and then tries to push the boulder south or west. 

But the bars are very near north, northnortheast, etc., so moving west might be blocked by bars. The agent's current position is (42,10). If they move west to (41,10), is that possible? The map's y=10 line is ##.###...#, which at x=41 would be the 5th character (assuming index starts at 0). The characters are '#', '#', '.', '#', '#', '.', '.', '#', '#', '#'. So x=41 is the 5th character (0-based index 5?), which is a '#', meaning a wall. So the agent can't move west into a wall. 

Therefore, moving west is blocked. The agent needs to find another way. Let's check other directions. The bars adjacent are northeast, east, and southeast. So moving east might be possible if there's a path. The agent is at (42,10). Moving east to (43,10): looking at the y=10 line, the characters are up to '...#', so x=43 would be beyond the map's displayed area, which might be a wall or out of bounds. 

Alternatively, the agent could try to move north again, but the boulder is there and can't be moved. Maybe the agent needs to reposition themselves to the side of the boulder. For example, move south to (42,11) and then try pushing the boulder west. But the map's y=11 line is ##..`.#@.#, so at x=42, that's the 7th character (index 6?), which is a '@' (the agent's previous position). Wait, no, the agent's current position is (42,10). Moving south to (42,11) would be into the y=11 line's x=42 position. The y=11 line is ##..`.#@.#, which has characters: '#', '#', '.', '.', '`', '.', '#', '@', '.', '#'. So x=42 would be the 7th character (index 6), which is a '#', a wall. So the agent can't move south into a wall. 

Hmm. This is tricky. The agent is surrounded by walls and bars. The boulder is north, but can't be moved. The fountain is northwest of the boulder. The agent needs to find a way to push the boulder west towards the fountain. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to move north past the boulder and then find a way to pivot it. But the boulder is stuck. Another approach: check if there's a way to move the boulder by pushing it south or east, but the goal is to get it to the fountain which is northwest. 

Wait, the fountain is adjacent northwest, which is west and north. So maybe pushing the boulder west first, then north? But the boulder is already north of the agent. 

Alternatively, perhaps the agent should move northwest around the boulder. But the agent's position is (42,10), and moving northwest would be to (41,9), which is the fountain's position. But the boulder is at (42,9), so if the agent moves to (41,9), they would be next to the boulder. Then they could try pushing it west into the fountain. 

But can the agent move to (41,9)? Let's check the map. The y=9 line is ##.###..@#. The characters are: index 0: '#', 1: '#', 2: '.', 3: '#', 4: '#', 5: '.', 6: '.', 7: '@', 8: '#', 9: '#'. So x=41 (assuming 0-based) would be index 40, which is beyond the displayed map. Wait, maybe the map's x ranges from 0 to 9, given the ########## but that doesn't make sense. Maybe the map is wider. This part is unclear. 

Alternatively, perhaps the agent should try to move north again and see if there's a different path. But previous attempts to push the boulder north resulted in failure. 

Another idea: since the boulder can't be pushed north, maybe the agent should move around to the east or west side of the boulder and push it in a different direction. For example, move east to (43,10) if possible, then push the boulder south or west. But checking the map, moving east from (42,10) would be into x=43, y=10. The y=10 line is ##.###...#, so x=43 is beyond the displayed '#', which might be a wall. 

Alternatively, move west to (41,10), but that's a wall. 

This is confusing. Maybe the agent should look for another boulder or check if there are multiple boulders. The observations mention boulders near south and west. The main boulder in question is adjacent north. 

Wait, the message says ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" So the immediate boulder adjacent north is blocked. Maybe there's another boulder nearby that's blocking the path. 

Alternatively, perhaps the agent needs to use a different strategy, like using a rake or another tool, but the inventory doesn't show any such items. The inventory has darts, food, potions, etc., but nothing to manipulate boulders except pushing them. 

Given the current position and the obstacles, the best action might be to move in a direction that allows repositioning to push the boulder. Since moving north isn't working, maybe try moving east or west around the bars. But the bars are adjacent northeast, east, and southeast, so east might be blocked. 

Alternatively, move south to (42,11) if possible. The y=11 line at x=42 is '#', which is a wall. So that's not possible. 

Perhaps the agent should move northwest to (41,9), which is the fountain's position. If that's possible, then pushing the boulder from there. But need to check if that square is passable. The y=9 line at x=41 would be the 5th character (if 0-based), which is '#', a wall. So no. 

Wait, maybe the agent can move diagonally? No, the allowed actions are only north, east, south, west. 

This is quite challenging. Given the current information, the agent is stuck trying to push the boulder north because it's blocked. The best next step might be to move around to the side of the boulder and try pushing it in a different direction. Since moving west or east is blocked by walls or bars, maybe moving south temporarily and then trying another approach. 

But moving south is blocked by a wall at (42,11). So that's not an option. 

Alternative idea: Since the agent can't move the boulder north, maybe they need to find another boulder to move out of the way. The observations mention boulders near south and west. Perhaps moving one of those boulders could create a path. 

But the agent's current position is focused on the northern boulder. Maybe the priority is to get that one to the fountain. 

Alternatively, check if the agent is on the correct floor. The cursor is at (41,11) in an earlier step, but now it's (42,10). The map's layout is a bit unclear. 

Given the limited information and the fact that pushing north isn't working, maybe the agent should try pushing the boulder west. Even though the message says it's vain, perhaps there's a different blockage. Wait, the boulder is at (42,9), and pushing west would be to (41,9), which is the fountain. If that square is clear, the boulder can be pushed there. 

But the agent needs to be positioned to the east of the boulder to push it west. The agent is at (42,10), which is south of the boulder. So to push the boulder west, the agent needs to be to the east of it. Currently, the agent is south, so they can't push west. 

Therefore, the agent needs to move north to be beside the boulder. But earlier attempts to push north resulted in the message about vain effort, implying something is blocking. 

Wait, the boulder is at (42,9), and the agent is at (42,10). The agent is south of the boulder. To push the boulder north into the fountain at (41,9), the agent needs to be north of the boulder. But the agent is already north of the boulder? No, the boulder is north of the agent. Wait, the agent is at (42,10), and the boulder is adjacent north, so at (42,9). So the agent is south of the boulder. To push the boulder north into (41,9), the agent needs to be north of the boulder. So the agent needs to move north to (42,9), where the boulder is. 

But can the agent move north into the boulder? No, because you can't walk into a boulder. The agent would have to push it. But the previous attempt to move north resulted in the message about vain effort, meaning the boulder can't be moved north because it's blocked. 

So the path from (42,9) north to (41,9) must be blocked. Therefore, the boulder can't be moved north into the fountain. The agent needs to find another way to get the boulder to the fountain. 

Alternative approach: Maybe the boulder needs to be pushed east first, then north. But the goal is northwest, so that might not help. 

Alternatively, check if there's a different fountain. The observations mention fountains near westnorthwest and southsoutheast. The main target is probably the one at westnorthwest. 

Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, perhaps the best action is to try a different direction. Since moving north isn't working, maybe move west around the bars and see if there's a way to reposition. But the agent is blocked west by a wall. 

Alternatively, move east if possible. The agent is at (42,10). Moving east to (43,10): the y=10 line is ##.###...#, so x=43 is beyond the last '#' at x=9, which is likely a wall. 

Hmm. This is really stuck. Maybe the agent needs to use a different strategy, like interacting with other objects, but the inventory doesn't have anything useful. 

Wait, the stairs up are far westnorthwest. Maybe the solution is to go upstairs, but the level is 1, and the goal is to push boulders on this level. 

Given all this, the only possible action that might help is to try pushing the boulder in a different direction, even if it seems blocked. Or maybe the agent needs to move to a different position to have a clear path. 

Since the agent is at (42,10), maybe moving north to (42,9) and trying to push the boulder west. But the agent can't walk into the boulder, so they have to be adjacent. 

Wait, the agent is at (42,10), north is (42,9) where the boulder is. To push the boulder west, the agent needs to be to the east of the boulder. So the agent needs to move to (42,9) (the boulder's position) and then push west. But the agent can't move into the boulder. 

Alternatively, the agent could move west to (41,10), but that's a wall. 

I think I'm stuck here. The only possible action left is to try pushing the boulder again in a different direction or move to a different spot. Since all previous attempts to push north haven't worked, maybe try moving east or west around the bars and see if there's a path. 

But given the current map and observations, the best bet might be to keep trying to push the boulder in a different direction, perhaps west this time. Although the agent is south of the boulder, maybe there's a way to pivot it. 

Alternatively, the agent could move north to (42,9) and then try pushing west. But how? The agent can't be on the same tile as the boulder. 

Wait, the agent is at (42,10). If they move north to (42,9), which is the boulder's position, they can't do that because they can't enter a boulder's tile. So that's impossible. 

Hmm. Maybe the agent needs to use the environment, like pushing the boulder into a corner or using items from the inventory. But the inventory doesn't have tools. 

Given the information and the actions allowed, the only viable options are the four directions. Since moving north isn't working, perhaps try moving west, but it's blocked. East is blocked by bars. South is a wall. 

Wait, the agent's current position is (42,10). South is (42,11), which is a wall. So no. East is blocked. West is a wall. North is the boulder which can't be moved. 

This seems like a dead end. Maybe the agent needs to explore other parts of the map to find a different boulder or a way to clear the path. But the problem is that the observations don't show the entire map, only a portion. 

Alternatively, the agent might need to use a potion or other item to clear obstacles, but the inventory doesn't have anything that can remove bars or boulders. 

At this point, I'm not sure what to do. The only possible action left is to try a different direction, even if it's likely to fail, but the tip says not to repeat the same action if nothing changes. The agent has already tried north, south, east, west in various combinations. 

Wait, the latest observation after moving east had a message about bars. The agent is surrounded by bars and walls. The only possible move is to push the boulder, but it's stuck. 

Maybe the solution is to move to a different position where the boulder can be pushed. For example, moving northwest around the boulder. But the agent can't get there due to walls. 

I think the only remaining action is to try pushing the boulder in a different direction, perhaps west, even though the agent is south of it. But that doesn't make sense. 

Alternatively, the agent could move north and then try pushing west from there. But the agent can't move north into the boulder. 

Wait, the agent is at (42,10), north is (42,9) with the boulder. If the agent could move north into","

I'm in Boxoban trying to push boulders onto fountains. The agent's current position is (42, 10). The last action tried was moving east, but there were bars in the way, so it failed. The message says ""You cannot pass through the bars,"" which means east is blocked by bars.

Looking at the map, the agent is facing a boulder @ at (42, 10). Moving north tried to push the boulder but failed because it's blocked. The boulder is adjacent to the agent, so maybe pushing in another direction is possible. Let me check the surroundings.

The fountains are in westnorthwest, near (41,9) maybe? The boulders are near southsouthwest and westsouthwest. The agent needs to push the boulder @ towards a fountain. The current boulder is at (42,10), and there's a fountain adjacent south. Wait, in the language observation, ""fountain adjacent south"" – so moving the boulder south might place it on the fountain.

But wait, the agent is at (42,10). If the boulder is at (42,10), then moving the agent south would push the boulder to (42,11). But is (42,11) a fountain? Let me check the observations again. The message after pushing north previously said the boulder was moved, but now it's stuck. The current fountains are near westnorthwest and southsoutheast. The agent needs to get the boulder to one of those.

The language observation mentions ""fountain very near southsoutheast and northnorthwest."" The agent's current position is (42,10). Southsoutheast direction would be (43,11) or similar. But perhaps the boulder can be pushed east or south. Wait, the bars adjacent are northeast, east, and southeast. So moving east is blocked by bars. Moving south from (42,10) would take the agent to (42,11), and if there's a path, maybe the boulder can be pushed there. But the fountain is adjacent south to the agent, so maybe pushing the boulder south into that fountain.

But the last attempt to move north resulted in the agent trying to push the boulder but failing because there's something blocking north. The map shows `@` at (42,10) with `#` to the north, perhaps. The agent needs to find a direction where they can push the boulder towards a fountain without obstacles.

Looking at the map again, the agent is at (42,10) with the boulder @. To the south, there's a `.` which might be a floor. If the agent moves south, they can push the boulder to (42,11). Then check if (42,11) is a fountain. The language observation says ""fountain very near southsoutheast and northnorthwest,"" but the exact position isn't clear. Alternatively, the fountain adjacent south to the agent's current position might be at (42,11). If that's a fountain, then pushing the boulder south there would solve the problem.

So the action should be south to push the boulder into the fountain. Let's confirm. The agent is at (42,10), boulder is here. Moving south would push the boulder to (42,11). If (42,11) is a fountain, then this action would succeed. The previous attempt to push north failed because of an obstacle, so south might be the way to go. Also, the message after pushing north said ""With great effort you move the boulder."" Wait, no, in the first interaction, moving south initially moved the boulder. But in the latest observations, moving north caused ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" So north is blocked now. Therefore, moving south to get the boulder onto the adjacent fountain seems viable.

38,north,"<reasoning>
Let's try to figure out the next move here. The agent is in a Boxoban-like game, pushing boulders onto fountains. The goal is to get all the boulders to the fountains.

Looking at the current observation, the agent is at position (42, 11). The map shows some bars and dark areas around. The key elements are the boulders and fountains. From the language observation, there's a boulder very near north and westsouthwest. There's also a fountain adjacent to the southeast and northnorthwest. 

The previous actions tried moving north, east, south, and west, but there were issues like barriers or the boulder not moving. Now, the agent is at (42, 11). The cursor is pointing at the agent, and the map shows a '@' symbol there. 

The message history shows that trying to push a boulder before resulted in ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" So maybe the boulder is blocked by something. The agent needs to check the surroundings for obstacles. 

The bars are near northnortheast, southsoutheast, and other directions. The agent's current position is near a boulder to the north. To push the boulder, the agent would need to move towards it from the west or east, ensuring there's space behind it. 

Looking at the map, the agent is at (42,11). If there's a boulder to the north (maybe at (42,10)), the agent could try moving northwest or northeast to get around. Alternatively, check if there's a clear path to push the boulder south onto the fountain. 

But the recent observation after moving south from (42,10) to (42,11) didn't show any change in the boulder's position. The language observation still mentions a boulder very near north. So the boulder is probably right above the agent. To push it, the agent needs to be adjacent and have space behind. 

If the agent moves north to (42,10), which was previously the position with the boulder, but that spot's map shows a '.' which might be a floor. Wait, in the previous map, the agent was at (42,10) with '@', and moving north took them to (42,9) which had a '.'? Not sure. Maybe need to re-examine the map snapshots.

Alternatively, since the fountain is adjacent to the southeast, maybe the agent should head that way to find another boulder. But the immediate task is to push the boulder north onto the fountain. 

Wait, the fountain is near westnorthwest, so maybe the agent should move west to get to that fountain. But the bars are blocking movement east. The agent's inventory has a potion of extra healing, but that's not useful for movement. 

The best approach seems to be to locate the boulder north of the agent and attempt to push it south towards the fountain. To do that, the agent needs to be positioned west or east of the boulder so they can push it. If the boulder is at (42,10), and the agent is at (42,11), moving west to (41,11) and then trying to push the boulder east into the fountain. 

But earlier attempts to move west resulted in being blocked by bars. The language observation says ""bars adjacent northeast, east, and southeast,"" so moving east is blocked. Moving west might be possible if there's a clear path. Wait, the cursor is at (41,11) after moving west once, but then bars were adjacent. 

Hmm, perhaps the agent needs to find a different path. Let's check the map again. The map shows a lot of '#' which are walls or bars. The agent is in a corridor with bars around. The fountains are westnorthwest, so maybe the agent should head west towards that direction. 

Alternatively, since the boulder is very near north, maybe the agent should move north to push it. But the previous attempt to move north resulted in ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain,"" implying there's something blocking it. Maybe another obstacle or another boulder. 

Looking at the language observation, there are boulders near southsouthwest and west. The agent needs to clear a path or position themselves correctly to push the boulder. 

Another angle: the agent has a potion of extra healing, but that's not relevant here. The key is to push the boulder onto the fountain. The fountain is adjacent southeast, so maybe after moving the boulder, the agent can direct it there. 

Wait, the current cursor position is (42,11). The map shows a '@' there. The boulder is very near north, so likely at (42,10). To push it south, the agent needs to be west or east of it. If the agent moves west to (41,11), then they can try to push the boulder east into the fountain at southeast. 

But moving west from (42,11) to (41,11) – is that path clear? The language observation says bars are adjacent northeast, east, and southeast, but not necessarily west. The agent previously moved west to (41,11) and saw the same observations. Maybe there's a bar blocking the way west. 

Alternatively, the agent could try moving northwest to (41,10) to get around the barrier. Let's see. If the agent moves northwest, that's a diagonal move, but the allowed actions are only north, south, east, west. So diagonal isn't possible. 

The agent needs to navigate around the bars to reach a position where they can push the boulder. Since moving east is blocked by bars, perhaps moving south to (42,12) and then west or north. 

But the agent's current position is (42,11). Moving south would take them to (42,12), which might have a clear path. Let me check the map again. The map at position (42,12) is shown as part of the ########## structure, which are probably walls. 

Alternatively, the agent could move west to (41,11) and then check if there's a way to push the boulder from there. If moving west is possible (not blocked by bars), then the agent can try pushing the boulder east. 

Given the previous attempts, moving west resulted in the same position, indicating a barrier. So maybe the agent needs to find another route. 

Another possibility: the boulder is stuck because there's another obstacle behind it. The agent needs to remove that obstacle first. But since the agent can't interact with other objects except pushing boulders, perhaps they need to find a way to rearrange the boulders. 

Alternatively, the agent might have to move to a different position to access the boulder. For example, moving north to (42,10) where the boulder is located, but that spot might be blocked. 

Wait, the map at (42,10) shows a '.' which is a floor. The boulder is very near north, so maybe it's at (42,9). The agent is at (42,11). To reach (42,9), they need to move north twice. But earlier attempts to move north resulted in being unable to push the boulder. Maybe because there's another boulder or obstacle behind it. 

Alternatively, the agent should check if there's a clear path behind the boulder to push it. If the boulder is at (42,10), pushing south into (42,11) where the agent is, but the agent is already there. That wouldn't help. 

Perhaps the correct action is to move west to (41,11) and then try to push the boulder east into the fountain. Even if moving west is blocked, maybe there's a way. But the previous observation said ""You cannot pass through the bars"" when moving east. 

This is getting a bit stuck. The agent needs to find a way to position themselves to push the boulder onto the fountain. Given the current position and the obstacles, the best bet might be to move west to try and find a clear path or alternatively move south to see if there's a different route. 

Alternatively, since the fountain is adjacent southeast, maybe the agent should move southeast towards it, but the bars are blocking that direction. 

Given the constraints, the most logical action is to attempt to push the boulder again from the current position. Even if it failed before, maybe there was a misunderstanding in the positioning. 

So, the agent should try to move north again to be adjacent to the boulder and push it south. The previous failure might have been due to an incorrect direction. Let's try that.

The agent is in a Boxoban-like environment trying to push boulders onto fountains. The goal is to navigate and push the boulders correctly.

Looking at the current map, the agent is at (42, 10). The map shows several bars and dark areas, with fountains at specific locations. There's a boulder adjacent to the north. The previous attempts to move the boulder resulted in the message ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain,"" which probably means there's an obstacle behind it or the boulder is in a position where it can't be pushed further.

The message history shows repeated attempts to move north, west, etc., but the boulder isn't moving. Maybe the boulder is stuck against another obstacle or a wall. The agent needs to check the surrounding tiles to see if there's an obstacle behind the boulder. Since the last action was north and it failed, perhaps the boulder is against a bar or a wall.

The inventory has various items, but none that directly relate to manipulating the environment except for the darts and rations, which are probably not useful here. The key is to navigate around the boulder or find a way to push it by rearranging the position.

Looking at the map again, the agent is at (42, 10) with a boulder adjacent north. If the agent moves north, they might be trying to push the boulder but can't because there's something blocking its path. Maybe there's a bar or another boulder behind it. The agent should try moving in a different direction to create space for the boulder.

Alternatively, perhaps the agent needs to move to a position where they can push the boulder in a different direction. For example, moving east or west to get around the boulder and then pushing it north. However, the previous attempts to move east resulted in ""You cannot pass through the bars,"" indicating there are bars blocking that path.

The agent's current position is (42, 10). The boulder is north of them. If they move north again, they might be trying to push it, but it's not working. Maybe the boulder is stuck against a fountain or a bar. The agent should check the tile north of the boulder to see what's there. If there's a fountain, that's the target, but if there's a bar, they can't push it further.

Since the agent can't move the boulder north, perhaps they need to move to a different spot. Trying to move west or east again might not work due to bars. The only unexplored direction could be south, but moving back south might not help. Alternatively, the agent could try to move northeast or northwest if possible, but the map layout isn't clear.

Another approach is to look for other boulders that need to be moved. The observation mentions boulders near southsouthwest and westsouthwest. Maybe the agent should focus on those instead. However, the current boulder adjacent north is likely the one needing to be pushed onto the fountain westnorthwest.

Since pushing north isn't working, the agent might need to find a way to reposition themselves. For example, moving west to a spot where they can push the boulder in a different direction. But earlier attempts to move west resulted in barriers. Alternatively, moving east might also be blocked by bars.

Given the constraints, the safest bet might be to continue trying to push the boulder in the same direction but in case the previous attempts were blocked by dynamic elements, maybe there's a temporary obstacle. However, the messages indicate that the boulder can't be moved, suggesting a permanent obstacle like a bar or wall.

In Boxoban, often the solution is to rearrange the boulders by moving them in a way that creates a path. Since the agent can't push the current boulder north, maybe they need to move another boulder out of the way or find a different path. But in the current observation, the only boulders mentioned are the one adjacent north and others in the southwest.

Given the lack of progress in moving the current boulder, the agent might need to explore other areas to manipulate the environment. However, the map's dark areas and bars limit visibility. The best immediate action is to keep trying to push the boulder in the same direction, perhaps in case the previous attempt had an error, but the message consistently says it's not working.

Alternatively, the agent could try to move to a adjacent tile to the boulder and see if pushing it from a different angle is possible. For example, moving west and then trying to push the boulder north-west. But again, bars are blocking movement east and west.

Given the current observations and limitations, the most logical action is to continue attempting to push the boulder north, even though it's failed before, perhaps due to a temporary issue. Alternatively, if that's not possible, move in a different direction to find a solution. However, based on the history, moving north was the last action, and it failed. Maybe moving south to a different position and then approaching the boulder again.

But the agent is already at (42, 10), and moving south takes them back to (42, 11), which was their previous position. Maybe they need to try moving in a perpendicular direction to create space. For instance, moving east slightly to see if there's a path around the bars.

Wait, the map shows that at (42,10), the agent is next to a boulder. The map line for y=10 has ""#<.{..{.@#"". Assuming the agent is at position (42,10), the '@' represents the agent. The boulder is adjacent north, so in the map's next line (y=9), there's a '#' which might be a wall or bar. So pushing the boulder north would require the tile north of the boulder (y=8, x=42) to be empty or a fountain. But if that tile is a bar or wall, the push fails.

Given that, the agent needs to find another boulder to push or find a way to rearrange the current one. Since the current boulder can't be moved north, maybe the agent should look for other boulders. The observation mentions boulders near southsouthwest and westsouthwest. Perhaps moving to those areas and pushing them towards their respective fountains.

But navigating to those areas might be blocked by bars and dark areas. The agent's current position is in a somewhat central area with bars surrounding. The fountains are at westnorthwest and south. The agent needs to get the boulders to those fountains.

Given the stuck boulder, the agent might need to move to a different spot to affect other parts of the map. For example, moving west to reduce the number of bars blocking the path. But previous attempts to move west resulted in ""You cannot pass through the bars.""

Alternatively, the agent could use items from the inventory to clear paths, but the available items don't seem to include tools for that. The camera and credit card probably aren't helpful here.

In summary, the immediate problem is the boulder adjacent north that can't be moved. The agent should try to find an alternative path or manipulate another boulder. However, given the current(map constraints and observed obstacles), the best next action might be to move in a different direction to see if there's a way to reposition or find a solution. But without more information on the map layout, the safest bet is to continue trying to push the boulder in the same direction, perhaps in case of a mistake in previous observations.

Let's see. The agent is in Boxoban, trying to push boulders onto fountains. The map has some boulders and fountains in specific locations. The latest observation shows that the agent is at (42,10) and there's a boulder adjacent to the north. The message says trying to move the boulder failed, probably because there's something blocking it behind.

First, I need to check the map structure. The agent's position is marked with @, and the boulders are with #. The fountains are {, I think. The bars probably represent walls or obstacles. The cursor shows the agent's location, and the map has a lot of empty space with those symbols around.

The goal is to push the boulders onto the fountains. The agent tried moving north before but couldn't move the boulder. Maybe there's another boulder or a wall blocking the path. The agent needs to find a way to position themselves to push the boulder towards a fountain.

Looking at the language observations, there's a fountain very near westnorthwest. The boulder adjacent north might be near there. If the agent moves west or northwest, maybe they can get around the blocking obstacle and push the boulder into the fountain.

The previous actions were moving north, south, east, west, but the boulder isn't moving. Perhaps the agent is stuck next to the boulder with something behind it. The agent needs to position themselves to push the boulder by moving in the direction opposite to the obstruction. For example, if the boulder is north and there's a wall behind it, the agent should move south to get behind the boulder and then push north.

Alternatively, maybe there's another boulder in the way. The agent should check nearby areas for obstacles. Since the map shows bars (walls) nearby, the agent might need to navigate around them to get a clear path to push the boulder.

Another possibility is that the agent is not directly behind the boulder. The agent needs to move closer to the boulder from the correct direction. For instance, if the boulder is to the north, the agent should move north until they are adjacent, then push it. But since the last attempt to move north failed, maybe there's a wall or another boulder there.

The inventory has items like potions and food, but those aren't directly relevant for moving boulders. The key is to use the correct movement to manipulate the boulder into the fountain.

So, the agent should try moving in a different direction, perhaps west or northwest, to get around the blocking obstacle and then push the boulder north into the fountain. Alternatively, move south to create space and then push the boulder north once there's a clear path.

Considering the map's layout, moving west might lead towards the stairs up and the fountain westnorthwest. If the agent moves west, they could be closer to the fountain and have a clearer path to push the boulder. Alternatively, moving northwest directly towards the fountain.

Given the agent's current position (42,10) and the fountain at westnorthwest, moving west would align them better. The agent should try moving west to see if they can get beside the boulder and push it towards the fountain.

Let's see. The agent needs to push boulders onto fountains. The current position is (42,10). The map shows some bars and a fountain to the westnorthwest. There's a boulder adjacent to the north. The previous attempts to move the boulder by going north failed because maybe the boulder is blocked or there's something behind it.

Looking at the map, the character is at (42,10). The fountain is westnorthwest, so probably up and to the left. The boulder is at (42,11) north of the agent. The agent tried moving north before, but it didn't work. Maybe the boulder is stuck against something else. 

The bars are blocking movement to the east. The agent should try to move around the boulder. Since the boulder is to the north, perhaps moving west or east could allow positioning to push it. Alternatively, check if there's a path to the fountain that's not blocked by bars.

Wait, the cursor is at (41,10) after moving west. The agent needs to get closer to the boulder. Maybe move west again to get next to the boulder. Then, try pushing it south into the fountain. But how to confirm the fountain's location. The language observation mentions a fountain adjacent west, which would be to the left. So moving west from (41,10) would reach the fountain. 

So the plan is: move west to (40,10), then push the boulder south into the fountain at (40,9). Need to check if the path is clear. The bars are very near north, northeast, etc., but south might be clear. Let's try moving west again.

The agent is trying to solve Boxoban, pushing boulders onto fountains. The goal is to navigate the map, find the boulders, and push them to the target positions.

Looking at the current observation, the agent is at position (40, 10). The map shows a bunch of bars and dark areas, which are probably obstacles. The relevant elements are the boulders and fountains. From the language observation, there's a boulder very near eastnortheast and westsouthwest. The fountain is near southsoutheast, west, and westnorthwest. The stairs up are near west, which might be the exit, but the priority is to push the boulders onto fountains.

The agent was previously trying to move north, east, west, etc., but hitting bars or boulders. The last action was west, moving to (40,10). Now, the cursor is here. The message indicates there might be a boulder nearby that's blocking movement. The language observation mentions a boulder very near eastnortheast and westsouthwest. So perhaps the boulder is to the east or west.

Since the agent is at (40,10), looking at the map, the character shown is '@' at (40,10), which is the agent. The map line for that position has `<.{..@..#`, so maybe the boulder is in the vicinity. The goal is to push a boulder towards the fountain. The fountain is near southsoutheast, west, and westnorthwest. So maybe the western fountains are targets.

The agent needs to locate the nearest boulder. The observation says boulders near southsoutheast, so perhaps moving southeast might lead to a boulder. Alternatively, the boulder westsouthwest could be nearby. Since the agent is at (40,10), moving west might take them towards westsouthwest, but there's a boulder there. However, trying to push it might not be possible if there's no space behind.

Alternatively, the boulder in eastnortheast might be a target. Let's see. The agent is at (40,10). If they move east, they might reach (41,10), but there's a bar adjacent to the northeast. So maybe moving east is blocked by bars. The bars are very near north, northnortheast, etc., so perhaps the agent is surrounded by obstacles except south or west.

Looking at the previous actions, the agent tried moving north multiple times but couldn't because of the boulder. The last successful move was west to (41,10), then another west to (40,10). Now, the agent is at (40,10). The message says ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain,"" which probably happened when trying to push a boulder earlier.

The current cursor is at (40,10), and the boulders are near southsoutheast and westsouthwest. The agent needs to navigate to a boulder and push it towards a fountain. The western fountain (westnorthwest) is a target. So maybe moving west again to get closer to the boulder at westsouthwest. But the agent is already at (40,10), and moving west might take them to (39,10), but the map shows `<.{..@..#` at x=40, which might imply that moving west from (40,10) is possible if there's no obstacle.

Wait, the map line for y=10 is: #<.{..@..# So at x=40, y=10, the agent is '@', and to the west (x=39) there's a '{', which could be a door or a different structure. Maybe that's passable. Alternatively, the bars are obstacles. The agent needs to check if they can move west towards the boulder at westsouthwest.

Alternatively, the boulder at eastnortheast might be closer. But the agent is at (40,10), and eastnortheast would be towards higher x and y. Maybe moving east is blocked by bars. The language observation says bars are adjacent northeast, east, and southeast, so moving east from (40,10) would hit a bar.

So the best option might be to move south towards the southern fountains. The fountain is near southsoutheast, so moving southeast might lead to that area. Alternatively, the agent could try to find a path around the bars to reach a boulder.

Another approach is to check the inventory. The agent has a potion of extra healing and some food, but nothing that affects movement or pushing. The key is to push the boulder. Since the previous attempt to push failed, maybe the boulder is blocked in place. The agent needs to find an unobstructed path to push it.

Looking at the map, the agent is at (40,10). To the south, there's a path possibly. The map shows `##..`.#..#` for y=11, which might be passable. Moving south to y=11 could be a way to reposition. Then, from there, try to move west or east towards a boulder.

Alternatively, the agent could try to move north again, but the boulder is blocking. The message said ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain,"" which happened when the agent tried to push north. So perhaps the boulder is north of the agent, and moving north isn't possible.

In the current position, the agent might need to move south to y=11, then check the surroundings. The language observation mentions a boulder very near eastnortheast and westsouthwest. If the agent moves south, they might be able to approach the westsouthwest boulder from the east, pushing it towards the westnorthwest fountain.

So the planned action is to move south to y=11, then from there, attempt to move west or east towards the boulder. But first, moving south is a safe repositioning.

Another possibility is that the boulder at westsouthwest is at (38,10) or similar. The agent is at (40,10), so moving west to (39,10) might reach the '{' character, which could be a door. If that's open, the agent can move through. Then, continue west to reach the boulder.

Alternatively, the agent could try to move northeast, but the bars are adjacent there. So probably not.

Given the current position and the need to push a boulder to a fountain, the best immediate action is to move south to y=11, giving the agent a better view of the terrain and access to push the boulder in that direction.

Let's see. I need to figure out how to push the boulders onto the fountains in Boxoban. The player is at (40, 10) and there's a boulder near eastnortheast and westsouthwest. The fountains are southsoutheast, west, and westnorthwest.

First, the agent tried moving around the bars and boulders. They moved north, west, etc., but hit bars or boulders. The last message says they can't pass through bars again, so they're stuck between bars and maybe a boulder.

Looking at the map, the boulder is at (40, 10) maybe? Or adjacent. The cursor is at (40,10), and the boulder is very near eastnortheast and westsouthwest. So maybe the boulder is to the east or west. To push a boulder, the player needs to move into it from behind, and there must be space in front.

The agent tried north, east, south, west, but some directions are blocked by bars. The fountains are in southsoutheast and westnorthwest. The agent needs to position a boulder onto one of those.

Looking at the recent moves, the agent is moving west and south but hitting bars. Maybe the boulders are to the east or south. The agent is at (40,10). If there's a boulder to the east, pushing it west might get it to the westnorthwest fountain. Or if there's a boulder to the south, pushing it north towards the southsoutheast fountain.

But the latest observation says the boulder is very near eastnortheast and westsouthwest. So maybe one boulder is east of the agent and another is westsouthwest. If the agent is at (40,10), east would be (41,10). The east direction was previously blocked by bars, so maybe the boulder is there. To push it, the agent needs to come from the west (current position) and move east into the boulder, but if there's a bar to the east, that's not possible. Alternatively, the boulder might be in a different direction.

Alternatively, perhaps the agent should try moving south to see if there's a path. The last move was south, but the message was about bars. Maybe the agent needs to reorient. Let's check the map again. The map shows a lot of ### which are probably walls or bars. The agent is somewhere in the grid with various obstacles.

Another approach: Since the agent is stuck between bars and boulders, maybe they need to find a way to move around to a position where they can push a boulder towards a fountain. The fountains are southsoutheast and westnorthwest. If the agent can get to a spot adjacent to a boulder and there's space in front, they can push it.

Given that the agent is at (40,10), and the boulders are near eastnortheast and westsouthwest, perhaps moving westsouthwest isn't possible due to bars. Maybe the best bet is to check if there's a clear path to push a boulder east or south. But the recent attempts to move east resulted in ""can't pass through bars"", so maybe the path is blocked. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent should try moving north again, but they tried that and it didn't work. Wait, the last message when moving north was ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" So there's a boulder in the way when trying to move north. So the boulder is north of the agent. If the agent is at (40,10), north would be (40,9), but there's a boulder there. To push it, the agent needs to be south of the boulder and move north into it, but if there's a barrier in front of the boulder, that won't work.

Alternatively, maybe the agent should look for a fountain in the westnorthwest direction and try to push a boulder there. The stairs up are westnorthwest, so maybe that's a key location. The agent needs to get a boulder to that fountain.

Given the stuck situation, perhaps the best move is to try a different direction. The agent was moving west and north but hit bars. Maybe moving south now could reveal a new path or a boulder that can be pushed. Alternatively, check if moving east is possible now, but previous attempts said bars are blocking.

Wait, the latest observation after moving south says bars are adjacent north, south, and northwest. So moving north from (40,10) is blocked by bars. Moving south would be into more bars? Or maybe there's a path. The agent is at (40,10), and moving south would take them to (40,11). The map shows that at y=11, there's a `@` near the west. Maybe that's the agent's position after moving south. The map's y-coordinate might be inverted, so lower y is south. The map's ninth line (from the top) is y=9, and the agent is at y=10. Moving south to y=11, which might have a different layout.

Looking at the map structure, each line represents a row. The agent's position is (x=40, y=10), which would be the 10th line from the top (assuming y=1 is the first line). The line for y=10 shows `##..`. `@` is at position 3 in that line. So the agent is in a corridor with possible walls to the north and south.

Given that, maybe the agent should try to move in a direction where there's a clear path to push a boulder. Since the fountains are in southsoutheast and westnorthwest, perhaps pushing a boulder towards the westnorthwest fountain by moving west and then north. But the agent is already near westsouthwest bars.

Alternatively, check if the boulder at westsouthwest can be pushed east into the fountain. The agent is at (40,10). The westsouthwest boulder would be at (39,11) or similar. If the agent moves west to (39,10), then they can try to push the boulder east into the fountain. But need to check if there's space.

Alternatively, maybe the agent should pick up an item, but the inventory shows various items but nothing that would help push boulders. The main goal is to push boulders using movement.

Given that the agent is stuck between bars and boulders, perhaps the best action is to try a different direction that wasn't blocked before. For example, moving east again, but if bars are there, it's not possible. Alternatively, check if moving southwest or southeast could lead somewhere. But the language observations mention dark areas in those directions.

Alternatively, since the agent has a potion of extra healing, maybe using it isn't necessary right now. The priority is to push boulders. 

Another idea: The agent might need to reposition to get behind a boulder. For example, if there's a boulder to the north, moving north into it would push it if there's space south of it. But previous attempts said ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" So maybe the space in front of the boulder is blocked.

Given the current state, perhaps the agent should try moving south again to see if there's a different layout there. The last move south had a message about bars, but maybe there's a boulder that can be pushed south into a fountain. The southsoutheast fountain is a target. If the agent can get a boulder there, that would solve the puzzle.

Alternatively, since the agent is at (40,10), moving west to (39,10) and then north or south might reveal a path. But the bars are adjacent northwest, so moving west might hit a bar.

Given all this, the safest bet is to try moving in a direction that wasn't previously blocked but could lead to pushing a boulder. Since moving east was blocked by bars, maybe moving south again, or trying to find an open space adjacent to a boulder.

Alternatively, the agent could try moving in a diagonal direction, but the allowed actions are only north, east, south, west. So no diagonals.

After considering all options, the most plausible action is to continue moving west to see if there's a boulder that can be pushed towards the westnorthwest fountain. Or maybe moving north again, but that didn't work before. Alternatively, check if moving southwest is possible.

Wait, the language observation says ""bars adjacent southwest and northwest."" So moving southwest from (40,10) would be to (39,11), which is adjacent to bars. So that's blocked.

Perhaps the best action is to move west again, towards the westsouthwest boulder, to try to push it east. If the agent moves west to (39,10), then they can try to move north or south into the boulder. If there's space east of the boulder, pushing it towards the fountain.

Let's try to figure out what to do next. The agent is in a Boxoban-like environment, trying to push boulders onto fountains. The current position is (x=39, y=10). The map shows some bars and dark areas, but the key elements are the boulders and fountains.

Looking at the observations, there's a boulder adjacent to the southwest. The fountains are very near the west and east. The agent's inventory has some items, but I don't think they're relevant right now since the goal is to move boulders.

The agent tried moving around but hit bars or boulders. The last action was west, moving to (39,10). Now, there's a boulder to the southwest. To push a boulder, the agent needs to move towards it and then in the direction where there's no obstacle behind. The boulder is adjacent southwest, so if the agent moves west again, they would be next to the boulder. Then, moving west again could potentially push the boulder if there's space behind it. But I need to check the map layout.

Looking at the map, the agent is at position 39,10. The map shows a '#' which might be a wall or barrier. The boulder is at southwest, so moving west from (39,10) would take the agent to (38,10), where the boulder is. Then, pushing it west to (37,10) would require that space to be unoccupied. The map's third line has a '<.{.@{..#' which might indicate the boulder's position. If moving the boulder west is possible, that's the way to go. Alternatively, maybe moving north or south could allow accessing other boulders, but the immediate target is the southwest boulder.

The message history shows that trying to move the boulder north resulted in failure, so the direction should be west. Let me confirm the directions. South of the agent is y=11, north is y=9. The boulder is southwest, so x decreases and y increases. Wait, in the map, the agent is at (x=39, y=10). Southwest would be x-1, y+1, so (38,11). But the boulder is adjacent southwest, so maybe it's directly to the left (west) at (38,10). The map's third line has '#<.{.@{..#', so the agent is at the '<' which is position 39,10. The boulder is at position 38,10 (the '@' symbol). So, moving west to (38,10) would be next to the boulder. Then, pushing it west to (37,10) if that space is free.

Looking at the map, the line with the boulder is '#<.{.@{..#'. After the '@' is a '{' which might be a fountain or another obstacle. So pushing the boulder west into (37,10) might be blocked by the '{'. Therefore, maybe the agent needs to move in another direction. Alternatively, check if there's another boulder nearby. The observations mention boulders near southsoutheast and eastnortheast.

Alternatively, maybe the agent should move north or south to reposition. But the immediate goal is to push the boulder onto the fountain. The fountain is very near west, so pushing the boulder towards west would be ideal. If the boulder is at (38,10) and the fountain is at westnorthwest, maybe moving the boulder northwest? But the agent's current position is (39,10). Northwest would be x-1, y-1, so (38,9). Is that path clear?

The map's fourth line is '##..`.#..#', which at y=9, x=38 might be a '.' indicating floor. So if the agent can move north to y=9, then west to x=38, then push the boulder northwest to (37,9) towards the fountain. But that requires navigating around obstacles.

Alternatively, the agent could try to move south to y=11, but the last observation showed a message about bars blocking movement south. So maybe staying at y=10 is better.

Another approach: since the boulder is adjacent southwest (west direction), moving west to stand next to it, then pushing it west. If the space behind the boulder (west of it) is free, that would work. The map shows after the '@' is a '{', which might be a fountain or a wall. If it's a fountain, then pushing the boulder there would solve the level. So if the agent can push the boulder west into the '{' which is a fountain, that's the solution.

Checking the map again: the third line is '#<.{.@{..#'. The '@' is at position x=38, y=10. The next character is '{' at x=39, y=10. Wait, no—the '<' is at x=39, y=10, then '.' at x=40, then '{' at x=41? Maybe the map's representation is a bit confusing. Alternatively, the '{' could be a fountain. If the boulder is pushed into the '{', which is a fountain, that's the goal. So the agent needs to push the boulder from (38,10) to (37,10), which would be into the '{' at (37,10). But is (37,10) a fountain?

The language observation mentions a fountain very near west, which aligns with the westnorthwest direction. The stairs up are far west, so maybe the fountain is at the west edge. If the boulder is pushed all the way west to the fountain, that's the solution.

Therefore, the agent should move west to (38,10) to be adjacent to the boulder, then push it west to (37,10), assuming that space is a fountain. The action would be 'west' to approach, then 'west' again to push. But since the agent can only output one action at a time, the first step is to move west to get next to the boulder. The previous attempts to push north failed, so focusing on the west direction now.

Let me try to figure out what to do next. The goal is to push boulders onto the fountains. From the current observation, I see there's a boulder at (40,10) which is west of the agent's current position (38,10). The agent is at (38,10), and there's a boulder to the east, near x=40. Also, there's a fountain adjacent to the west, which is where the agent is currently. So the plan would be to move towards the boulder, push it towards the fountain.

Looking at the map, the agent is at x=38, y=10. The boulder is at x=40, y=10, so east of the agent. However, moving east might be blocked by bars or other obstacles. The language observation mentions that bars are very near north, northeast, eastnortheast, eastsoutheast, southeast, southsoutheast, south, southwest, westsouthwest, northwest, and northnorthwest. Specifically, bars are adjacent to northeast, east, and southeast. So moving east directly might hit a bar. 

Wait, the cursor is at (38,10), and the boulder is at (40,10). The agent needs to go east to reach the boulder. But according to the map, there's a bar very near northeast, east, and southeast. So moving east one step might hit a bar. But the boulder is east of the agent, so perhaps the agent needs to move east to get next to the boulder and then push it west towards the fountain.

But before moving east, check if there's a clear path. The agent is at x=38, y=10. Moving east to x=39, y=10. The language observation says bars are very near eastnortheast, east, and southeast, but adjacent northeast. So at x=39, y=10, is there a bar? The adjacent northeast bar would be at x=39, y=9? Not sure. The exact map layout isn't fully visible, but the agent needs to navigate carefully. 

Alternatively, maybe the boulder is stuck against a bar, making it impossible to push. The message when trying to push earlier said ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain,"" so perhaps the boulder is blocked by a bar or another obstacle. If that's the case, the agent needs to find another way to free the boulder or move it via a different path.

Looking at the cursor position and the map, the agent is at (38,10), and the boulder is at (40,10). The fountain is adjacent to the west, which is where the agent is. So the immediate goal is to get the boulder to the fountain. Since the boulder is east, perhaps the agent needs to move around the barriers. 

But the bars are blocking the direct path. Maybe the agent should move north or south to find an alternative route. Looking at the language observations, there are dark areas near north, northeast, etc. Not sure if that's passable. The stairs up are far west, which might not be useful right now. 

Another possibility is that the boulder is adjacent to a bar, preventing it from being pushed. If that's the case, the agent might need to move the bar first, but since the agent can't interact with bars except by moving through them if possible. However, the agent's instructions are to move in the four directions, not to interact with objects directly except by pushing boulders. 

So, the next step is to try pushing the boulder by moving into it from the west. The agent is at (38,10), boulder at (40,10). To push the boulder east, the agent would need to move east into it. But if moving east is blocked by bars, that's a problem. Alternatively, maybe the agent can move north or south around the boulder and then push it towards the fountain. 

Looking at the map again, the agent is at x=38, y=10. To the east is the boulder at x=40, y=10. The fountain is to the west at x=37, y=10 (assuming adjacent west). So pushing the boulder west from x=40 to x=39, then x=38, then x=37 would get it onto the fountain. But the agent needs to be positioned to push it. 

The agent is currently at x=38, so to push the boulder west, the agent needs to move into the boulder from the east. So move east once to get to x=39, y=10, then east again to x=40, y=10 (the boulder), then push it west. But if moving east from x=38 to x=39 is blocked by a bar, that's not possible. 

The language observation says ""bars very near north, northnortheast, northeast, eastnortheast, east, eastsoutheast, southeast, southsoutheast, south, southwest, westsouthwest, northwest, and northnorthwest."" So at x=39, y=10 (east of agent), there might be a bar. Therefore, moving east directly is blocked. 

In that case, the agent might need to move north or south to go around the barrier. Let's check the map. The agent's y-coordinate is 10. Moving north to y=9 or south to y=11. The language observation mentions dark areas near north, but not sure if that's passable. 

The cursor's current position is (38,10). Moving north to (38,9). What's there? According to the map, the rows above are empty (lots of spaces), but there might be bars or other obstacles. The language observation doesn't specifically mention barriers at (38,9), but it's in a dark area. Maybe it's passable. 

If the agent moves north to y=9, then perhaps can approach the boulder from the north or south. Alternatively, moving south to y=11. Not sure. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent can move west towards the fountain, but the boulder is blocking that path. The fountain is adjacent to the west, so the agent is next to it, but the boulder is east. 

Another idea: since the boulder is at (40,10), and the fountain is at (38,10) adjacent west, maybe the agent can push the boulder west two steps: from 40 to 39 to 38. To do that, the agent needs to be at 39,10 and then 40,10. But again, moving east to 39,10 might be blocked. 

Given the barriers, perhaps the only way is to find a detour. Let's think: the agent is at (38,10). To the east is a bar (since moving east is blocked), so moving east isn't possible. What about moving north? To (38,9). If that's passable, then the agent can go north, then east around the bar, then south to reach the boulder. 

But without knowing the exact layout, it's risky. Alternatively, the agent could try moving south to (38,11), then east. But again, depends on obstacles. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent can push the boulder north or south around the barrier. Suppose the boulder is at (40,10). If the agent moves north to (38,9), then east to (39,9), then north to (39,8), but this is getting complicated. 

Alternatively, the agent could use the staircase up far west, but the stairs are at x=41, y=11 or similar? Not sure. The stairs are far westnorthwest, which might be at a different coordinate. 

Given the current information, the most straightforward approach is to attempt to move east towards the boulder, but that's blocked by bars. Therefore, the agent needs to find another path. 

Looking at the cursor position and map, maybe moving west towards the fountain isn't helpful since the boulder is east. 

Wait, the agent is at (38,10), and the fountain is adjacent west at (37,10). So the agent is next to the fountain. The boulder is at (40,10). So the goal is to get the boulder to (38,10) or (37,10). 

To do that, the agent needs to push the boulder west. To push it, the agent must be behind it. So the agent needs to move east to get next to the boulder. But movement east is blocked. 

Therefore, the agent must find a way around the barrier. Since moving east is blocked, perhaps moving north or south around the barrier. 

Assuming moving north to (38,9) is possible, then the agent can go north, then east, then south to position themselves behind the boulder. 

For example:

1. Move north to (38,9)
2. Move east to (39,9)
3. Move south to (39,10)
4. Move east to (40,10) (boulder)
5. Push west to (39,10)

But this requires that the path from (38,9) to (39,9) to (39,10) is clear. 

Alternatively, from (38,10), move north twice to (38,8), then east, etc. 

But without seeing the exact map layout, it's hard to be precise. 

Another possibility: the agent can try to move south to (38,11), then east. 

Alternatively, the agent could use the fact that there's a bar adjacent northeast, so at (39,9) or similar. 

Given the uncertainty, the safest bet might be to move north to avoid the immediate barrier and then find a path east. 

So, the next action could be north.

The agent is in Boxoban, trying to push boulders onto fountains. The current position is (x=38, y=9). The map shows some bars, dark areas, fountains, and boulders. The main goal is to push the boulders to the fountains.

Looking at the language observation, there's a boulder very near the south. The fountain is adjacent to the southwest. So maybe there's a boulder that needs to be pushed towards the southwest fountain. The agent is at (38,9), and the cursor is there. The map shows a boulder at (38,10) perhaps? Let me check the map again. The map line for y=10 has #<.{@.{..# which might indicate a boulder (@) at position x=38, y=10. But the agent is at y=9 now after moving north.

The message history shows previous attempts to move north resulted in trying to move a boulder but failing. So maybe there's a boulder in the way. The agent needs to navigate around obstacles to reach the boulder. Since the boulder is south of the agent's current position (y=9), moving south might be necessary. But there are bars and dark areas that could block the path. 

The language observation mentions bars very near eastnortheast, east, southeast, and westnorthwest. So moving east might be blocked by bars. The fountain is adjacent to the southwest, which is the direction the agent came from. But the boulder is to the south. Wait, the agent was at (38,10) before moving north to (38,9). The boulder is very near south, so moving south from (38,9) would take the agent to (38,10), where the boulder is. But earlier attempts to move north resulted in trying to move the boulder, which might mean that the agent is next to the boulder when trying to move north. 

Wait, perhaps the agent is adjacent to the boulder and trying to push it north, but the path is blocked. The message ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" suggests that there's something blocking the boulder's path. So to push the boulder, the agent needs to position themselves so that they can push it in the desired direction, ensuring there's space behind it.

Looking at the current cursor position (38,9), the map shows a boulder at (38,10). The fountain is adjacent to the southwest, which is (37,9). So the agent needs to push the boulder from (38,10) to (37,9), the fountain. To do that, the agent should move west from (38,9) to (37,9), then push the boulder west. But first, check if the path is clear. The bars are near eastnortheast, east, etc., so moving west from (38,9) to (37,9) might be possible if there are no bars there. The language observation says bars are very near east directions, not west. So moving west should be feasible.

So the plan is: move west to (37,9), then push the boulder west from (38,10) to (37,9). But the agent is currently at (38,9). So first move west to (37,9), then move south to (37,10), which is where the boulder is, and then push it west. Alternatively, since the boulder is at (38,10), the agent is at (38,9). If the agent moves south to (38,10), they are adjacent to the boulder. Then try to push it west. But need to check if there's space behind the boulder. The fountain is at (37,9), which is west of the boulder's current position (38,10). So pushing the boulder west would move it to (37,10), but that's not the fountain. The fountain is at (37,9), so the boulder needs to be pushed to (37,9). Therefore, the agent needs to push the boulder southwest? Or west twice?

Wait, maybe the coordinates are a bit confusing. Let me clarify the map layout. The agent is at (38,9). The map's y-axis increases downward. So moving north decreases y, south increases y. The boulder is at (38,10). The fountain is adjacent to the southwest, which would be (37,9). So to get the boulder to (37,9), the agent needs to push it southwest. But how? The agent can only push the boulder in one direction at a time. So first, move the agent to (37,10), then push the boulder west to (37,9). 

So the steps would be:

1. From (38,9), move west to (37,9).
2. Move south to (37,10) to be adjacent to the boulder.
3. Push the boulder west to (37,9), which is the fountain.

But need to check if there are obstacles in between. The language observation mentions bars very near eastnortheast, east, etc., so moving west shouldn't be blocked. Also, the dark areas are far south, southwest, and west, but the immediate area around (37,9) might be clear. 

Alternatively, the agent could move south to (38,10) first, then push the boulder west. But that would place the boulder at (37,10), which is not the fountain. So the correct approach is to get the boulder to (37,9). Therefore, the agent needs to move to (37,10) and push west.

So the next action should be south to get to (38,10), adjacent to the boulder, then push west. But the agent is currently at (38,9). Moving south to (38,10) would put them next to the boulder. Then the action would be to push west. However, the previous attempts to move north resulted in trying to push the boulder, which might mean that when the agent is north of the boulder, pushing it north isn't possible. 

Wait, the agent is at (38,9), the boulder is at (38,10). If the agent moves south to (38,10), they are adjacent to the boulder. Then, attempting to push west would require that the space to the west (37,10) is unoccupied and not blocked by bars. The language observation says bars are very near east directions, so (37,10) should be clear. Then pushing the boulder west to (37,10) is possible. But the fountain is at (37,9), so the boulder still needs to be moved one more step west. But to do that, the agent would have to move to (37,10), push the boulder again west to (37,9). 

Alternatively, after pushing the boulder to (37,10), the agent can move west to (37,9) and then push the boulder south or west again? Wait, perhaps the agent can push the boulder diagonally, but Boxoban usually allows pushing in four directions, not diagonally. So the agent needs to move in straight lines. 

So the sequence would be:

1. Move south from (38,9) to (38,10) (adjacent to boulder).
2. Push west from (38,10) to (37,10).
3. Move west from (37,10) to (37,9).
4. Push west from (37,10) to (37,9) (but the boulder is already at (37,10), so the agent needs to be adjacent and push again).

Wait, maybe after step 2, the boulder is at (37,10). Then the agent is at (38,10). To push it to (37,9), the agent needs to move to (37,10) and then push west. So:

2. Push west to (37,10) (agent at (38,10) pushes boulder to (37,10)).
3. Move west to (37,10) (agent is now at (37,10)).
4. Push west to (37,9) (boulder now at fountain).

That makes sense. So the agent needs to first move south to be adjacent to the boulder, then push west, then move to the new position of the boulder, and push again. 

But in the current observation, the agent is at (38,9). So the immediate action should be to move south to (38,10), then push west. However, the previous attempt to move north resulted in trying to move the boulder, which might indicate that when the agent is north of the boulder, they can't push it north. So moving south to be south of the boulder allows pushing north? Wait, no. Boxoban allows pushing in any direction as long as there's space behind. If the agent is south of the boulder (at (38,10)), pushing north would require the space north of the boulder (38,9) to be free. But the agent is already at (38,9), so pushing the boulder north would require the agent to be behind it. 

This is getting a bit confusing. Let's look at the map again. At y=9, the agent is at (38,9). The boulder is at y=10, x=38. So the agent is one unit north of the boulder. To push the boulder, the agent needs to be adjacent and push in a direction where the space behind the boulder is clear. Since the agent is north of the boulder, they can try to push it south. But the space south of the boulder (38,11) might be blocked by bars or dark areas. The language observation says bars are very near eastnortheast, east, southeast, and westnorthwest. So (38,11) is south of the boulder. Are there any bars there? The language observation doesn't mention bars in that area, so maybe it's clear. If the agent pushes the boulder south to (38,11), that's progress, but the goal is to get it to the fountain at (37,9). 

Alternatively, pushing the boulder west from its current position (38,10) to (37,10) would be better. To do that, the agent needs to be to the east of the boulder. But the agent is north of the boulder. So the agent needs to move south to (38,10), then west to (37,10), adjacent to the boulder, then push west. 

So the correct sequence is:

1. Move south to (38,10) (adjacent to boulder).
2. Move west to (37,10) (now next to boulder).
3. Push west to (37,9) (fountain).

But in the current observation, the agent is at (38,9). So the first action should be to move south to (38,10). Then, from there, move west to (37,10), then push west. However, the language observation says ""boulder adjacent north"" at the current cursor position (38,9). So the boulder is to the south, which matches. 

Therefore, the next action should be south to get adjacent to the boulder. Wait, but the agent is already at (38,9), and the boulder is at (38,10). So moving south would take the agent to (38,10), adjacent to the boulder. Then the action would be to push west. But the problem is that the previous attempt to move north resulted in trying to move the boulder, which suggests that when the agent is north of the boulder, moving north again doesn't help. 

Wait, in the previous steps, the agent was moving north and west, ending up at (38,9). The boulder is at (38,10). So the agent is north of the boulder. To push the boulder, the agent needs to be south of it. Therefore, the agent needs to move south to (38,10), then push west. 

So the correct action now is to move south to (38,10), then push west. But the current available actions are north, east, south, west. So the immediate action should be south. 

Looking at the current observation, the agent is at (38,9), and the boulder is south. So moving south to (38,10) is the next step. Once there, the agent can push west. But since the user is asking for the next action based on the current observation, which is at (38,9), the correct action is to move south towards the boulder.

",-0.001,False
47,west,"<reasoning>
I need to figure out the next move here. Let me start by looking at the current situation. The agent is in Boxoban, right? The goal is to push boulders onto fountains. Let me check the observations again.

The cursor is at (38, 10). There's a boulder adjacent to the south. The fountains are near southeast and westnorthwest. The bars are all over the place, which probably means walls or obstacles. The stairs are up far west, but maybe that's not relevant right now. 

Looking at the map, the agent is next to a boulder. The message said when moving north, they tried to push a boulder but failed. So maybe the boulder is blocked? Or there's something behind it. The agent needs to move the boulder onto a fountain. 

The fountains are at westnorthwest and southeast. The agent is at (38, 10), and the fountain is near southeast. If I can push the boulder south or southeast towards that fountain, that would be good. But the boulder is adjacent south. So if I move south, maybe I can push it?

Wait, the agent's current position is (38,10), and the boulder is adjacent south. So moving south would put the agent next to the boulder. To push the boulder, they need to move in the direction opposite to where they want to push it. For example, to push the boulder south, the agent would have to move north into it. But the agent just tried moving north and it failed, probably because the boulder is blocked.

Looking at the language observation, there's a boulder adjacent southwest. Wait, maybe I'm confused. Let me check again. The latest observation says ""boulder adjacent south"". So the boulder is to the south of the agent. 

If the agent is at (38,10), then moving south would take them to (38,11). But there's a boulder there. To push the boulder, the agent needs to move northwest or northeast? Wait, no. The direction to push is opposite. If the agent wants to push the boulder south, they need to move north into it. But the agent tried moving north earlier and it failed, maybe because there's something blocking the boulder's path beyond.

Alternatively, maybe the boulder is stuck against another obstacle. Let me look at the bars around. The bars are very near north, northeast, etc. So the area to the north might be blocked. If the boulder is south of the agent, and trying to push it south would require the path to be clear. But if there are bars or other obstacles south of the boulder, then the agent can't push it there.

Alternatively, maybe there's another boulder that needs to be moved first. The language observation mentions boulders near southsoutheast. Maybe that's the priority. But the agent is currently by a boulder to the south. 

Another thought: the fountain is near southeast. If the agent can move the boulder to the southeast, that would solve the problem. But how? The agent is at (38,10), and the boulder is south. Maybe moving west and then south? Or find a way to position the agent correctly.

Wait, the agent just moved west multiple times, ending up at (38,10). The boulder is south. If the agent moves south, they would be next to the boulder. Then, if they try to push it east or west? Wait, no. The direction to push the boulder depends on where the agent moves. For example, if the agent is at (38,10) and wants to push the boulder south to (38,11), they need to move north into the boulder. But maybe (38,11) is blocked by bars or another boulder.

Looking at the map, the line for (38,11) might have a bar or something. The map shows some symbols, but it's a bit cryptic. The map has a lot of '#' which might be walls or bars. The agent's position is marked with '<' I think. The boulder is marked with '@' perhaps. 

In any case, the immediate goal is to interact with the adjacent boulder. The agent needs to push it towards a fountain. Since the fountain is near southeast, maybe pushing the boulder east or southeast? But the agent is at (38,10), south of which is the boulder. So moving east from (38,10) would take them to (39,10), where there's a bar adjacent southwest? Not sure. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent should move west again to get a better position. But they've already moved west multiple times. The tip says not to repeat actions if nothing changes. 

Another angle: check if there are any other boulders. The language observation mentions boulders near southsoutheast. Maybe that's the one that needs to be pushed to the fountain there. But the agent is currently by a boulder to the south. Maybe they should handle that first. 

If the agent can't push the southern boulder because the path is blocked, they might need to move around it. But given the bars and other obstacles, that might not be possible. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent should move north to see if there's a way to push the boulder in another direction. But earlier attempts to move north resulted in failure, possibly because the boulder is against a wall or another obstacle. 

Wait, the message when moving north said ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" So the agent was trying to push the boulder north, but it couldn't move. That implies that the path north of the boulder is blocked. So the boulder is stuck north of where the agent is trying to push it. Therefore, maybe the agent needs to find a way to push the boulder in a different direction. 

Since the boulder is south of the agent, perhaps the agent needs to push it east or west. To push it east, the agent would move west into the boulder, and then the boulder would move east. But is there a clear path east of the boulder? The language observation says bars adjacent southwest and northwest, which might be near the boulder. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent should move east to get a better angle. But the bars adjacent northeast, east, and southeast might block that. 

This is getting a bit complicated. Let me recap:

- Agent at (38,10)
- Boulder adjacent south (at (38,11))
- Fountain near southeast
- Need to push boulder onto fountain
- Bars and obstacles around, mainly to the north, northeast, etc.

Possible actions:

1. Try to push the southern boulder south to (38,11), but path might be blocked.
2. Try to push it east or west if there's a path.
3. Move to a different position to access another boulder (like the one in southsoutheast).
4. Look for a clear path to maneuver the boulder.

Given that moving north failed, maybe the boulder is blocked to the north. So pushing it south isn't possible. What about east? If the agent moves west, then north, then east, maybe they can reposition. But the agent has already moved west multiple times. 

Alternatively, move east towards the bars and see if there's a way to navigate. But the bars are adjacent northeast, so moving east might hit a bar. 

Wait, the latest cursor position is (38,10) after moving west. The map shows at (38,10) there's a '<' which is the agent. The boulder is at (38,11), marked with '@'. The map line for (38,10) is '#<.{@.{..#', so the agent is in the middle of that line. The boulder is two positions to the south? Or maybe the '@' is directly south. 

Assuming the boulder is directly south at (38,11), then the agent is at (38,10). To push it east, the agent would need to move west into the boulder, making it move east to (39,11). But is there a clear path east of (39,11)? The language observation says bars very near eastnortheast, eastsoutheast, etc. So maybe (39,11) is blocked by a bar. 

Alternatively, push the boulder west to (37,11). To do that, the agent would move east into the boulder. But (37,11) might be blocked by bars or other obstacles. 

This is tricky. Maybe the best move is to try pushing the boulder east or west, depending on the path. If east is blocked, try west. Alternatively, move around to find a better angle. 

Alternatively, since the agent has a potion of extra healing and other items, but those might not be relevant here. The goal is to push boulders to fountains, so the inventory items probably aren't needed now. 

Another observation: the stairs up are far west. Maybe the solution involves going back upstairs, but that's level 1, so probably not necessary. 

Given the limited information, the most straightforward action is to attempt to push the adjacent boulder. Since moving north failed, perhaps moving west into the boulder to push it east. Let's try west. 

So the agent is at (38,10). Moving west would take them to (37,10). But the boulder is at (38,11). If the agent moves west, then north into the boulder, that might not work. Wait, no. To push the boulder, the agent needs to move towards it. For example, to push the boulder east, the agent should move west into it. 

So from (38,10), moving west to (37,10), then north to (37,9), then west again? Not sure. Maybe a better approach is to move directly into the boulder from the west. 

Wait, the boulder is at (38,11). The agent is at (38,10). To push the boulder east, the agent needs to be to the west of it and move east into it. So from (38,10), move west to (37,10), then east to (38,10), which is the agent's current position. That doesn't make sense. 

Alternatively, the agent should be one cell north of the boulder to push it south. But the agent is south of the boulder. So to push the boulder south, the agent would have to be north of it and move south into it. But the agent is already south of the boulder. This is confusing. 

Wait, in Sokoban-like games, you push a boulder by moving into it from the direction you want it to go. So if the boulder is at (x,y), and you want to push it east to (x+1,y), you need to move into (x+1,y) from the west. So the agent would move from (x,y) to (x+1,y), which is the boulder's current position, and then the boulder moves to (x+2,y). 

But in this case, the agent is at (38,10), and the boulder is at (38,11). To push the boulder south to (38,12), the agent would need to move into (38,11) from the north, i.e., move north from (38,10) to (38,11), which is the boulder. But the message said that moving north failed, likely because after moving north, the boulder is blocked. 

So perhaps the path south of the boulder is blocked by a bar or another obstacle. Therefore, pushing the boulder south isn't possible. 

In that case, maybe the agent should try to push the boulder east or west. To push it east, the agent needs to be west of the boulder and move east into it. The agent is currently at (38,10), west of (38,11). So if the agent moves west to (37,10), then east into (38,10) (which is the agent's current position), that doesn't help. Wait, no. To push the boulder east, the agent needs to be west of it and move east. So from (38,10), move west to (37,10), then east to (38,10), but that's where the agent is. This is getting confusing. 

Alternatively, the agent should move to the west of the boulder and then move east into it. So from (38,10), move west to (37,10), then east to (38,10) (agent's position), then north to (38,11) (the boulder). But that would just move the agent back. 

Maybe the correct approach is to move west to get next to the boulder, then try to push it east. For example:

1. Move west from (38,10) to (37,10).
2. Move north to (37,9).
3. Move east to (38,9).
4. Now, the agent is north of the boulder at (38,11). Then move south into the boulder to push it north? But that's the opposite direction. 

This isn't working. Maybe the agent should look for another boulder. The language observation mentions boulders near southsoutheast. The agent is at (38,10), so moving southeast might reach that area. But the path is blocked by bars. 

Alternatively, use the camera or other items to check the surroundings, but the actions are movement only. 

Given the constraints, the best bet is to try pushing the adjacent boulder in a feasible direction. Since pushing south is blocked, try east or west. 

If the agent moves west to (37,10), then tries to push the boulder east, but the path might be clear. Let's assume that moving east from the boulder's position (38,11) to (39,11) is possible. If there are no bars there, then pushing it east would work. 

The language observation says bars are adjacent northeast, east, and southeast. So (39,11) might be a bar. If so, can't push east. 

Alternatively, push west. From (38,11) to (37,11). Check if bars are there. The language observation mentions bars adjacent southwest and northwest. So (37,11) could be a bar. 

This is really tricky without seeing the map clearly. But based on the latest map, the agent is at (38,10), and the boulder is at (38,11). The map line for (38,10) is '#<.{@.{..#', which might mean that moving east from (38,10) leads to a '{' or another symbol. Not sure. 

Perhaps the safest action is to try moving north again, even though it failed before, maybe the state has changed. Or try moving west into the boulder to push it east. 

Wait, the agent is at (38,10), and the boulder is at (38,11). To push the boulder east, the agent needs to move into the boulder from the west. So from (38,10), move west to (37,10), then east to (38,10) (agent's position), which doesn't make sense. 

Alternatively, the agent should move north into the boulder. But that failed before. Maybe the path is indeed blocked. 

Given all this, perhaps the best action is to move west again to find a different path or to reposition. Or try moving east if possible. 

Looking at the latest language observation, bars are adjacent northeast, east, and southeast. So moving east from (38,10) might hit a bar. 

Therefore, the most viable action is to try moving north again, even though it failed before, maybe there's a new opportunity. Or move west to get a better angle. 

But the tip says to avoid repeating actions if nothing changes. The agent has been moving west multiple times. Maybe the next step is to try pushing the boulder in a different direction. 

Alternatively, since the fountain is near southeast, perhaps the agent should head there and look for a boulder to push. But the path is blocked by bars. 

In conclusion, the immediate action is to attempt to push the adjacent boulder. Since moving north didn't work, try moving west into it to push east, or east if possible. But given the barriers, the best bet is to move west and then try pushing.

Let's try to figure out what to do next. The goal is to push the boulders onto the fountains. Looking at the current map, I see a boulder at (x=38, y=10), which is to the east of my current position (x=37, y=10). There's also a boulder near eastnortheast and southsoutheast.

First, I need to check if I can push the boulder at (38,10). To do that, I should move west into its position. Wait, I'm already at (37,10), so moving west would take me to (36,10), which might not be the right direction. Let me confirm the map layout. The boulder adjacent to the cursor is at (38,10), so to push it west, I need to move into its space from the east. But I'm currently at (37,10), so moving east to (38,10) would allow me to push it west to (37,10). Wait, no—if I'm at (37,10) and move east, I'd be next to the boulder. Then I can push it west by moving into its space while keeping it in front of me. 

Looking at the language observations, there's a boulder adjacent southwest and northwest. Wait, maybe I need to check the directions again. The current cursor is at (37,10), and the boulder is at (38,10). So, to push it west, I need to move east (to 38,10) and then push west. But first, I need to move east. However, moving east might be blocked by bars or other obstacles.

Looking at the map, there's a bar very near north, northnortheast, etc. The bars are in various directions, but specifically, the adjacent bars are northeast, east, and southeast. So moving east from (37,10) to (38,10) might be possible if there's no obstacle. The boulder is there, but I can push it. Let me check the previous observations. Earlier, when trying to move north, there was a message about moving a boulder in vain, which might mean there was an obstacle behind it. But in this case, the boulder at (38,10) is adjacent, so I should try to move east to it and then push west.

Alternatively, there's another boulder near southeast. Maybe I should go towards that one first. But the immediate one to the east seems more accessible. Let me plan: move east to (38,10), then push west to (37,10). But I need to confirm if there's space behind the boulder. The language observation mentions a fountain adjacent northwest, so maybe pushing the boulder west towards the fountain at (37,10) would work. However, I need to check if the target position is a fountain. The fountain is adjacent west, so west of the current cursor (37,10) is (37,9) or (36,10)? Wait, the cursor's position is (x=37, y=10), and the fountain is adjacent west. So west would be (36,10), which is a fountain. So if I push the boulder from (38,10) to (37,10), that's east of the cursor, but the target fountain is at (36,10). Wait, maybe I'm mixing up coordinates. Let me clarify: in MiniHack, the coordinate system might have y increasing downward, so moving north decreases y, and south increases y. But the exact mapping might vary. Assuming standard coordinates where north is up (lower y), south is down (higher y), west is left (lower x), east is right (higher x).

The current position is (37,10). The boulder is at (38,10). The fountain is adjacent west, which would be (36,10). So to get the boulder onto the fountain at (36,10), I need to push it west from (38,10) to (37,10), then maybe further west to (36,10). But first, I need to move east to (38,10) and then push west twice. However, after the first push to (37,10), I can check if there's space to push further west. Alternatively, maybe there's a direct path.

Another consideration: the stairs up are near west, so moving towards the stairs might not be the priority. The immediate goal is to push boulders onto fountains. The boulder at (38,10) is adjacent, so the best action is to move east into it and push west towards the fountain at (36,10). Therefore, the sequence would be: move east, then push west. But first, check if moving east is possible. The language observation says there are bars adjacent northeast, east, and southeast. So moving east from (37,10) to (38,10) might be blocked by a bar. Wait, the bars are very near north, northnortheast, etc. The adjacent bars are northeast, east, and southeast. So moving east directly into the boulder might be possible because the boulder is a pushable object, not a bar. The bars are solid obstacles, while boulders can be pushed.

So, the correct action is to move east to (38,10) and then push west. But the user's previous attempts showed that moving north when adjacent to a boulder resulted in a failure message. So perhaps the correct approach is to first move east next to the boulder and then push west.

Therefore, the next action should be to move east.

Let's try to figure out what to do here. The agent is in a Boxoban-like game, needing to push boulders onto fountains. Previous actions led to some attempts where the agent tried to move north, east, west, etc., but hit bars or boulders. Let me check the current observation.

Looking at the map, the agent is at (38,10). The cursor shows ""Yourself a tourist"" there. The map has some symbols like `<`, `{`, `@`, `#`, which probably represent different elements. The `@` is the agent's position. There's a boulder adjacent to the agent's current position (south, maybe?), and fountains nearby in the west. The bars are surrounding areas, making movement tricky.

The message history shows that trying to push a boulder resulted in ""in vain,"" so the agent must be next to a boulder but perhaps there's an obstacle behind it. The language observations mention fountains very near west, so the goal is probably to push a boulder towards there.

Looking at the inventory, there's a potion of extra healing, food, etc., but pushing boulders doesn't require consuming items. The key is to find a boulder that can be pushed into a fountain. Since the agent is at (38,10), and there's a boulder adjacent north (from previous observations), maybe moving north to get beside the boulder and then push it south into a fountain? Wait, but earlier attempts to move north resulted in trying to push a boulder but failing. Maybe the path is blocked.

Alternatively, check the map again. The agent's position is `#<.{@.{..#`—the `@` is in the middle. To the west, there's a `{` which might be a wall or a barrier. To the east, there's a `.` which is a floor. The boulder is adjacent south, as per the language observation. So maybe the agent is facing north, and the boulder is south. If the agent moves south, they can get next to the boulder. But the message when moving north said ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain,"" which might mean that when moving north, the agent was trying to push a boulder that's north of them, but perhaps there's something blocking the way.

Wait, the cursor's position is (38,10), and the boulder is adjacent north. So the agent is at (38,10), and the boulder is at (38,9). To push the boulder, the agent needs to move into it, which would push it south to (38,8) if the space there is unblocked. But maybe (38,8) is blocked by bars or another obstacle.

Looking at the map, the line for y=8 is `#######..#` which at x=38 would be a `.` possibly. But need to check the map structure. The map's rows are from y=0 to y=19, but in the current view, it's not clear. The agent's current y is 10, and moving south would take them to y=11, which in the map is shown as `##..`.@.`#`—so at (38,11), there's a `.`. However, the boulder is adjacent north, so if the agent moves north to (38,9), they can try to push it.

Wait, previous actions had the agent moving north and getting a message about trying to push a boulder but failing. That might be because when moving north, the agent was attempting to push the boulder that's north of them, but the space behind the boulder (north of it) is blocked. So to successfully push the boulder, the agent needs to be positioned such that pushing it would move it into a free space towards a fountain.

In the current observation, the fountains are very near west. So maybe there's a fountain at (37,10) or nearby. The agent is at (38,10). If there's a boulder at (39,10), pushing it west to (37,10) would place it on a fountain. But looking at the map, the agent's east direction at x=39 is a `{`, which might be a wall. Alternatively, the boulder is to the south, at (38,9). If the agent moves south to (38,9), then pushes the boulder north into (38,8), but need to check if (38,8) is a valid space.

Alternatively, the boulder adjacent north means the agent is facing north, and the boulder is north of them. So to push it, they need to move into the boulder's position, which would push it further north. But if the space beyond the boulder is blocked, that won't work. The agent's current position is (38,10). The boulder is at (38,9). If they move north to (38,9), then push north to (38,8), but what's at (38,8)? The map's line for y=8 is `#######..#`, which at x=38 is the 8th character (assuming 0-based index). Let's count: ""#######..#"" has 11 characters. Position 38 would be beyond the map's visible area, but perhaps it's a wall or a floor. If it's a floor, then pushing the boulder there is possible, but if it's a wall, then not.

Given that the agent's previous attempts to move north resulted in failure, maybe the path behind the boulder is blocked. Therefore, the agent should look for another boulder that can be pushed towards a fountain. The language observation mentions boulders near southsoutheast. Maybe moving east or southeast to reach that boulder.

Alternatively, check the stairs up far west. Maybe the goal is to reach the stairs, but the task is to push boulders onto fountains. The agent needs to focus on that.

Looking at the cursor's position and the map, the agent is in a corridor with bars on the sides. The fountains are to the west. The boulder adjacent north is at (38,9). If the agent moves north to (38,9), then tries to push the boulder north again, but if that's blocked, they might need to try a different direction. Alternatively, move west to reach another boulder.

In the current state, the best action might be to move north to get next to the boulder and attempt to push it. But previous attempts failed, so maybe the block is in the way. Alternatively, move west to interact with another boulder.

Wait, the language observation says ""boulder adjacent north"" and ""fountain very near west"". So if the agent can push the northern boulder towards the west fountain, that would solve the puzzle. To do that, the agent needs to be to the north of the boulder and push it west into the fountain. But the agent is currently at (38,10), and the boulder is at (38,9). So the agent needs to move north to (38,9), then push west into (37,9), which is a fountain if that's the case.

Looking at the map, at (37,9), the character is part of the line `#######` which is a wall (assuming `#` is a wall). So that's not possible. Therefore, pushing the boulder north might not be the way.

Alternatively, check if there's a boulder to the east. The language observation mentions boulders near southsoutheast. The agent is at (38,10). Moving east to (39,10) would be a `{` which might be a wall. Not useful. Moving south to (38,11) is a `.` which is a floor. Maybe there's a boulder there.

Wait, the latest map shows at y=11: ""##..`.#..#"". The agent's position is at x=38, y=10. Moving south to y=11, x=38 is a `.`, so it's a floor. Maybe there's a boulder further south. But the language observation says the boulder is adjacent north, so the main boulder is north.

Given that, perhaps the agent should try to push the northern boulder in a different direction. If moving north isn't working, maybe move west and try to push it west into a fountain. But the agent is at (38,10), west would be (37,10), which is a `{` (wall). Not possible.

Alternatively, move east to (39,10), which is a `{` (maybe a door or wall). Not helpful.

Hmm. Maybe the agent needs to reposition. Since pushing the northern boulder north is blocked, perhaps move south to get a different angle. Moving south to (38,11), then try to push the boulder east or west. But the boulder is at (38,9), so the agent would need to move to (38,9) first.

Wait, the agent is currently at (38,10). The boulder is at (38,9). To push the boulder, the agent needs to move into (38,9), then the boulder would move to (38,8). But (38,8) is part of the line `#######..#`, which at x=38 is the 9th character (since ""#######..#"" has 11 characters, indexes 0-10). The 9th character is a `.`, so it's a floor. So pushing the boulder north to (38,8) is possible. But does that lead to a fountain?

The fountain is very near west, so maybe at (37,8). If the boulder is pushed to (38,8), then from there, pushing west to (37,8) which is a fountain. But how to get there?

The agent would need to move north to (38,9), push the boulder north to (38,8), then move west to (37,8) and push again. But the agent's current position is (38,10). Let's outline the steps:

1. Move north to (38,9) to be next to the boulder.
2. Push the boulder north to (38,8).
3. Move west to (37,8).
4. Push the boulder west to (37,8), which is a fountain.

But need to check if each step is possible. When moving north to (38,9), there's a boulder there. So the agent would move into the boulder, pushing it north. If that space is free (a floor), then it works. Then, from (38,8), the agent can move west to (37,8), which is a floor, and push the boulder west into the fountain.

Alternatively, maybe the agent can push the boulder west directly from (38,9) into (37,9), but (37,9) is a `#` in the map's y=9 line: `""#<.{@.{..#""`—so at x=37, y=9 is a `{`, which is a wall. So can't push west there.

Therefore, the correct sequence would be to push the boulder north first, then west. So the agent's next action should be to move north to get next to the boulder, then push it north, then move west and push again.

But in the current observation, the agent is at (38,10). The latest action was 'east' which moved them to (38,10), but the boulder is still adjacent north. So the next step is to move north to (38,9), then push north.

However, previous attempts to move north resulted in the message ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" Which might indicate that when moving north, the agent was trying to push a boulder that's not in the direction they're moving. Wait, if the agent is at (38,10) and the boulder is at (38,9), then moving north would take the agent to (38,9), which is the boulder's position. So to push the boulder, the agent needs to move into it, i.e., move north into the boulder's spot, which would push the boulder north to (38,8). If that space is free, it should work.

But why did previous attempts fail? Maybe because when the agent tried to move north earlier, they were not adjacent to the boulder. Let me check the history. Earlier, the agent moved north from (42,10) to (42,9), but there was a boulder at (42,8), so moving north into (42,9) wouldn't push it. Now, in the current position, the agent is at (38,10) with the boulder at (38,9). So moving north to (38,9) would push the boulder to (38,8).

Assuming that (38,8) is a floor, the agent should move north and then push. So the next action should be 'north' to get next to the boulder, then 'push north' (but the available actions are only move directions). Wait, the action choices are only north, east, south, west. So to push a boulder, the agent must move in the direction opposite to where they want to push it. For example, to push a boulder north, the agent must move south into it.

Wait, no. In Sokoban-like games, to push a boulder to the north, the agent needs to move north into the boulder's space, which then pushes the boulder north. So if the agent is at (x,y) and the boulder is at (x,y+1), the agent can move north to (x,y+1), pushing the boulder to (x,y+2).

In this case, the agent is at (38,10), boulder at (38,9). The agent needs to move north to (38,9), which is the boulder's current position. That would push the boulder to (38,8). If (38,8) is a floor, this works.

But in previous steps, when the agent tried to move north, they got the message ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" That might have been because the space beyond the boulder was blocked. Let's check the map again. The line for y=8 is `#######..#`, which at x=38 is the 9th character (0-based index 8). The string is ""#######..#"", which is 11 characters. Index 8 is the 9th character, which is a `.`, so it's a floor. So pushing the boulder to (38,8) should be possible.

Therefore, the correct action now is to move north to (38,9) to push the boulder north to (38,8). Then, from there, move west to (37,8) and push the boulder west into the fountain at (37,8).

But the agent's current position is (38,10), and the boulder is at (38,9). So the next action should be 'north' to move into the boulder and push it north.

",-0.001,False
50,south,"<reasoning>
Let's see. The agent is in Boxoban, pushing boulders onto fountains. The goal is to move the boulder adjacent north (from the initial observation) onto a fountain. The cursor position is (38,10), and there's a boulder at (38,9) north of the agent. The map shows several obstacles like bars and dark areas, which are probably walls or impassable.

First, the agent needs to navigate to the boulder. The last action was north, moving from (38,10) to (38,9). Now, looking at the current map, the boulder is directly north at (38,9). But the agent is at (38,9) now, so to push the boulder, the agent needs to move into it from the direction opposite to where the boulder needs to go. The boulder adjacent north is the one at (38,9), so the agent is currently adjacent to it. To push it, the agent needs to move south into the boulder, but that would just move it back. Instead, the agent needs to find a space where pushing the boulder would lead it to a fountain.

Looking at the language observations, there's a fountain very near west and westnorthwest. The stairs up are far west, so maybe the fountains are in those western areas. The bars are all around, so the agent needs to find a path westward. The current position is (38,9), and the agent tried moving west before but hit bars. Let me check the map again. The map shows that at position (38,9), the agent is next to a boulder. To the west, there's a bar adjacent, so moving west isn't possible. The agent needs to move in a direction where the boulder can be pushed towards a fountain.

Since the fountain is westnorthwest, maybe the agent should head west and then north or south to position the boulder over the fountain. But the bars are blocking direct paths. Alternatively, maybe the agent can move the boulder into a corridor that leads to a fountain. Let's see the map again. The map has a series of `#` which are walls, and `{` and `.` which might be floors or other elements. The boulder is at (38,9), and the agent is at (38,9) as well? Wait, the cursor is at (38,9), and the boulder adjacent north would be at (38,8)? No, maybe the coordinates are different. Wait, in the initial observations, the agent was at (42,10) and moved around. Now after several moves, the agent is at (38,9) with the boulder at (38,9) adjacent north? That might mean the boulder is in the same row but north of the agent. Wait, coordinates in NetHack are typically (y, x) or (x, y)? The cursor says (x=38, y=10) initially, then moves. So movement is north, south, east, west changing x or y accordingly. If the agent is at (38,9) and the boulder is adjacent north, that would be at (38,8). But in the map, the line for y=9 has `##{.@##.`#`, so the agent's position is at the `<` symbol, which is probably in the middle of that line. Let me parse the map again.

The map lines are for each y-coordinate. The agent's current position is (38,9), which corresponds to the line for y=9. The line is `##{.@##.`#`. The `<` symbol is likely the agent's position. Let's count the characters. Each line seems to have 20 characters or so. So the `<` is somewhere in that line. Suppose it's at position 38. The boulder adjacent north would be in y=8, same x. Looking at y=8's line: `##..`.#..#`, which doesn't show a boulder. Maybe the initial description was different. Alternatively, perhaps the boulder is in the same cell as the agent? No, because the message says ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain"" when trying to push it. So the agent must be adjacent to the boulder.

Given the confusion in the map parsing, perhaps the best approach is to try to move the agent in a direction that allows pushing the boulder towards a fountain. Since the fountain is westnorthwest, maybe moving west and then north could position the boulder there. However, bars are blocking direct movement west. The agent is at (38,9), and west is blocked by bars. So maybe the agent needs to move south to get around the bars and find a path west. Alternatively, check if there's a path to the westnorthwest fountain by moving west then north.

Another approach: since the boulder is north of the agent, the agent needs to push it south into a fountain. But the current position has a fountain very near west. If the boulder can be moved west towards the fountain, that would be ideal. But the agent is at (38,9), and to push the boulder west, the agent needs to move west into the boulder, which would require that the cell to the west of the boulder (38,9 west to 37,9) is empty or a fountain. Looking at the map, the cell at (37,9) is part of the line `#<.{..{..#` for y=9. The `#` indicates a wall, so the agent can't push the boulder west because that's a wall. Therefore, pushing west is impossible.

Next option: push the boulder north. But the agent is already north of the boulder. Wait, if the boulder is adjacent north, then the agent is south of it. To push the boulder north, the agent would need to move north into the boulder, but that cell (38,8) might be blocked. Looking at y=8's line: `##..`.#..#`, which has a `.` at position 38, so maybe that's a floor. If the agent moves north into the boulder, it would push the boulder to (38,8), which is a floor. Then check if (38,8) is near a fountain. The fountains are very near west, so (38,8) west would be (37,8), which might be a wall or bar. Not sure. Alternatively, after pushing north, the boulder could be moved further north towards a fountain.

But the agent's current goal is to get the boulder onto a fountain. The closest fountain is westnorthwest. So perhaps pushing the boulder west and then north. But west is blocked. Alternatively, move the agent west to a position where pushing the boulder is possible. The agent is at (38,9). Moving west to (37,9) is blocked by a bar. So that's not possible. Moving south to (38,10), but that's where the agent was before, with bars adjacent. Maybe move south and then west? Let's see. From (38,9), move south to (38,10), then try to move west. The bars adjacent at (38,10) are northeast, east, and southeast. So west from (38,10) would be to (37,10), which might be a bar or passage. Looking at the map line for y=10: `#<.{@.{..#`, which at x=37 is `{`, so possibly a floor. If the agent moves south to (38,10), then west to (37,10), that could be a path. Once there, maybe push the boulder west or north.

Alternatively, the agent could try to move the boulder into the fountain at westnorthwest. To do that, the boulder needs to be moved west and north. But the agent is blocked west. Maybe the agent needs to find a different path. Another idea: check if there's a staircase up that leads to another level, but the stairs up are far west. Maybe descending isn't helpful here.

Given the current position and the obstacles, the best immediate action might be to move south to (38,10) and then attempt to move west to (37,10), avoiding bars. Once there, perhaps push the boulder in a direction towards the fountain. Alternatively, try to move the boulder north into a position where it can be pushed west later.

But considering the previous failed attempts and the need to avoid repeating the same actions, the agent should try a new direction. Since moving north again resulted in the same message, perhaps moving south and then west is better. Let's proceed with moving south to (38,10) and then west to (37,10) if possible.

Let's see where I am. The map shows some bars and dark areas around. The agent is at (38, 10). There's a boulder adjacent to the north, which I saw in previous observations. The goal is to push boulders onto fountains. In the latest map, the cursor is on '@' which is me, and there's a '{' which might be a boulder. The fountain is at westnorthwest, so probably to the northwest direction.

Looking at the language observations, there's a fountain very near west, so maybe moving west towards that. But there are bars blocking some paths. The bars are very near north, northeast, etc., so maybe moving west is a better option. Let me check the map again. The map at (38,10) has a '<.{@.{..#'. So maybe the boulder is in the position where the '{' is. Wait, the '@' is me. The boulder might be in the same cell as '{' which is to the east or west? Maybe the map's ASCII art needs parsing. Let me try to visualize the map row by row.

The map lines are all the same except for the tenth line. Let's look at the tenth line: ""##.###...#"". Hmm, not sure. The agent's position is x=38, y=10. Maybe the boulder is near here. The message says there's a boulder adjacent north. So if I'm at (38,10), north would be (38,9). Looking at the map line for y=9: ""##{.@##.`#"". The '@' is in that line at position corresponding to x=38. So the boulder is at (38,9) under the '{'. But I'm at (38,10), so north would take me to (38,9), which has a boulder. But pushing it would require moving into it from the south. However, the bars are very near north, so maybe there's a bar blocking the path north. 

Wait, the latest observation says there's a boulder adjacent north. So if I try to move north, I might hit the boulder. But to push it, I need to move into it when there's space behind. The message also mentioned that before, when I tried to move north, it said ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" That probably means there's no space behind the boulder to push it. 

Alternatively, maybe I should move west towards the fountain. The fountain is very near west, so moving west from (38,10) would take me to (37,10). Checking the map at x=37, y=10: the line is ""#<.{@.{..#"". The '<' might be a door or a passage. Wait, the '<' usually represents a staircase down, but in this case, the cursor is at (38,10), so maybe the '<' is to the west of that. Wait, perhaps the map's columns are a bit different. Let me recheck the map structure.

The map's tenth line (y=10) is: ""#<.{@.{..#"". So at x=38, y=10, the character is '@'. The cells to the west would be x=37, which is '<', then '.'s. So moving west from (38,10) would take me to x=37, y=10, which is a '<'. But '<' in NetHack usually indicates a staircase down, but since the message says stairs up far west, maybe that's a different staircase. However, moving west into '<' might be possible if it's a passable staircase. But the inventory doesn't show any stairs item, so perhaps it's a regular passage. Alternatively, maybe it's a locked door. 

But the latest language observation says ""fountain very near west"", so moving west should lead towards it. The bars adjacent north, northeast, east, and northwest—so west might be clear. The boulder is adjacent north, so moving north isn't helpful. Maybe I should try to push the boulder to the northwest towards the fountain. To push the boulder, I need to move into it from the south. So if the boulder is at (38,9), I need to be at (38,9) and then push it north to (38,8), but there might be bars there. The bars are very near north, so perhaps (38,8) is blocked by bars. 

Alternatively, maybe the boulder can be pushed west. If the boulder is at (38,9), pushing it west to (37,9) might be possible if there's space. But the observation doesn't mention a boulder near west. Let me check the language observation again: ""boulder adjacent north"" and ""boulder very near eastnortheast and westsouthwest"". So the boulder at (38,9) is north of me. If I try to push it west, I need to move into it from the east. So from (38,10), move east into the boulder at (38,9) and push it west to (37,9). But is there a path behind it? The observation says there are bars near westsouthwest, so maybe (37,9) is blocked. 

Alternatively, maybe I should move west to reach the fountain. Let's try west. The last action was west, and the agent is back at (38,10). So maybe moving west again isn't helping. Alternatively, check the map again. At (38,10), west is '<', which might be a staircase down. If I move west into '<', maybe that's a way to proceed. But I'm not sure if that's safe. Alternatively, maybe the boulder can be pushed in another direction. 

Wait, the fountain is very near west, so perhaps moving west towards it and then finding a way to push the boulder. But the boulder is north of me. Maybe I need to move north to the boulder and then push it west towards the fountain. But moving north would take me to (38,9), which has the boulder. If I try to push it, I need to be adjacent and have space behind. If I'm at (38,9) and push the boulder west to (37,9), but there might be bars there. The bars are very near north, so (37,9) could be blocked. 

Alternatively, maybe the boulder can be pushed south into a different position. But that doesn't help the fountain. Hmm. Maybe I should try to move northwest. From (38,10), northwest would be to (37,9). If I can get there, maybe I can push the boulder. But to get to (37,9), I need to move west then north, but there's a boulder at (38,9). So first, move west to (37,10), then north to (37,9). But (37,9) is the position where the boulder might be after being pushed. Wait, the current boulder is at (38,9). If I move west to (37,10), then from there, move north to (37,9) and push the boulder from (38,9) to (37,9). But is (37,9) passable? There are bars very near north, so maybe that cell is blocked. 

This is getting complicated. Let's look at the latest observations. The boulder is adjacent north, and there's a fountain very near west. The bars are adjacent northeast, so moving east might not be good. Maybe the best bet is to move west towards the fountain and see. If there's a staircase or a passage, that could lead to the fountain. Alternatively, try to push the boulder north into a position where it can be pushed towards the fountain. 

Alternatively, since the agent is at (38,10), and the fountain is westnorthwest, maybe moving west then north. But the bars are adjacent northeast, so west might be clearer. Let's try moving west again to (37,10). If that's passable, then proceed. The previous move west got back to (38,10), so maybe there's a loop. Alternatively, check the map again. At (37,10), the cell is '<', which might be a door or a staircase. If it's a staircase down, moving west into it might change levels, but the problem is to stay on the current level. 

Alternatively, perhaps the boulder can be pushed west from its current position (38,9) to (37,9). To do that, I need to be at (38,9) and push it west. So first, move north to (38,9), then push west. But moving north to (38,9) would require moving into the boulder, which is possible if I'm trying to push it. So action: north, then push west. But the problem is that the previous attempts to move north resulted in trying to move the boulder but failing, which might mean there's no space behind. 

Wait, the message when trying to move north before was ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" That suggests that moving north into the boulder didn't work, possibly because there's no space behind it. So pushing the boulder north isn't possible. What about pushing it west? From (38,9), pushing west to (37,9). To do that, I need to be at (38,9) and move west into the boulder. So the sequence would be: move north to (38,9), then push west (action: west). If that works, the boulder would move to (37,9). Then, check if that cell is passable. The bars are very near north, so (37,9) might be blocked by bars. 

Alternatively, maybe the boulder can be pushed south into a different position. But that doesn't help the fountain. 

Another approach: look for the fountain's location. The fountain is at westnorthwest, which would be northwest from the agent's current position. From (38,10), northwest would be (37,9). So if the boulder can be moved to (37,9), that would place it on the fountain. But is (37,9) a fountain? The latest observation says fountain very near west, so perhaps the fountain is at (37,10) or similar. Hmm, the language observation says ""fountain very near west"", which might be at (37,10). So if I can move the boulder to (37,10), that would solve it. 

But the boulder is currently at (38,9). To get it to (37,10), I need to push it south and west. First, push it west from (38,9) to (37,9), then push it south to (37,10). But (37,9) might be blocked by bars. The bars are very near north, so possibly (37,9) has a bar. If that's the case, pushing the boulder there isn't possible. 

Alternatively, maybe there's another boulder further south that I can push. The observation mentions boulders near southsoutheast. But I'm not sure of their positions. 

Given the limited information, the safest bet might be to move towards the fountain west and see if I can find a way to push the boulder from there. Alternatively, try to push the boulder west from its current position. 

So, the next action could be to move north into the boulder and then push west. The sequence would be: north (to (38,9)), then west (to push the boulder to (37,9)). If that's possible, then maybe proceed. But need to check if there's space behind the boulder at (37,9). The bars are very near north, so perhaps (37,9) is blocked. 

Alternatively, if moving west from (38,10) is possible, then go there and check. The latest observation shows that moving west from (38,10) leads to (37,10), which has a '<' character. If that's a passable staircase or door, moving west might be okay. 

Given the uncertainty, perhaps the best immediate action is to move west towards the fountain, as that direction seems closer to the goal. So the action would be west.

",-0.001,False

Let's try to figure out what to do next. The agent is in a Boxoban-like environment and needs to push boulders onto fountains.

First, looking at the map, the agent's current position is (x=37, y=10). The cursor shows the agent's position as a tourist, and there's a boulder marked with @ adjacent to the agent (since the map shows #<.@..{..# at position x=37, y=10). The nearest fountain is mentioned in the language observation as being very near west, which is to the west of the agent's current position.

The goal is to push the boulder towards the fountain. Since the agent is west of the boulder (the @ is adjacent to the < which represents the agent), the agent needs to move west to be next to the boulder. Then, by moving west again while pushing the boulder, it can be moved towards the fountain.

But wait, the last few actions were moving west multiple times, and the boulder was adjacent north. Maybe the agent needs to reposition themselves to be directly behind the boulder. Let me check the map again. The map shows:

#<.@..{..#

So, the agent is at x=37, y=10, and the boulder is at x=38, y=10 (the @ symbol). The fountain is adjacent west, which would be at x=36, y=10. So the agent is at 37, needs to get to 36 to be next to the boulder, then push it west to 35, which is the fountain.

But in the previous steps, the agent moved west from 38 to 37, but the boulder was at 38. Wait, maybe the agent is now at 37, and the boulder is at 38. So the agent should move west again to be at 38, then push the boulder west to 37, which is the fountain location.

Wait, the fountain is at westnorthwest, but the immediate adjacent west is the fountain. The language observation says ""fountain adjacent west"", which would be at x=36, y=10.

So the plan is: move west to be next to the boulder (currently at 38,10), then push the boulder west to 37,10, which is the fountain.

But in the current observation, the agent is at (37,10), and the boulder is at (38,10). So the agent needs to move west once more to get next to the boulder. Once there, pushing west would move the boulder to the fountain.

But the previous actions tried moving west multiple times, but perhaps the agent is already adjacent? Let me check the map again. The map line is #<.@..{..# at position 37,10. The < is the agent, and the @ is the boulder one space to the east. So to get next to the boulder, the agent needs to move west once, from x=37 to x=38? Wait, no. In MiniHack/NetHack coordinates, moving west decreases the x-coordinate. Wait, in the map, the leftmost side is x=0, and moving east increases x. So if the agent is at x=37, moving west would take them to x=36. But the boulder is at x=38, y=10 (since the @ is next to the < in the map string). So the agent is at 37,10, and the boulder is at 38,10. To be adjacent to the boulder, the agent needs to move east to 38,10. Then, pushing west would move the boulder to 37,10, which is the fountain.

Ah, right! Because in the map string, the agent is at the position of the <, which is followed by @, meaning the boulder is to the east of the agent. So the agent is at (37,10), and the boulder is at (38,10). To push the boulder, the agent needs to be adjacent to it and move in the direction opposite to where they want to push. So to push the boulder west (towards the fountain at 36,10), the agent needs to move east to 38,10 (be next to the boulder), then move west while pushing, which would move the boulder to 37,10.

Therefore, the correct sequence is: move east to 38,10, then move west to push the boulder to 37,10, which is the fountain. 

But in the current observation, the agent is at (37,10), and the boulder is at (38,10). So the immediate action should be to move east to get next to the boulder. Then, after that, push west. However, the agent's previous actions included moving west multiple times, perhaps not positioning correctly.

But according to the latest map, the agent is at 37,10, and the boulder is at 38,10. So the agent needs to move east once to be adjacent. Then, push west. The message history shows that previous attempts to push resulted in ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" which probably means the agent wasn't adjacent. So now, moving east to get next to the boulder is necessary.

So the next action should be east.

Let me try to figure out what to do next. The goal is to push boulders onto fountains. From the current observations, the map shows some fountains and boulders around. The agent is at (38,10). Looking at the map, there's a boulder very near north, and fountains near westnorthwest and south.

In previous steps, the agent tried moving west multiple times but encountered bars that they couldn't pass through. The message said ""You cannot pass through the bars."" So those bars are obstacles blocking the path. The boulder adjacent north might be next to the agent, so maybe pushing it south towards the fountain westnorthwest would work. 

The agent needs to check if there's a clear path behind the boulder. If moving north into the boulder and then pushing it south, that could place it on the fountain. The latest observation shows a boulder very near north, so probably right at the agent's current position north. Let me confirm the map: the agent's position is x=38, y=10. The map line for y=10 shows a '@' at position 38. The line above (y=9) has a '{' which might be a wall or obstacle. So pushing the boulder north might not be possible if there's a wall, but pushing it south towards the fountain westnorthwest could work if the path is clear.

The fountains are westnorthwest, so moving the boulder in that direction. Since the agent is at (38,10), westnorthwest would be towards lower x and lower y coordinates. But the agent's current y is 10, and moving north would take y to 9, which has a '{' (maybe a bar or wall). So pushing the boulder south (y=11) might be possible if that path is clear. Looking at the map, the line for y=11 (if exists) might have a '.' or other floor. Wait, the map provided only shows up to y=9 in some areas, maybe due to rendering. The agent's current y is 10, and the boulder is adjacent north, so maybe the boulder is at (38,9). To push it, the agent needs to move north into it, then push further. But if moving north is blocked by a bar, that's not possible. 

Alternatively, the agent could try to move around the boulder. Since the boulder is north, maybe moving west or east first to get a better position to push it south. But previous attempts to move west hit bars. Alternatively, check if there's a path to the south of the boulder. If the agent can move south (y=11) and then push the boulder south into the fountain. 

Looking at the language observation, there's a fountain very near west, which is probably in the same general direction as the agent's current position. The boulder near westsouthwest might be another one, but the immediate one to handle is the one adjacent north. 

So the plan is: move north into the boulder, then push it south towards the fountain. But first, check if moving north is possible. The message when trying to move north before resulted in ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" That might mean there's something blocking the path. Wait, the agent already tried moving north once when there was a boulder adjacent north, and it didn't work. Maybe the path behind the boulder is blocked. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to move west or east to reposition. But movement west has been blocked by bars. Maybe the agent should try pushing the boulder in a different direction. If the boulder is north, perhaps pushing it west or east if there's a path. But the fountain is westnorthwest, so pushing it west would get closer. 

Alternatively, check if there are multiple boulders. The observation mentions boulders near southsouthwest and very near north. The one near north is adjacent, so that's the priority. 

Given the previous attempts, the agent might need to find a way to navigate around the bars to reach the boulder. But given the current position and the bars blocking west movement, maybe the best action is to try pushing the boulder south again, even if it didn't work before, but perhaps the state has changed. 

Alternatively, check if the boulder can be pushed west into the fountain. If the fountain is westnorthwest, pushing the boulder west would place it closer. 

But without knowing the exact layout beyond the agent's position, it's a bit tricky. The safest bet given the current info is to try pushing the boulder south into the fountain. So the action would be to move north into the boulder and then push it south. However, the agent needs to be adjacent to the boulder to push it. Since the boulder is adjacent north, moving north would place the agent next to it, then push it south. 

Wait, the agent is already at (38,10). The boulder is adjacent north, so at (38,9). To push it, the agent needs to move north into it, then push in the desired direction. So first action: north. But the previous attempt to move north resulted in ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" That might be because there's something blocking the path behind the boulder. So pushing north into the boulder isn't possible if the path behind is blocked. 

In that case, the agent needs to find another way. Maybe move west or east to get a side view of the boulder. But movement west is blocked by bars. East might be possible. Let's check the bars adjacent northeast, southeast, etc. The bars adjacent northeast, so moving east might hit a bar. 

Alternatively, the agent could try to move south to the boulder's current position. But the boulder is at (38,9), agent is at (38,10). Moving south would reach the boulder. Then push it north or south. But pushing it north would be into the '{' at y=9, which is a bar, so that's blocking. Pushing it south to y=11. If the path there is clear, that would work. 

So the steps would be: move south to (38,9), then push the boulder south to (38,10). But the agent is already at (38,10), and the boulder is at (38,9). So moving south would place the agent next to the boulder. Then, the agent can push it south. 

Wait, but in the previous steps, when the agent tried moving north into the boulder, it didn't work. Maybe because the path behind the boulder is blocked. So perhaps the agent should first move west or east to get a different angle. But movement west is blocked by bars. 

Alternatively, the agent could try to push the boulder west into the fountain. If the boulder is at (38,9), pushing it west to (37,9) might place it next to the fountain westnorthwest. But the agent needs to be adjacent to the boulder to push it west. So first move north to (38,9), then push west. 

But again, the previous attempt to move north resulted in an error message. Maybe the path behind the boulder is blocked, making it impossible to push. 

Given the uncertainty, the best next action might be to try pushing the boulder south again, in case the state has changed. So the action would be to move north into the boulder and then push it south. But since the agent is already north of the boulder? Wait, no. The agent is at (38,10), and the boulder is adjacent north, so at (38,9). So the agent needs to move north to (38,9) to interact with the boulder. 

So the action sequence would be: north, then push south. But the previous attempt to move north resulted in an error. Wait, the message when moving north previously was ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" That implies that the agent tried to move into the boulder but failed, possibly because there's no space behind it. 

So perhaps the agent should first move west or east to get a different direction to push. But movement west is blocked. 

Alternatively, check if there's another boulder to handle. The observation mentions boulders near southsouthwest. Maybe focusing on that one. But the immediate one is north. 

Alternatively, the agent could try to move south to the stairs up near west, but that's probably not helpful. 

Given the constraints, the best action is to attempt to move north into the boulder again, even if it failed before, maybe the state has updated. Or perhaps the agent should try pushing the boulder west into the fountain. 

Another possibility is that the agent is next to the boulder and needs to push it. The correct action would be to push the boulder in a direction. Since the agent is at (38,10) and the boulder is at (38,9), pushing it south to (38,10) would require the agent to be adjacent and then push. Wait, no. To push the boulder south, the agent needs to be north of it. So the agent is at (38,10), boulder at (38,9). So the agent can push the boulder south by moving south into it. Wait, no: to push a boulder, you move into it in the direction you want to push. So if the agent is north of the boulder (i.e., at (38,10) and the boulder is at (38,9)), the agent needs to move south into the boulder to push it further south to (38,8). 

But in that case, the agent's current position is (38,10), and to push the boulder south, the agent would move south into it. So the action would be south. But the agent is already trying to move south, and the latest observation shows a message when moving south previously was ""You cannot pass through the bars."" But that might have been due to different bars. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent is facing a different obstacle. Given the confusion in the map rendering, perhaps the best action is to try pushing the boulder south again. So the chosen action is to move south, which would push the boulder further south if possible.

Let's see. I need to figure out the best move here. The agent is in a Boxoban-like environment, trying to push boulders onto fountains. The previous attempts involved moving west multiple times but ended up hitting bars or obstacles. The last message says trying to move the boulder failed, which probably means there's a boulder in the way or positioned such that pushing it isn't possible right now.

Looking at the map, the agent's position is (38,10). The boulders are near westsouthwest and southsoutheast. The fountains are in various directions, but the closest one seems to be westnorthwest, based on the observations. The stairs up are far west, so maybe moving towards west is a goal eventually, but first, need to arrange the boulders on fountains.

The agent just tried moving south and ended up where they were before. The cursor is back at (38,10). The adjacent boulder is north, according to the language observation. So maybe the agent needs to move in a direction that allows pushing the northern boulder towards a fountain.

Wait, the latest observation after moving south says there's a boulder adjacent north. So the agent is at (38,10), and the boulder is north of them. To push the boulder, the agent would need to move north into it, but that might not be possible if there's a barrier. The bars are very near north, northnortheast, etc. So maybe the path is blocked by bars, making it impossible to push the boulder north.

Alternatively, maybe the agent should move west again to get closer to another boulder? The boulders are also near southsoutheast. But moving west might lead into more bars. The fountains are near south and west, so perhaps pushing a boulder towards the west fountain would be better.

Looking at the map, the agent's current position is near some symbols like `<` and `{` which might be part of the level layout. The '@' symbol represents the agent. The `*` symbols are boulders, and `f` are fountains. The bars are probably walls or obstacles.

The agent needs to navigate around the bars to get to the boulders. Since moving north resulted in a blocked path, maybe moving west again could position the agent to push a boulder south towards a fountain. But the previous attempts to move west didn't lead to progress. Alternatively, moving east might open up a path? But the east side has dark areas and bars, which are probably obstacles.

Another thought: the stairs up are far west, but the goal is to push boulders on fountains. So the immediate priority is to manipulate the boulders onto fountains. The boulder adjacent north (at (38,9)) could be pushed south if there's space. But the bars are very near north, so maybe the path is blocked. Alternatively, if the agent moves north, they might be able to push the boulder further north, but that's unlikely to lead to a fountain.

Wait, the fountain is very near west. So maybe pushing a boulder towards the west direction. The agent is at (38,10). If they move west to (37,10), then perhaps they can position to push a boulder west into the fountain. But the last observation showed a boulder adjacent south at (38,10). So moving west to (37,10), then maybe move south to get behind the boulder and push it west?

Alternatively, check if there's a boulder to the south. The language observation mentions boulders near southsoutheast, so maybe moving southeast could reach it. But the agent's current position is (38,10), and moving southeast would take them to (39,11), but the map's south and east areas have dark areas and bars, which are obstacles.

Another angle: the agent's inventory has various items, but none seem immediately useful for moving boulders. The key is to navigate around obstacles and find a path to push boulders onto fountains.

Given the previous movements and the current position, the agent seems to be oscillating between west and south without making progress. Maybe a different approach is needed. Let's look at the cursor position and the map again. The map shows some structure with `#` as walls, `.` as ground, `{` and `<` as part of the level layout, and `@` as the agent. The boulders are `*`.

The agent is at (38,10), which is near a `#` wall on the west side (since they've been moving west into bars). The fountain is westnorthwest, so maybe moving northwest could reach it. But the bars are very near northwest, so that path might be blocked.

Wait, the latest observation after moving west to (37,10) shows a boulder adjacent southeast. So at (37,10), the boulder is to the southeast, which would be (38,11). But the agent is at (37,10), so pushing that boulder west would take it to (37,9), which might be towards a fountain.

But the agent is currently at (38,10) after moving back east. Maybe the plan is to move west to (37,10), then move south to (37,11), and then push the boulder west? But need to check for obstacles.

Alternatively, since the agent is stuck trying to move north into a boulder that's blocked by bars, perhaps the best move is to try a different direction. Given the previous attempts, moving west again might not be effective. Maybe try moving south again to get a different angle.

But the message says that moving the boulder failed, which might indicate that the agent is trying to push it into a wall or another obstacle. So perhaps the agent needs to position themselves such that pushing the boulder in a direction where there's space.

Looking at the map, the agent's current position is at (38,10). To the north is a boulder, and to the west are bars. To the south, there's a boulder near southsoutheast. To the east, there are bars. The only open direction might be south, but moving south didn't help before.

Wait, the fountain is very near east, so maybe pushing a boulder from the southsoutheast area towards the east fountain. But the agent needs to reach that boulder. The agent is at (38,10), and the boulders are near southsoutheast, which would be in the direction of (39,11) or similar. However, moving southeast is blocked by dark areas and bars.

This is getting a bit complicated. Given the constraints and the need to avoid repeating the same actions without progress, perhaps the best next step is to try moving west again to (37,10) to see if there's a path to push a boulder west towards the fountain. Alternatively, move north to interact with the northern boulder again, but that might just hit the bars again.

Another idea: since the agent has a blessed potion of extra healing and other items, but they don't seem relevant to moving boulders. The key is to use the movement actions effectively. Maybe the agent needs to reposition to a location where they can push a boulder in a free direction.

Considering all this, the next action could be to move west once more to (37,10) to see if there's a clearer path or a boulder that can be pushed towards the west fountain.

Let me try to figure out what to do next. The agent is in Boxoban, pushing boulders onto fountains. The goal is to get all the boulders to the fountains.

Looking at the current state, the agent is at position (37, 10). The map shows a boulder adjacent to the northwest direction, maybe near the cursor position. There's also a fountain to the west. The bars around are indicating walls or obstacles. 

Previously, the agent tried moving west multiple times but hit some bars, which are probably walls. The last movement was west, which took them to (37,10). The message after moving west didn't mention pushing a boulder, so maybe there's a boulder nearby that the agent can push. 

Looking at the cursor position and the map, the character is '@' which is the agent. The map shows `<.{@..{..#` which suggests there's a boulder ('@') next to some other objects. Wait, in the map, the agent's position is (37,10). The map line for that position is `#<.@..{..#`, so the '<' is the agent facing west, '@' is the boulder, and '.' are empty spaces. 

So the boulder is adjacent to the agent. To push it towards the fountain, which is to the westnorthwest. The agent is facing west, so pushing the boulder north or south might not be the way. Wait, the fountain is adjacent west, so maybe pushing the boulder west into the fountain. But the agent is already facing west. Let me check the map again. 

The map line for y=10 is `#<.@..{..#`. The agent is at x=37, which is the position of '<', so facing west. The boulder is at x=38, y=10 (the '@'). To push the boulder west, the agent needs to move into it while facing the correct direction. Since the agent is facing west, moving west (which is the direction they were already facing) would push the boulder. But the previous attempts to move west didn't result in a message about pushing, maybe because there's a wall blocking the path. 

Wait, the language observation mentions bars very near eastnortheast, east, southeast, and westnorthwest. So, when trying to push the boulder west, there might be a bar (wall) to the west of the boulder. If that's the case, the agent can't push the boulder further west. Alternatively, maybe the agent can push it in another direction. 

Looking at the fountains, there's one adjacent west. So perhaps the boulder needs to be moved to that fountain. If the agent can't push it west directly due to a wall, maybe pushing it north or south towards the fountain. But the fountain is to the west, so the best way is to push the boulder west into the fountain. 

But why didn't the previous attempt to move west work? Let me check the history. The last action was west, leading to position (37,10). The message was empty, meaning no obstacle. The boulder is at (38,10). So the agent is at (37,10) facing west. To push the boulder west, the agent needs to move west again, which would push the boulder to (39,10). However, the language observation says there's a bar very near westnorthwest. Maybe at (39,10) there's a bar, preventing the boulder from moving further. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent can push the boulder north or south. Let me check the map. The map at y=9 is `##{.@##.`#`, which might have obstacles. If the agent tries to push the boulder north, moving to (38,9) might be possible if there's no wall there. The fountain is adjacent west at (38,10), so maybe pushing the boulder north into a space that leads to the fountain. 

But the agent's current position is (37,10), facing west. To push the boulder north, the agent needs to move north while facing west, which isn't directly possible. The agent has to turn first. But turning would take actions, and the tip says to avoid repeating actions. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent should try pushing the boulder east. But that would take it away from the fountain. 

Wait, the fountains are at westnorthwest. The current boulder is at (38,10), and the agent is at (37,10). The fountain is adjacent west, so (38,10) west is (39,10), but there's a bar there. So the boulder can't go further west. Therefore, maybe the agent needs to push the boulder north or south into a position that leads to the fountain. 

Looking at the map, the y=9 line for x=38 is `{.@##.`#, which has obstacles. Maybe pushing the boulder north to (38,9) is possible. The agent would need to face north and push. But the agent is currently facing west. So maybe the agent should turn north, then move north to push the boulder. 

However, the agent's previous actions have been moving west repeatedly. The tip says to avoid the same action unless necessary. Turning might be needed here. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent can push the boulder south. The y=11 line for x=38 is `...#`, which might be clear. If the agent moves south while facing west, that would push the boulder to (38,11). If that's allowed, then maybe the boulder can be moved into a position closer to the fountain. 

But I need to check the obstacles. The language observation mentions bars very near eastnortheast, east, southeast, and westnorthwest. So at (39,10) there's a bar, which is the westnorthwest direction from the boulder's position (38,10). Therefore, pushing west is blocked. Pushing north might be possible if the path is clear. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent can push the boulder east. But that's away from the fountain. 

So the best option is to try pushing the boulder north or south. The agent needs to face the correct direction. Since the agent is currently facing west, they can't push north or south directly. They need to turn. 

Possible actions: turn north, then move north to push. Or turn south, move south to push. 

But the agent's inventory doesn't show any items that would help here. The goal is to push the boulder to the fountain. Since pushing west is blocked, maybe pushing north into a corridor that leads to the fountain. 

Alternatively, check if there's a different boulder. The language observation mentions a boulder adjacent northwest. Wait, the current boulder is at (38,10), and the agent is at (37,10). The adjacent positions would be (38,10) northwest is (37,9), which might be a different boulder. 

Wait, the language observation says ""boulder adjacent northwest"". So there's another boulder at (37,9). The agent is at (37,10). So maybe the agent can handle that other boulder first. 

But the primary goal is to get the boulder at (38,10) to the fountain at (38,9) or another position. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent should move to a different position to access the other boulder. 

But given the current position and the need to avoid repeating actions, the best immediate action is to attempt to push the nearby boulder. Since the agent is facing west, but pushing west is blocked, perhaps push north or south. 

To push north, the agent needs to move north while facing west. Wait, that's not possible. The agent has to face north first. So the sequence would be: turn north, then move north to push. 

But changing direction might be necessary. Alternatively, the agent can try moving north and see if there's a path. 

Alternatively, the agent can move north to (37,9), which is the position of the other boulder. 

Looking at the map, at (37,9), the character is '{', which might be a corner or a different object. The agent's current y is 10, so moving north to y=9. 

The map line for y=9 is `##{.@##.`#. So at x=37, y=9, there's a '{', which could be a wall or a different structure. If the agent moves north to (37,9), they might hit a wall. 

Alternatively, the agent can try to move south to (37,11). The map line for y=11 is `...#`, which is unclear, but there's a bar very near westnorthwest, which could be at (39,10), so not directly affecting this movement. 

But perhaps the best approach is to push the boulder to the left (west) as much as possible. Since the agent is facing west, moving west again would push the boulder to (39,10), but there's a bar there, so it's blocked. 

Therefore, the agent cannot push the boulder further west. The next option is to push it north or south. 

To push north, the agent needs to face north. So turn north, then move north. 

The action sequence would be: north, then north again to push. 

But the agent's previous actions were all west, so turning north is a new action. 

Alternatively, the agent can try to move north while facing west, but that's not possible. 

So the chosen action should be to turn north and then push. But the agent has to perform individual actions. 

Given the current state, the agent is at (37,10) facing west. The immediate action could be to move north to check for obstacles. If there's no obstacle, then push the boulder north. 

Alternatively, since the agent's cursor is at (37,10), and the boulder is at (38,10), the agent can try to push the boulder by moving west again, but that's blocked. 

Wait, the message after moving west previously was empty, meaning no obstacle. So maybe the boulder is at (38,10), and the agent is at (37,10). Moving west again would push the boulder to (39,10), but there's a bar there, so the push would fail. 

Therefore, the correct action is to try pushing the boulder in a direction where there's no bar. Since pushing west is blocked, maybe push north. 

To do that, the agent needs to face north. So the action would be to turn north (using the 'north' action, which makes the agent face north), then move north to push the boulder. 

But in the game, turning is done by moving in the desired direction. So to face north, the agent can move north once, then again to attempt pushing. 

Alternatively, the agent can use the 'push' action, but the available actions are north, east, south, west. 

In Boxoban, pushing is done by moving towards the boulder in the direction you want to push it. So if the agent is facing north and moves north, and there's a boulder in front, it will push the boulder north. 

Given that, the agent should face north and then move north to push the boulder. 

So the sequence would be: north (to face north), then north again to push. 

But the agent needs to perform one action at a time. 

Current action options are north, east, south, west. 

So the first action is to turn north by moving north. Then, move north again to push. 

But the agent's current position is facing west. So moving north would change direction to north. 

Therefore, the next action should be 'north' to face north, then 'north' again to push. 

However, the prompt requires a single action. The agent has to choose one action now. 

Given that, the best immediate action is to move north to face the correct direction, allowing a subsequent push. 

But the agent's inventory and current state don't indicate any issues with movement. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent can move north directly to push the boulder if there's no obstruction. 

Looking at the map, the y=9 line for x=38 is '@' (the boulder). The line above (y=8) is `#######`{#`, which suggests walls. So pushing the boulder north from (38,10) to (38,9) would hit a wall at y=9, x=38. 

Therefore, pushing north is not possible. 

What about pushing south? The agent is at (37,10), boulder at (38,10). Moving south would take the agent to (37,11), and pushing the boulder to (38,11). 

Looking at the map for y=11, it's `#######..#`, which might have obstacles. The agent needs to check if (38,11) is passable. 

The language observation mentions bars very near eastnortheast, eastsoutheast, southeast, and westnorthwest. So at (38,11), there might be a bar. 

Alternatively, the agent can try pushing south. 

Since all other options are blocked, the only possible move is to push the boulder south into a clear space. 

But without knowing the exact map layout, it's hard to say. 

Given the information, the best action is to attempt to push the boulder south by moving south. 

Therefore, the chosen action is 'south'.

I need to figure out the best move here. Let me look at the current situation. The agent is at position (37, 11) facing south. The map shows some structures with bars and a boulder nearby. The goal is to push boulders onto fountains.

Looking at the language observations, there's a boulder adjacent to the east. The fountains are near northnorthwest and eastnortheast. The stairs up are very near westnorthwest, but I need to focus on pushing the boulder first.

The agent previously tried moving west, east, north, and south multiple times. The last message said ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" Wait, when did that happen? Let me check the history. Oh, right, when the agent tried to move south earlier, there was a message about failing to move the boulder. But now, the cursor is at (37, 11), and the boulder is adjacent east. 

So the boulder is to the east of the agent. To push it, the agent needs to move into it from the west. But the agent is currently at (37, 11), and the boulder is adjacent east. So if the agent moves east, they would be next to the boulder. Then, if there's space behind the boulder, the agent can push it by moving into it again. 

Looking at the map, the character at (37, 11) is '<', which is the agent. To the east (position 38, 11), there's a '{' which might be a boulder. The map line for y=11 has ""#<.{..{..#"". So the agent is at position 37 (0-based index?), so the '<' is at the 3rd character (assuming the line is ""#<.{..{..#""). Wait, the line is ""##..`.#..#"", but in the current map, the line might be different. Wait, the map provided now for y=11 is:

                                  ##########                                    
                                  ##{..##.`#                                    

Wait, no, the map entries after the cursor's position might not be fully shown. The actual map lines for the agent's current position (37,11) might have a boulder to the east. The language observation mentions a boulder adjacent east, so moving east into it and then pushing south or another direction where there's no obstacle.

The agent needs to push the boulder onto a fountain. The fountains are near northnorthwest and eastnortheast. The eastnortheast fountain is probably closer if there's a path. So the plan is: move east to the boulder, then push it south or east where there's a fountain.

But first, check if moving east is possible. The agent is at (37,11). Moving east would take them to (38,11). The observation says the boulder is adjacent east, so that position should be the boulder. To push the boulder, the agent needs to move into it, and then there must be an empty space behind it. Let's see the map again. The line for y=11 in the map is ""#<.{..{..#"". Assuming the agent is at position 37 (x=37), which is the '<' character. The next position east (x=38) is '{', which is a boulder. Behind the boulder (x=39, y=11) would be another character. If that's a '.' (floor) and there's a fountain nearby, then pushing east would be possible.

The fountains are near eastnortheast. So after pushing the boulder east, it should reach the fountain. So the steps would be: move east to the boulder, then push it east again.

But the agent's last action was south, moving to (37,11). Now, the boulder is adjacent east. So the next action should be to move east towards the boulder. Then, when adjacent, push it by moving east again.

So the chosen action would be east, then east again to push. But since the agent can only output one action at a time, the first step is to move east to get next to the boulder.

Let's see. The goal is to push the boulders onto fountains. Right now, there's a boulder at (38, 11) which I just moved east to (38, 10). Looking at the map, the cursor is at (38,11) after moving east.

Looking at the map, after pushing the boulder, the boulder is now adjacent to east. The fountains are near eastsoutheast and westnorthwest. The boulder I just moved is at (38,10), which is east of where I was. The nearest fountain is eastsoutheast. So maybe I need to push this boulder further east towards that fountain.

Wait, the current position of the boulder is adjacent to east. Let me check the observations again. The message says the boulder was moved, so it's now at (38,10), which is one step east from where I was. The fountain is southeast. So to get the boulder to the southeast fountain, I need to move it east again.

But wait, the map shows that after moving the boulder east, the cursor is now at (38,11). Wait, no, the cursor location might be the player's position. Let me check: after moving east from (37,10) to (38,10), the cursor is at (38,11)? That might be a mistake, or maybe the map update is different. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the boulder is now at (38,10), and the player is at (38,11). So the boulder is south of the player. To push it further east, the player would need to move east again, but the boulder is already there. Wait, no: when you push a boulder, you move into it, so if the boulder is at (38,10), and the player is at (38,11), moving east would take the player to (39,11), but the boulder is at (38,10). So perhaps the player is now next to the boulder.

Wait, maybe I need to check the map again. The map after moving east shows:

In the third row (y=10?), the player is at #<.{@.{..# with the boulder at position where the @ is. Wait, the map might be rotated. Let me see. The map rows are probably vertical. The player's position is (38,10), which in the map is the third row (y=10) and column 38. The '@' symbol is at position (38,10), which represents the boulder. So after pushing, the boulder is now at (38,10), and the player is at (38,11)? Or is the '@' the player?

Wait, in the initial map, the player's position is marked with '<' in the third row. After moving west several times, the player's position shifted. Now, after pushing the boulder east, the '@' symbol is where the boulder is, and the player's cursor is at (38,11), which might be a different coordinate. This is a bit confusing.

Alternatively, the '@' represents the player, and the 'O' represents the boulder. Wait, no, in standard NetHack, '@' is the player, 'O' is a boulder. But in the map provided, the boulder is represented by '@' after moving. Maybe the map uses different symbols. Let me check the initial map. In the first step, the map shows:

#<.{..@..# 

So the '@' is the boulder. When the player moves west, the '@' moves. So after pushing the boulder east, the '@' is now at (38,10), and the player is at (38,11). The cursor's position is (38,11), which is north of the boulder. To push the boulder further east, the player needs to move east into it. So the action would be 'east' again. But I need to make sure there's no obstacle behind the boulder. The observation says the boulder was moved, so the path was clear. Therefore, the next step is to move east again to push the boulder further towards the southeast fountain.

Let's see. The agent is stuck trying to move the boulder. The last few moves were trying to move east and south, but the boulder isn't moving. The message says ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" So maybe the boulder is blocked by something or there's an obstacle in the way.

Looking at the map, the agent is at (38, 11). The boulder is adjacent east. The last move was east, which probably tried to push the boulder east, but it didn't work. So maybe there's an obstacle east of the boulder. The bars and dark areas might be blocking the path.

The goal is to push the boulder onto the fountain. The fountains are near southsoutheast and westnorthwest according to previous observations. The boulder is currently near eastnortheast, southeast, and southsoutheast. So maybe the agent needs to position the boulder towards the southsoutheast fountain.

Since pushing didn't work, perhaps the agent needs to move around the boulder. Maybe go west to get a better angle. Alternatively, check if there's a clear path to push the boulder south or southeast. The bar descriptions mention bars near eastnortheast, eastsoutheast, etc., which could be walls or obstacles.

The agent is at (38,11). If the boulder is to the east at (39,11), and there's a bar or obstacle at (40,11), that would block the push. The agent could try moving south to get under the boulder and then push it east. Or maybe move west to avoid the bars and find a path.

Another possibility is that the agent needs to check the surrounding areas for clear paths. The bars mention very near northnortheast, northeast, east, etc. So moving south might lead to a clearer path. Alternatively, moving west again to get closer to the stairs up near westnorthwest, but not sure if that helps.

The inventory has a blessed potion of extra healing and other items, but those might not be needed right now. The main task is moving the boulder. Since pushing east didn't work, perhaps try a different direction. Maybe push the boulder south towards the fountain. To do that, the agent might need to move south first.

Looking at the language observation, the fountain is adjacent west. So if the boulder could be moved west, that's closer to the fountain. But the boulder is currently at (39,11) (assuming), and west would be (38,11), where the agent is. So maybe the agent needs to move west of the boulder. But how?

Alternatively, the agent could move south from (38,11) to (38,12), then try to push the boulder east. But need to check if that path is clear. The bars very near east, southsoutheast, etc., might be blocking. 

Wait, the latest observation shows the boulder adjacent east. So the agent is at (38,11), and the boulder is at (39,11). The message says the agent tried to push east but failed. So the path east from the boulder (to (40,11)) is blocked by a bar or dark area. So the agent needs to find a way around.

Possible actions: Move south to (38,12), then try to push the boulder east. Or move north to (38,10) and try pushing from another angle. Alternatively, move west to (37,11) and see if there's a way to push the boulder west towards the fountain.

The fountain is adjacent west at (38,10), but the agent is at (38,11). The boulder is at (39,11). If the agent can push the boulder west to (38,11), but the agent is already there. Maybe push it southwest to (39,12)? Not sure. The agent needs to check the map layout.

Looking at the map, there are a lot of #######`{# and similar structures, which are probably walls or obstacles. The agent is in a corridor maybe. The stairs up are near westnorthwest, which is (34,8) maybe? Not sure. The exact map structure is hard to parse, but there are a lot of barriers.

The best approach might be to move around the boulder. Since pushing east didn't work, try moving south to (38,12) and see if the path is clear. If so, then from there, push the boulder east or south. Alternatively, move west to (37,11) and check if pushing the boulder west is possible.

Another angle: The boulder needs to reach the fountain near southsoutheast. The current boulders are near eastnortheast and southsoutheast. So maybe the agent should focus on the boulder at southsoutheast. But in the last move, the agent was trying to push the one at eastnortheast. Not sure which one is the target.

The message says ""boulders near southsoutheast"", plural. So there might be multiple boulders. The agent needs to push them all to their respective fountains. But the current focus is on the one that's adjacent east.

Given that pushing east failed, the agent should try a different direction. Maybe push south. To do that, the agent needs to position themselves south of the boulder. So move south to (38,12), then try pushing south. But need to check if the path is clear.

Alternatively, move west to (37,11) and try pushing west. But the fountain is westnorthwest, so pushing west might not be the right direction. The fountain near southsoutheast is the target for that boulder.

Hmm. The agent's current position is (38,11) with a boulder at (39,11). The bars very near east, so (40,11) is blocked. The agent could try moving south to (38,12), then see if pushing the boulder east or south is possible from there.

Looking at the language observation, bars are very near northnortheast, northeast, east, etc. So moving south might lead to a clearer path. Let's try that.

The agent is in a Boxoban-like game, trying to push boulders onto fountains. The map shows several boulders and fountains in different positions. The agent's current position is (38, 11). The latest observation says there's a boulder adjacent to the east, but moving east again failed because the boulder couldn't be moved further. The message ""You cannot pass through the bars"" indicates there's a barrier blocking movement in some directions.

The goal is to push all boulders onto fountains. Looking at the language observations, there's a boulder near eastnortheast and several in the southsoutheast. The fountains are near southeast, east, and westnorthwest. The agent needs to navigate to a boulder and push it towards a fountain.

In the last few steps, the agent tried moving east and south but hit bars or couldn't move the boulder. The current position has a boulder adjacent east (x=39, y=11). To push it, the agent needs to move west towards the boulder, but recent attempts to move west didn't change the position. Wait, the agent was at x=38, y=11, and tried going east to x=39, but the boulder couldn't be moved. Maybe the boulder is stuck against a bar or another obstacle.

Looking at the map, the agent's position is marked with @, and the boulder is adjacent east. The bars are in various directions, so maybe the boulder is against a bar or the edge of the map. If the agent can't push the boulder east, perhaps moving south or north around it would be better. Alternatively, check if there's another boulder further west that needs attention.

The stairs up are nearby to the westsouthwest, but the priority is pushing boulders. The fountains near eastsoutheast and westnorthwest are targets. The agent might need to go back west to another boulder or find a path to the one adjacent east. Since moving east didn't work, maybe moving south to y=12 and then west could allow accessing the boulder from another angle. Alternatively, check if the boulder adjacent east can be pushed south into the fountain southeast.

Wait, the fountain near southeast might be reachable by pushing the boulder there. The agent's current position is (38,11). If the boulder is at (39,11), pushing it south to (39,12) could place it near the fountain. But the map shows bars in various directions; need to ensure there's no obstacle behind the boulder. If moving south is possible, that could be a way. Alternatively, move north to see if there's a path.

Another approach: since the agent is stuck trying to move the east boulder, maybe move west to x=37 and then try pushing the boulder again from the west. But the agent just came from the west (previous positions were x=37, then back to 38). Maybe the boulder is blocked by a bar or another boulder. The language observation mentions bars very near northnortheast, northeast, etc., so movement might be restricted.

Considering all this, the best immediate action might be to move south to y=12, see if there's a way to navigate around the boulder or find another path. Alternatively, move north to check for obstacles. But the message about bars suggests some directions are blocked. The agent needs to avoid bars and find a path to a boulder that can be pushed towards a fountain.

Let's see. The agent is in Boxoban, trying to push boulders onto fountains. The current position is (38,11). The map shows some bars blocking paths, and there's a boulder adjacent to the east. The message says ""You cannot pass through the bars,"" so moving south is blocked by bars.

Looking at the language observations, there's a boulder very near the south, and fountains adjacent to the west and northwest. The goal is to get the boulder onto the fountain. The agent just tried moving the boulder east twice but failed. Maybe the boulder is stuck because there's something behind it or the path is blocked.

The cursor is at (38,11), and the boulder is at (38,11) adjacent east. So the boulder is to the east of the agent. To push it, the agent needs to move into it from the west. But the agent just tried moving east and got a ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain"" message. That might mean there's an obstacle behind the boulder or the path isn't clear. 

Looking at the map, the line with the boulder is ""#<..@`#..#"". The `@` is the agent, and the boulder is next to it east. The `#` symbols are walls or bars. So the boulder is against a wall or bars to the east, making it impossible to push further. Therefore, the agent can't push the boulder east. 

The fountains are adjacent to the west and northwest. Maybe the agent should try pushing the boulder in another direction. But where? The boulder is adjacent east, and moving west isn't possible because the agent is already at x=38. The map shows that to the north, there's a `##..###..#` which might be a partition. 

Alternatively, perhaps the agent needs to move the boulder south. But the message said moving south was blocked by bars. Wait, the agent's current y is 11, and moving south would take them to y=12. The language observation mentions bars very near south, so moving south might not be possible. 

Another angle: check if there's another boulder to push. The observations mention boulders near southsoutheast and eastnortheast. Maybe the agent should move to a different position to access those boulders. However, the agent is currently stuck trying to push the eastern boulder which is blocked. 

Since pushing east isn't working, maybe the agent should try moving north to find a different path. The map's north part has `##{..##.`#`, which could be a corridor. Moving north might allow repositioning to push the boulder in a different direction. 

Alternatively, check if the boulder can be pushed west into a fountain. But the agent is already west of the boulder, and the boulder is adjacent east. So pushing west would require the agent to be to the west of the boulder, but the agent is already there. Wait, the agent is at (38,11), and the boulder is at (38,11) east. So the boulder is directly to the east. To push it west, the agent needs to move into it from the east, but the agent is already east of the boulder. Wait, no—the agent is at (38,11), and the boulder is adjacent east, so the boulder is at (39,11). To push it west, the agent needs to be at (38,11) and move east into the boulder, which would push it west to (37,11). But the agent just tried moving east and couldn't. Maybe there's a wall or bar blocking the path west of the boulder. 

Looking at the map line for y=11: ""##..@`#..#"". The `@` is at position x=38, y=11. The `#` to the east of the boulder (x=39, y=11) is a wall or bar. So the boulder can't be pushed further east because it's against a wall. Therefore, the only option is to push it north, south, or west. 

But moving north from the agent's position (38,11) would go to y=10, which is the agent's previous position. The map there is ""##..`.#..#"", so maybe there's a path. If the agent moves north, they can then attempt to push the boulder north. But first, they need to reposition. 

Alternatively, move west to x=37, y=11 and see if there's a way to push the boulder from there. But the agent was previously at x=37, y=10 and moved south. 

Wait, the agent's last successful move was pushing the boulder east, but that's now blocked. So perhaps the agent should try moving north to y=10, then see if they can push the boulder from a different angle. 

Another observation: the fountain is adjacent to the west (x=37, y=11). If the boulder could be moved to (37,11), that's where the fountain is. But the boulder is currently at (39,11). To get it to (37,11), the agent needs to push it west twice. But the first push to (38,11) is possible, but the second push to (37,11) might be blocked by bars or walls. 

Looking at the map at y=11, x=37 is a `.`, which is floor. So maybe possible. But the agent needs to be at (38,11) to push the boulder west to (37,11). However, the agent just tried moving east into the boulder and failed. Maybe there's an obstacle behind the boulder. 

Alternatively, check the inventory for tools. The agent has a blessed potion of extra healing and some food, but nothing that helps push boulders. 

Given that pushing east isn't working due to the wall, the next best move is to move north to y=10 and see if there's a way to maneuver the boulder. Alternatively, move west to x=37, y=11 and attempt to push the boulder west. 

But the agent is currently at (38,11). Moving west to x=37, y=11 would place them next to the boulder's western side. Then, pushing the boulder west to (36,11) might be possible if the path is clear. 

Looking at the map at y=11, x=36 is a `#`, which is a wall or bar. So pushing west from x=38 to x=37 would require the boulder to go to x=36, which is blocked. Therefore, that's not possible. 

So the agent's options are limited. They can either try to move north, find a different path, or see if there's another boulder to push. 

Looking at the language observations, there are boulders near eastnortheast and southsoutheast. The agent might need to move to those areas. But how? The current position is constrained by bars and walls. 

Another approach: use the stairs up near westnorthwest. Maybe going upstairs changes the level, but the agent's goal is to solve the Boxoban level, so probably needs to stay on the first level. 

Given the current situation, the best action might be to move north to y=10, reposition, and then try pushing the boulder in a different direction. Alternatively, move south if possible, but earlier attempts showed that's blocked by bars. 

The agent's previous moves were west, north, south, west, east, etc., leading to a loop. To break the loop, a different direction is needed. Moving north could be the key. 

So, the chosen action is north.

Let me try to figure out what to do next in this Boxoban level. The goal is to push all the boulders onto the fountains. Looking at the current observations, the agent is at position (38, 10). There's a boulder adjacent to the southeast, and a fountain is nearby to the west. The main challenge seems to be moving that boulder towards the fountain without getting stuck.

From the map, it looks like there are a lot of bars (walls) around, especially to the south and southsoutheast. The agent tried moving south before but got a message saying they can't pass through the bars. So, the south direction is blocked. To the east, there's another boulder, but moving east there didn't work because the boulder couldn't be moved. 

The agent's last action was north, bringing them back to (38, 10). The boulder is still adjacent to the southeast. Since the fountain is to the west, maybe pushing the boulder west towards it would help. But to do that, the agent needs to position themselves correctly. 

Looking at the language observations, there's a fountain adjacent to the west. So if the boulder can be moved west, it would reach the fountain. The agent is currently at (38,10), and the boulder is at (37,10) maybe? Wait, the cursor shows the agent's position, and the boulder adjacent southeast. Southeast of (38,10) would be (39,11). But the map shows a `@` at (38,10), and the boulder might be at (39,11) or (37,11). Not sure, but the key is to get the boulder towards the west.

The agent tried moving south and east before but faced obstacles. The bars are blocking direct paths. Maybe the best approach is to move west towards the boulder. If the agent moves west, they can then try pushing the boulder. But first, need to navigate around the bars. The stairs are up near westsouthwest, which might be a way out, but the goal is to push the boulders, not climb stairs.

Another option: the boulder adjacent southeast might be near (39,11). If the agent moves southeast, but that's blocked by bars. Alternatively, move west to (37,10) and then try pushing the boulder east? Wait, the boulder is adjacent southeast, so if the agent is at (38,10), moving west to (37,10) and then south to (37,11) might position them to push the boulder west. But there's a fountain to the west, so pushing the boulder west would place it on the fountain.

Wait, the fountain is adjacent west, so if the boulder is pushed west, it would be on the fountain. Let me check the cursor position again. The agent is at (38,10), and the boulder is adjacent southeast, which would be (39,11). So to push that boulder, the agent needs to be next to it. The agent is at (38,10), so moving east to (39,10) would put them next to the boulder's southeast position? Wait, maybe the coordinates are a bit different. Let me visualize the map.

The map shows:

At position (38,9) there's a `{.@##.`#`, and at (38,10) it's `#<.{@.{..#`. The `@` is the agent's position. The boulder is adjacent southeast, so probably at (39,11). To push it, the agent needs to be east (39,10) or south (38,11) of the boulder. But the agent is at (38,10). Moving east to (39,10) would place them next to the boulder's southeast position? Maybe not. Alternatively, moving south to (38,11) and then east. But there's a bar at (38,11) as per the map's fourth line: `##..@`#..#`, so the fourth line (y=3?) has `@` at position 38. Wait, the map might be inverted. Hmm, possibly.

Alternatively, since the boulder is adjacent southeast, the agent needs to move southeast to get next to it. But the agent is at (38,10). Moving southeast would be to (39,11), which is where the boulder is. Wait, but the boulder can't be moved if the agent is pushing it into a blocked space. The message says ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" when they tried east before. Maybe the boulder is stuck behind bars or another obstacle.

Looking at the language observation, there are bars very near northeast, east, southeast, and westnorthwest. So the path to the southeast might be blocked by bars. Therefore, pushing the boulder east or southeast is impossible. The only way is to push it west towards the fountain. But how?

The agent is at (38,10). To push the boulder west, the agent needs to be to the north or south of it. The boulder is at (39,11). So the agent could move to (39,10) and then try pushing north or south. But there's a bar at (38,11), so moving south from (38,10) to (38,11) is blocked. Therefore, the agent needs to go around the bars. Maybe move west to (37,10), then south to (37,11), then east to (38,11), but that area has bars. Alternatively, move north to (38,9), then west to (37,9), and see if there's a path.

Alternatively, the agent could try to move the other boulder near eastnortheast. But that might not be necessary. The priority is the boulder adjacent southeast. Since pushing it east or southeast is blocked, the only option is to push it west. To do that, the agent needs to get to the west side of the boulder. Maybe move west, then north or south around the bars, then push the boulder.

The agent's current position is (38,10). Let's plan a path:

1. Move west to (37,10).
2. Move south to (37,11). Check if there's a bar. The map's fifth line (y=4) is `##..###..#`, which at x=37 would be `#`, so a bar. Can't move south.
3. Move north to (37,9). The third line (y=2) is `#<.{..{..#`, so x=37 is `.` (floor). So possible.
4. From (37,9), move west to (36,9). Check map's third line: `#<.{..{..#`, so x=36 is `{`, which is a door maybe? Not sure. If it's a door, the agent can open it.
5. Once past the door, move west to (35,9), then south to (35,10), positioning to push the boulder west.

Alternatively, maybe there's a better path. The key is to get around the bars and reach the boulder's west side. Since the agent is stuck in a loop moving north and south, perhaps a different approach is needed.

Looking at the inventory, there's a potion of extra healing and some food. Not sure if useful here. The main task is box pushing. The agent needs to manipulate the boulder into the fountain. Given the barriers, the only feasible way is to push it west towards the fountain. Therefore, the agent should move towards the boulder's west side, avoiding bars, and then push it.

Since the agent is at (38,10), moving west to (37,10), then north to (37,9), west to (36,9), check if that's possible. The map's third line at (36,9) is `<`, which is the agent's starting position? Wait, no. The third line is `#<.{..{..#`, so x=37 is `<`, which is the agent's initial position. Wait, maybe the coordinates are different. This is getting confusing. Maybe I should focus on the immediate area.

The agent is at (38,10). The boulder is adjacent southeast, so at (39,11). To push it west, the agent needs to be at (39,10) or (38,11). But (38,11) is blocked by a bar. So moving east to (39,10) and then pushing west? Let's see. From (38,10), move east to (39,10). Is that possible? The map's fourth line at (39,10) is `#`, which is a bar. So can't move east there. Therefore, that's blocked.

Alternative route: Move west to (37,10), then south to (37,11) which is a bar. Can't. Move north to (37,9), then west to (36,9). The third line's (y=2) x=36 is `{`, which might be a door. If the agent opens it, then proceed west. Once past the door, move south to (36,10), then east to (37,10), and then push the boulder at (39,11) west by moving to (38,11) and pushing. But (38,11) is a bar. Hmm.

This is getting complicated. Maybe the best action is to try moving west again to (37,10) and see if there's a path. Alternatively, since the previous attempts to move south and east resulted in errors, maybe the agent should try a different direction. Wait, the stairs are up near westsouthwest. Maybe going upstairs isn't helpful right now. The priority is pushing the boulder.

Another idea: The boulder adjacent southeast might have space to the west. If the agent can maneuver around to the west side, they can push it. From (38,10), move west to (37,10), then north to (37,9), west to (36,9), then south to (36,10), east to (37,10), then south to (37,11) which is a bar. No good. Alternatively, from (36,9), move south to (36,10), then east to (37,10), then south to (37,11) blocked. Not helpful.

Alternatively, move north from (38,10) to (38,9), then west to (37,9), then north to (37,8), etc., but not sure if that leads anywhere.

Maybe the agent should try pushing the boulder in a different direction. If pushing north is blocked by bars, maybe pushing south? But the boulder is at (39,11), pushing south would take it to (39,12), which might be open. But there's no fountain there. The goal is to get it to the fountain adjacent west.

Alternatively, the agent could try to move the other boulders, but there's also a boulder near eastnortheast. Not sure. The main boulder to focus on is the one adjacent southeast.

Given the time I've spent and the previous attempts, the best next action might be to move west again to (37,10) to see if there's a path open. Alternatively, move north to (38,9) and check that area. Since the agent was previously moving in a loop north and south, maybe breaking that loop by moving west could help.

So, choosing to move west from (38,10) to (37,10) might be the next step to explore new terrain and find a way to reach the boulder's west side.

Let's try to figure out what to do next in this Boxoban game. The goal is to push all the boulders onto the fountains. From the previous actions and observations, it looks like there's a boulder adjacent to the agent's current position (x=38, y=10) to the south. The message said ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain"" when they tried moving south before, so maybe there's something blocking it. In the latest map, the agent is at (38,10), and the boulder is adjacent south. Let me check the map again.

Looking at the map from the latest observation, the agent's position is marked with @ at (38,10). The line for y=10 in the map shows `##..@`#..#`, so the boulder must be south of that. The earlier messages mentioned a boulder adjacent south. But when the agent tried moving south, they got a message that they couldn't move the boulder because it was blocked. That suggests there's another obstacle south of the boulder. Maybe another boulder or a wall/bar?

The language observation mentions bars very near various directions, including south. The bars could be obstacles that the agent can't move through. So even if the boulder is south, moving south directly might be blocked by a bar. Alternatively, the boulder is stuck because it's behind another obstacle. 

The agent's inventory has some useful items, like potions and food, but in Boxoban, you typically use movement actions to push boulders into fountains. Since the boulder adjacent south can't be moved, maybe the agent needs to move around to a different position to push it. For example, if the boulder is blocked by a bar or another boulder to the south, the agent could go around to the west or east to approach the boulder from another side.

Looking at the current position (38,10), moving west would take the agent to (37,10), which is where they were before. From there, perhaps moving south again? But the map shows that at (37,10), the tiles are `##..`.`#..#`, so maybe there's a path. Alternatively, moving north to (38,9) where the map has `##.@`.`#..#`, but that might not help. 

Another approach is to look for fountains. The observations mention fountains near southeast and westnorthwest. The agent needs to get the boulders to these fountains. The boulder at southeast might be one of the target fountains, but the current boulders are at eastnortheast and southsoutheast according to the language observation. So maybe pushing the boulder at southeast onto the fountain there. 

Wait, the latest language observation says ""boulder adjacent southeast"" but the agent is at (38,10). Moving southeast would take them to (39,11), but the map's layout shows that the area is blocked by bars and dark areas. So maybe the agent needs to find a way to navigate to where the boulders are located and push them towards the fountains.

Another thing to note is the stairs up near westnorthwest. But the goal is to push boulders, so maybe the stairs are a distraction. The agent should focus on moving the boulders onto the fountains. 

Since the agent tried moving south and couldn't, perhaps they need to move east again to get a better position. Wait, earlier attempts to move east when the boulder was adjacent south resulted in failure. Alternatively, moving west to (37,10) and then trying to go south from there. The map at (37,10) is `##..`.`#..#`, which might have a path leading south. 

Looking at the map, the agent is in a corridor that might loop. The bars and dark areas are in various directions, but there might be an open path to the west or east. The agent could try moving west again to (37,10) and then see if moving south is possible from there. Alternatively, moving north to (38,9) where there's a @, but that doesn't help. 

Another idea: check if there's a boulder that can be pushed towards a fountain. The observation mentions a boulder near eastnortheast. If the agent can move towards that boulder and push it towards the fountain in the east, that would be progress. To reach the eastnortheast boulder, the agent might need to navigate around the bars and dark areas. 

But given the agent's current position and the recent movements, perhaps the best immediate action is to try moving west again to (37,10) and then see if moving south is possible from there, avoiding the blocked path. Alternatively, move east to (38,10) and try a different direction. 

Wait, the latest cursor position is (37, y=10) after moving west. The map there shows `##..`.`#..#`, which might allow movement south. So maybe moving south from (37,10) to (37,11). Let's check if that's possible. The map for y=11 shows `##.@`#..#`, so the agent would be at (37,11), and the boulder is at (38,11). If the agent moves east from (37,11) to (38,11), they might be able to push the boulder if there's space behind it. 

But earlier attempts to move east when the boulder was at (38,11) didn't work because it was blocked. Maybe the blocking is now resolved. Alternatively, the agent needs to check if there's a clear path behind the boulder. 

In the latest observation, the message after moving east said ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" That suggests the boulder is blocked by something to the east. So perhaps the agent needs to move in a different direction to create space. 

Given the complexity, the best action might be to move west again to (37,10) and then try to find a path that leads to the boulder at eastnortheast. Alternatively, move north to check if there's an alternative route. 

Alternatively, since the agent has a potion of extra healing, maybe using an action related to that, but in Boxoban, the standard actions are movement. Using items isn't typically part of the movement-based gameplay. 

Considering all this, the next logical step is to try moving south again from (37,10) to see if the path is now clear. If the bars are still blocking, then try another direction. Alternatively, move east to (38,10) and attempt to push the boulder south again, but that might not work. 

Based on the previous attempts and the current map layout, the safest bet is to move west back to (37,10) and then attempt to move south to (37,11) where there might be a clearer path or a way to push the boulder east towards the fountain.

Let's see. The agent is trying to solve Boxoban, pushing boulders onto fountains. The current state after a series of movements shows the agent is at (37,11). The map shows several fountains and boulders. The latest message mentions a boulder very near east, so maybe the agent is next to a boulder they can push.

Looking at the map, the agent's position is marked with '@'. To the east (38,11) there's a boulder ('{'). The agent needs to push this boulder towards a fountain. The fountains are near eastnortheast and eastsoutheast, so perhaps the east direction is the way to go. 

The previous attempts to move south into bars failed, so moving south isn't helpful. The agent should try pushing the boulder east. Since the boulder is adjacent, moving east again (action 'east') should work if there's space. The message before that said ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain"" when trying to push it east earlier. Wait, maybe the agent needs to check if there's space beyond the boulder. Let me check the map again.

In the current map, at (38,11) there's a boulder '{'. If the agent moves east (to 39,11), is there a fountain there? The language observation mentions fountains very near east and eastsoutheast. So pushing the boulder east would place it adjacent to a fountain. But the agent needs to confirm if the space behind the boulder is clear. The map shows '.' which is floor, so maybe there's a path. 

The message when the agent tried to push before was ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" That might be because the boulder was already pushed earlier, or maybe there's an obstacle. Wait, looking back, after moving east twice, the agent tried to push again but failed. Maybe the boulder is stuck against another obstacle. Alternatively, perhaps the agent needs to position themselves correctly.

Alternatively, maybe the agent should move south to a different position. But the last observation says moving south hits bars. Another option is to move north, but the agent was there before. 

Wait, the latest cursor position is (37,11). The boulder is at (38,11). So the agent is west of the boulder. To push the boulder east, the agent needs to move east into the boulder's space. The action would be 'east', which would attempt to push the boulder. But earlier attempts resulted in ""in vain"", which might mean the boulder can't be moved there. Maybe there's a wall or another obstacle behind the boulder. 

Looking at the map, the line for row 11 (assuming y=11 is the 11th row down) has ""#<.{..{..#"". At position (38,11), the character is '{', which is a boulder. The next position east (39,11) is a '.' which is floor. So there should be space to push the boulder east. But why did previous attempts fail? Maybe the agent was not adjacent enough or there's another factor. 

Wait, in Boxoban, you can only push a boulder if the space behind it is empty. So if the agent is at (37,11) and the boulder is at (38,11), moving east would push the boulder to (39,11). Since (39,11) is a floor, it should work. The previous message said ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain"" perhaps because of a typo or misunderstanding. Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to try again. 

Given the current state, the best action is to try pushing the boulder east again. So the chosen action is 'east'.

",-0.001,False
64,north,"<reasoning>
Let me try to figure out what to do here. The agent is in Boxoban, a Boulder-d pushing game. The goal is to push all boulders onto fountains. Let me check the current state.

Looking at the map, the agent (marked as @) is at position (38, 11). There's a boulder adjacent to the east (since the last message mentioned trying to move the boulder but failing). The fountains are nearby, maybe to the northwest and eastsoutheast. The stairs up are westnorthwest, so maybe the exit is up there once boulders are placed.

The recent actions were a series of moving east, west, north, south, trying to push the boulder but failing. The last successful push was moving the boulder east, but when trying again, it said ""in vain,"" meaning there's something blocking it now, like another obstacle or a wall.

The language observations mention bars very near to the east, southeast, south, etc. Bars are probably walls or obstacles. The boulder is adjacent east, so trying to push it further east is blocked. The fountains are adjacent west, so maybe one boulder is already on a fountain? Wait, the message when pushing the boulder said ""With great effort you move the boulder."" So that boulder was moved to east, but now it's stuck because the next tile is a bar or another obstacle.

Current plan: Need to navigate to the boulder that's been pushed east and see if it's on a fountain. If not, maybe need to move it further. Alternatively, check other boulders. The language observation mentions boulders near eastnortheast and southsoutheast. Maybe there are multiple boulders to push.

Wait, the cursor is at (38,11), and the boulder is adjacent east. So the boulder is at (39,11). The fountain is adjacent west, which would be (38,11)'s west, so (37,11). But the boulder is at (39,11), so unless the fountain is at (39,11), which isn't indicated. The fountains are mentioned as very near east and westnorthwest. Maybe there's a fountain to the east of the agent's current position.

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to move around to the east to check where the boulder is. But the bars are blocking movement south. The latest message said ""You cannot pass through the bars"" when trying to move south. So the agent is next to a bar to the south.

Possible steps:
1. Try to move east again to interact with the boulder. But the last attempt failed, so maybe there's a bar or another boulder in the way.
2. Move north or west to find a different path to reach other boulders.
3. Check if any boulders are already on fountains. If so, the level might be solved.

Looking at the map, the agent is at position (38,11). The map shows some structure with # symbols (walls) and ` symbols maybe as floor. The boulder is at (39,11), and the fountain is adjacent west (37,11). Wait, the fountain adjacent west would be (37,11), but the agent is at (38,11). So the fountain is one tile west of the agent. Maybe the boulder needs to be pushed to (37,11) to be on the fountain.

But the boulder is at (39,11), so to push it to (37,11), the agent would need to go around. However, moving west from (38,11) would take the agent to (37,11), which is the fountain. But the boulder is at (39,11), so the agent could push it west through (38,11) and then to (37,11). But the agent is already at (38,11), and the boulder is east. So the agent needs to move east to (39,11) to push it west.

But earlier attempts to move east resulted in the message ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" Which implies that there's something blocking the boulder's path east. Maybe a bar or another obstacle.

Looking at the map, the agent's current position (38,11) has a ` symbol, which might be floor. The next tile east (39,11) is where the boulder is. The tile beyond that (40,11) might be a bar or wall. If that's the case, the boulder cannot be pushed further east.

So maybe the agent should try to move the boulder in another direction. Since the boulder is at (39,11), the agent is at (38,11). To push the boulder north, the agent would move north to (38,10) and then push north. But the boulder's current position is east of the agent, so the agent needs to be adjacent to it to push.

Wait, the agent is at (38,11), and the boulder is adjacent east at (39,11). To push the boulder west, the agent would move west into the boulder's tile, which would push it west to (38,11) (the agent's current position), but that's occupied. Wait, no. When you push a boulder, you move into it, and it moves in the direction you're coming from. So if the agent is at (38,11) and the boulder is at (39,11), to push the boulder west, the agent needs to move west into (38,11), but that's where the agent is. Wait, no. Let me clarify:

To push a boulder to the west, the agent needs to move west into the boulder's tile. So the agent is at (38,11), moves west to (37,11), but the boulder is at (39,11). That doesn't help. Alternatively, the agent needs to be next to the boulder and move in the direction opposite to where they want the boulder to go. For example, to push the boulder west, the agent should be to the east of the boulder and move west into it, which would push the boulder west.

But the agent is already to the west of the boulder. Wait, the agent is at (38,11), boulder at (39,11). So the agent is west of the boulder. To push the boulder west, the agent needs to move west into the boulder's tile. But that's not possible because the agent is already at (38,11), and the boulder is at (39,11). So the agent would have to move west into (38,11), which is occupied by the agent itself. That doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe I got the directions mixed up. In the game, to push a boulder north, you move north into it, which pushes it north. So if the agent is south of the boulder and moves north into it, the boulder moves north.

In this case, the agent is at (38,11), boulder at (39,11). So the agent is west of the boulder. To push the boulder west, the agent needs to be to the east of the boulder and move west into it. But the agent is west, so they can't do that. Therefore, the agent can't push the boulder west from their current position. They would need to move east to be adjacent to the boulder, then push it in a direction.

But earlier attempts to move east resulted in the message ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" Which suggests that moving east from (38,11) into (39,11) (where the boulder is) is not possible, perhaps because the next tile after the boulder is blocked.

So maybe the path east of the boulder is blocked by a bar or wall. Let's check the map again. The map shows at position (39,11) the boulder, and beyond that (40,11), perhaps a bar or wall. If that's the case, the boulder can't be pushed further east.

In that case, the agent should try to push the boulder in another direction. Since the agent is at (38,11), they can try to push the boulder north or south.

Looking at the language observation, bars are very near south, southeast, etc. The agent's current position has bars adjacent southeast and south. So moving south from (38,11) is blocked by bars. Moving north to (38,10) might be possible if there's no obstacle.

Looking at the map, the agent's current position (38,11) has a ` symbol, and the tile north (38,10) has a ` as well. The boulder is at (39,11). So if the agent moves north to (38,10), then tries to push the boulder north, that might work.

Wait, but to push the boulder north, the agent needs to be south of it. The boulder is at (39,11), so the agent would need to be at (39,11) to push it north. But the agent is at (38,11). So perhaps the agent should move east to (39,11) first, then push north. But moving east there failed before.

Alternatively, maybe the agent can move north, then east, then push north. Let me think.

Another approach: Check if any boulders are already on fountains. The language observation mentions fountains adjacent west (which is the agent's current position's west, (37,11)), so maybe the fountain is there. If the boulder was pushed to (37,11), that would be on the fountain. But the boulder is at (39,11), so unless there's a fountain further east, which isn't indicated.

Alternatively, the other boulders mentioned (near eastnortheast and southsoutheast) might need to be pushed onto their respective fountains. The agent might need to navigate to those areas.

But given the current position and the recent movements, the agent is stuck trying to push the eastern boulder. Maybe the best move is to backtrack and try a different path. For example, move west to (37,11), check the fountain there, and see if the boulder can be repositioned.

Alternatively, since the agent can't push the boulder east, maybe try pushing it west into the fountain at (37,11). But the agent is at (38,11), so to push the boulder west, they would need to move west into it. But the boulder is at (39,11), so the agent would have to move west to (38,11) (their current position), which isn't helpful. Wait, no. To push the boulder west, the agent needs to be to the east of the boulder and move west into it. So the agent needs to be at (39,11) (east of the boulder at (40,11)), but the boulder is at (39,11), so that's not possible. This is getting confusing.

Maybe the agent should move north to (38,10) and then try to move east towards the boulder, but given the previous failure, perhaps there's a bar in the way. Alternatively, check the map again for clues.

The map shows at position (38,11) as `., which might be a floor with something. The boulder is at (39,11) marked with @. The tiles beyond that might be bars. So pushing the boulder further east is impossible. Therefore, the agent should look for another boulder or try to push this one in a different direction, like north or south.

Moving north from (38,11) to (38,10) is possible if there's no obstacle. The language observation mentions bars very near south, so north might be clear. If the agent moves north, they can then try to move east around the boulder or find another path.

Alternatively, since the agent's goal is to get all boulders on fountains, maybe the current boulder doesn't need to be moved further east, but another boulder in the southsoutheast needs attention. The agent might need to navigate to that area.

But given the agent's current position and the recent movements, the most immediate action is to try to push the boulder in a possible direction. Since pushing east is blocked, try pushing north. To do that, the agent needs to be south of the boulder. Since the agent is west of the boulder, they would need to move east first, but that's blocked. So this seems impossible.

Wait, perhaps the agent can move north, then east, then push north. Let's see:

1. Agent is at (38,11).
2. Move north to (38,10).
3. Move east to (39,10).
4. Then push the boulder at (39,11) north to (40,11), if possible.

But the language observation says bars are very near south, so maybe moving north is clear. The map shows at (38,10) a ` symbol, which is floor. So moving north is possible.

After moving north to (38,10), the agent can then move east to (39,10), then try to push the boulder at (39,11) north to (40,11). If that's possible, then the boulder moves north, possibly away from obstacles.

Alternatively, maybe the agent should check the other boulder near southsoutheast. The language observation mentions boulders there. The agent might need to go there and push that one onto the fountain.

But navigating to the southsoutheast area might require moving in that direction, but there are bars blocking south movement. The agent previously got a message ""You cannot pass through the bars"" when moving south. So south is blocked.

Hmm. This is tricky. The agent seems stuck with the current boulder. Maybe the solution is to move around to the other side of the map and address the other boulders.

Alternatively, the agent could try to use a different action, like using an item. The inventory has potions, scrolls, etc. But using a potion of extra healing might not help here; the goal is to push boulders.

Another thought: The stairs up are near westnorthwest. Maybe once all boulders are on fountains, the agent can use the stairs to exit. But right now, the agent needs to place the boulders.

Given the current state, the best actionable step is to attempt to push the boulder in a possible direction. Since pushing east is blocked, try moving north, then see if the boulder can be pushed north from there.

So the next action could be to move north to (38,10), then east to (39,10), then try pushing the boulder north to (40,11). But since the agent can only take one action at a time, the first step is to move north.

Alternatively, since the agent is at (38,11) and the boulder is at (39,11), maybe moving west into the boulder isn't possible, but moving north and then east might open up a path.

Another possibility: The agent could move west to (37,11), which is adjacent to the fountain. Maybe there's a way to push the boulder from there, but the boulder is currently at (39,11), so that's two tiles away.

I think the most immediate action is to move north to (38,10) to see if that's clear and then plan the next moves from there.

65,push west,"<reasoning>
I need to figure out how to push the boulder onto the fountain in this Boxoban-like game. Let's start by analyzing the current observations.

Looking at the map, the agent is at position (38, 10). There's a boulder nearby (marked with a @ symbol) to the east. The stomach of the map shows several fountains, one adjacent to the west. The bars are blocking some paths, especially to the south and southsoutheast.

The goal is to push the boulder onto the fountain. Since the boulder is to the east, maybe moving east first would help. But earlier attempts to push it resulted in failure, possibly because there's an obstacle behind it. Let me check the latest observation after moving east. The message said ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" So maybe there's something blocking the boulder's path when trying to push it east.

Looking at the map again, after moving east to (38,11), the boulder is at (38,11), and pushing it further east might be obstructed by bars or other objects. The bars are very near the east direction, so perhaps the boulder can't be pushed past them. That makes sense why moving it east didn't work.

Next, maybe I should try moving the boulder south. But the agent is currently at (38,10), and moving south would take them to (38,11), which is where the boulder is. Wait, no—the agent's position is (38,10), and the boulder is at (38,11) according to the map. So the agent is north of the boulder. To push the boulder south, the agent needs to move into the boulder's position and then push it south.

But earlier attempts to move south from (38,10) resulted in a message about bars blocking, which might be the bars mentioned in the language observation. Let me check the language observation again. It says there are bars very near northnortheast, northeast, east, etc. So moving south from (38,10) might be blocked by bars. Therefore, pushing the boulder south isn't feasible directly.

Alternative approach: Move around the boulder to a position where it can be pushed onto the fountain. The fountain adjacent to the west is at (37,10) maybe? Or perhaps another fountain to the southeast. Wait, the fountain very near east and westnorthwest. The agent's current position is (38,10). The fountain adjacent to the west would be at (37,10), which is where the agent was before moving east. Maybe pushing the boulder west towards that fountain?

But the boulder is at (38,11) when the agent is at (38,10). To push it west, the agent needs to be next to it. So the agent should move east to (38,11) to be adjacent, then push west. However, trying to move east again resulted in the boulder not moving because of an obstacle. Let me check the latest map. The map shows at position (38,11) there's a `@` which is the boulder, and the agent is at (38,10) with `@.` indicating the boulder's position. The cell to the west of the boulder (37,11) might be blocked by bars or another obstacle.

Looking at the language observation, there are bars adjacent to the southeast and south of the boulder. So if the boulder is at (38,11), pushing it west would require the path to be clear. But the bars adjacent to the southeast (of the boulder) might be in (39,12) or similar, which could block the path west. Alternatively, maybe the bars are in the way when trying to push the boulder west.

Another possibility is that the agent should move the boulder north. But the agent is already north of the boulder. Pushing it north would require the boulder to move into a cell that's not blocked. The north direction from the boulder's position (38,11) might be blocked by walls or bars.

Wait, the stairs up are near westnorthwest, which is probably at a different coordinate. Maybe the agent needs to reposition to get a better angle on the boulder. Let's think about the cursor position and the map layout. The agent is at (38,10), and the boulder is at (38,11). To push the boulder west, the agent needs to move east to (38,11), then push west to (37,11). If that cell is clear, then the boulder can be moved there. But according to previous observations, moving the boulder east didn't work because of an obstacle. Maybe the obstacle is in (38,12) or (39,11), which would block pushing the boulder west.

Alternatively, maybe the boulder is stuck because there's a bar behind it when trying to push. The agent needs to find a way to position the boulder so that there's no obstacle behind it. Perhaps moving the agent in a different direction to create space.

Another angle: The fountain adjacent to the west is at (37,10). The agent is currently at (38,10). If the boulder could be moved west to (37,10), that would place it on the fountain. To do that, the agent needs to be at (38,10) (current position), move east to (38,11) to be next to the boulder, then push west to (37,11). But if (37,11) is blocked by bars or another boulder, that won't work. The language observation mentions bars adjacent to the southeast and south of the boulder, so maybe (39,11) or (38,12) has bars, blocking the path west.

In the latest observation, the message when trying to push east was ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" Which implies there's an obstacle behind the boulder when pushing east. That obstacle could be a bar or another boulder. If the boulder is blocked when pushing east, perhaps the same obstacle is also blocking pushing west.

Wait, maybe the boulder is in a corridor where it can't be moved in any direction except north or south, but those directions are also blocked. Alternatively, the agent needs to find a way to move around the boulder to a different side where it can be pushed onto the fountain.

Given that the agent is at (38,10) and the boulder is at (38,11), perhaps moving the agent south to (38,11) and then trying to push the boulder west. But moving south from (38,10) to (38,11) is where the boulder is. So the agent would be adjacent to the boulder there. Then, trying to push west would require checking if the cell (37,11) is clear. If it's blocked by bars, then pushing won't work.

The language observation says bars are adjacent southeast and south of the boulder. So, the cell to the southeast of the boulder (39,12) and south (38,12) might have bars. That would block pushing the boulder west towards (37,11) because the path would be clear west from (38,11) to (37,11), but if the bars are further south or southeast, they might not interfere. Hmm, maybe the bars are in the way of other directions.

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to move north to create space. But the agent is already north of the boulder. Another approach: Use the inventory to see if there's anything helpful. The inventory has a blessed potion of extra healing, scrolls, food, etc., but nothing that directly affects the environment. Maybe using a scroll of magic mapping could reveal more of the map, but the agent's previous actions haven't done that yet.

Considering all this, the most plausible action is to try pushing the boulder west again, even if it failed before, maybe in a different position. Alternatively, check if there's another boulder that needs to be moved first, but the current observations show only one boulder nearby.

Wait, the language observation mentions ""boulders near southsoutheast"" in addition to the one near east. Maybe there are multiple boulders, and the agent needs to handle them all. But the immediate goal is to push the one adjacent to the agent onto the fountain.

Another thought: The stairs up are near westnorthwest, which might be a way to escape, but the goal is to push the boulder onto the fountain, not to climb stairs. So ignoring that for now.

Given the agent's current position and the boulder's location, the next logical step is to attempt to push the boulder west again, even if it failed before. Maybe the previous attempts were due to a specific obstacle that can be overcome by repositioning.

Alternatively, move the agent to the west of the boulder and try pushing it east towards the fountain. But the agent is currently east of the boulder. To get west of it, the agent would need to move west from (38,10) to (37,10), then north to (37,11), positioning themselves west of the boulder. Then push east. But is (37,11) clear?

Looking at the map, the cell (37,11) is shown as `@` which is the boulder. Wait, no—the map at (38,11) is `@` for the boulder. The agent is at (38,10). The cell (37,11) would be west of the boulder. If that cell is blocked by bars, then the agent can't move there. The language observation mentions bars adjacent to the southeast and south of the boulder, which might affect cells like (39,11) and (38,12). So (37,11) might be clear.

If the agent moves west to (37,10), then north to (37,11), they would be west of the boulder. Then, pushing east into the boulder towards the fountain at (37,10) (which is the western fountain). But the agent needs to check if (37,11) is clear.

In the current map, the cell (37,11) is part of the dungeon layout. The map shows `##..@`#..#` at row 4, which might correspond to different positions. It's a bit unclear without a visual map, but based on the coordinates, the agent needs to navigate carefully.

Another possibility is that the boulder is stuck between bars and can't be moved in any direction except perhaps north. If that's the case, the agent might need to find another boulder to move first. But the observations mention multiple boulders, so maybe focusing on another one.

However, the immediate goal is the boulder near east. Given the previous attempts and the lack of progress, perhaps the agent should try a different approach. Maybe moving around to the north of the boulder and pushing it south onto the fountain. But the agent is already north of the boulder, and pushing south would require the path to be clear. The language observation mentions bars very near the south, so that might block pushing the boulder south.

Alternatively, use the agent's ability to move around and find a way to position the boulder correctly. Since the agent moved south earlier and hit bars, maybe moving north past the boulder and then pushing it south.

Wait, the agent is at (38,10), the boulder is at (38,11). If the agent moves north to (38,9), but that's not possible since the map's layout shows the agent is near the bottom. The map's rows might be inverted, with y=9 being higher up. So moving north from (38,10) would take the agent to (38,9), which might be a valid cell. Checking the map, the row for y=9 has `##..`.@`#..#`, so the agent is at (38,10) which is the position of the `@` (boulder). Wait, maybe there's confusion in the map coordinates. The agent's cursor is at (x=38, y=10), and the map's rows are listed from top to bottom. So y=9 is the top row, and y=11 is lower down. The boulder is at (38,11) in the map's display, which would be the 11th row from the top. But the agent's current position is (38,10), which is the 10th row.

In any case, the boulder is directly south of the agent. To push it south, the agent needs to be adjacent and push. But the previous attempt to move south resulted in a message about bars blocking. The language observation says ""You cannot pass through the bars,"" which might be in the cell south of the boulder. So pushing the boulder south would require the path to be clear beyond the boulder. If there are bars south of the boulder's new position, it can't be moved there.

Given all this, the most feasible action might be to try pushing the boulder west again, even if it failed before, in case there was a temporary obstacle or a different path. Alternatively, check if moving the agent to the west of the boulder and then pushing east towards the western fountain is possible.

Another angle: The fountain adjacent to the west is at (37,10). If the boulder could be moved to (37,10), that would solve the problem. To do that, the agent needs to position the boulder there. The agent is currently at (38,10). Moving west to (37,10), then north to (37,11), which is where the boulder is. Then push west from (37,11) to (36,11), but that might not reach the fountain. Alternatively, push the boulder north from (38,11) to (38,10), but the agent is already there.

This is getting a bit confusing. Maybe the best course of action is to attempt to push the boulder west again, as that's the direction towards the western fountain. Even if it failed before, perhaps the agent wasn't positioned correctly. Alternatively, move the agent to the west of the boulder and try pushing it east.

In the latest observation, after moving east to (38,11), the boulder is there, and pushing east didn't work. So maybe moving the agent to the west of the boulder and then pushing east. To do that, the agent needs to move west from (38,10) to (37,10), then north to (37,11), which is the boulder's position. Then, push east into the boulder towards (38,11), but that's where the agent is. Hmm, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, after moving to (37,11) beside the boulder, push east to (38,11), but that's where the agent is. Maybe the agent needs to push the boulder further east beyond (38,11), but that's blocked by bars.

Given the time I've spent analyzing and the lack of progress, I think the best next action is to try pushing the boulder west again, even if it didn't work before, just to see if there's a different outcome. Alternatively, move the agent in a different direction to find a clear path.

",-0.001,False
66,push west,"<reasoning>
The agent is stuck trying to move the boulder. The previous attempts to push it resulted in failure messages. Let me look at the current observation to figure out the best move.

The cursor is at (38,9). The map shows a boulder at (38,10) since the last push attempt was towards west, but the boulder didn't move. The message when trying to push west says ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" That's probably because there's something blocking its path behind it. The boulder must be against a wall or another obstacle.

The goal is to push the boulders onto fountains. Looking at the language observation, there's a fountain adjacent to west (so at (38,8)), and another fountain very near eastsoutheast. The boulder is currently adjacent south, so maybe moving it towards the fountain to the west would be helpful.

Wait, the cursor is at (38,9) now after moving north. The boulder is at (38,10), adjacent south. So the agent needs to position themselves to push the boulder south towards the fountain at west (which is (38,8)). But the agent is at (38,9). If the agent moves south to (38,10), then they can try pushing the boulder west again. But maybe the boulder is against a bar or wall to the west. The observation mentions bars very near eastnortheast, east, southeast, and westnorthwest. So the west side might have bars blocking the boulder's path.

Alternatively, the agent could try pushing the boulder to the east first, away from the bars, then move it west. But looking at the map, east of the boulder there's a bar adjacent southeast. Maybe moving the boulder east would clear the path for moving it west later.

Wait, the boulder is at (38,10), adjacent south. The agent is at (38,9). If the agent moves south to (38,10), then they can try pushing west again. But the previous attempt failed. Maybe there's an obstacle behind the boulder. The bars are in various directions, so perhaps the boulder is stuck against a bar or another object.

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to move the boulder north first. But the agent is already north of the boulder. If the boulder is at (38,10), and the agent is at (38,9), pushing north would require the agent to be on the same spot as the boulder. Wait, no. To push a boulder, the agent needs to be adjacent and move in the direction opposite to where they want to push. So if the agent is south of the boulder (at (38,9) and boulder at (38,10)), they can push it north by moving north. But the agent is already north of the boulder. Wait, no. If the agent is at (38,9), the boulder is at (38,10). To push the boulder north, the agent would need to be north of it, but the agent is already there. That doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm confused.

Wait, movement directions: if the agent is at (x, y) and wants to push a boulder to the south, they need to move south into the boulder's position, causing it to move further south. So in this case, the agent is at (38,9), and the boulder is at (38,10). If the agent moves south to (38,10), they can then try pushing the boulder west. But the previous attempt to push west from (38,10) didn't work. Maybe because there's a bar or wall west of the boulder. Looking at the language observation, bars are adjacent north, northeast, east, and northwest of the agent's current position (38,9). So west of the agent is (38,8), which is adjacent to a fountain. If the boulder is at (38,10), pushing it west would take it to (38,9), but the agent is already there. That can't be right. Wait, maybe the boulder is at (38,10), and pushing west would move it to (38,9), which is occupied by the agent. That's not possible. So perhaps the agent needs to move out of the way first.

Wait, the agent is at (38,9). The boulder is at (38,10). To push the boulder west, the agent needs to be adjacent to it. So the agent is south of the boulder. To push it west, the agent would move west, but that would take them to (37,9), allowing the boulder to move west to (38,9), which is where the agent is. That's a problem. So maybe the agent needs to move north first, then position themselves to the west of the boulder.

Alternatively, the agent could move east to (39,9), then push the boulder west from there. But looking at the map, east of (38,9) there might be obstacles. The language observation mentions bars adjacent east. So moving east could be blocked.

Another approach: check the fountain locations. The fountain adjacent to west (so (38,8)), and another very near eastsoutheast. The boulder at (38,10) is south of the agent. If the agent can push the boulder to the west towards the fountain at (38,8), that would solve the problem. But the agent is at (38,9), so to push the boulder west, they need to be to the east of the boulder. Wait, no. If the agent is south of the boulder (at (38,9) and boulder at (38,10)), to push the boulder west, the agent would need to move west into the boulder's position, causing it to move west. But the agent is already south. So maybe the agent needs to move west to (37,9), then push the boulder south-west? No, directions are north, south, east, west. To push the boulder west, the agent must move west, which would take them to (37,9), allowing the boulder to move west to (38,9), but the agent is there. That's a conflict.

Alternatively, the agent could move north to (38,10) and then try pushing west again. But when they tried that before, it didn't work. Maybe there's a bar west of the boulder. The language observation says bars are adjacent north, northeast, east, and northwest of the agent's current position (38,9). So west of the agent is (38,8), which has a fountain. If the boulder is at (38,10), pushing west would take it to (38,9) (agent's position) or (38,8) (fountain). But the agent can't be in the same space as the boulder. So perhaps the boulder can be pushed to (38,8) onto the fountain. But how?

Wait, if the agent moves north to (38,10), then pushes west, the boulder would move to (38,9), which is occupied by the agent. That's not allowed. So the agent needs to move out of the way first. Maybe move west to (37,9), then from there push the boulder south-west? But directions are only north, south, east, west. So from (37,9), pushing the boulder west would take it to (37,8), but is there a fountain there? Not that I see. The fountain is at (38,8). Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to move the boulder to the east first. But east is blocked by bars. So perhaps the only way is to find a path around the bars. But given the current layout, the agent is stuck.

Wait, the agent's inventory has a blessed potion of extra healing and other items, but those aren't useful for moving boulders. The key is to push the boulder using movement actions.

Another idea: check if the boulder is blocked by a bar. The language observation says bars are very near eastnortheast, east, southeast, and westnorthwest. If the boulder is at (38,10) and pushing west is blocked by a bar at (38,8), then the agent can't move it west. In that case, maybe push the boulder south to (38,11), then west. But looking at the map, south of (38,10) there's a bar very near southsoutheast, south, etc. So pushing south might be blocked.

Alternatively, the agent could try pushing the boulder north. From (38,10), pushing north would take it to (38,9), which is where the agent is. Not possible. So maybe the agent needs to move north to (38,10), then push north into a different direction. Wait, no. The agent is already at (38,9), and the boulder is at (38,10). To push the boulder north, the agent would have to be north of it, but they're already adjacent. This is confusing.

Perhaps the agent's best bet is to continue trying to push the boulder west, even if it's not working, but the game message says it's impossible. Maybe there's a different approach. Let me check the map again. The map shows some structures with '#' which are probably walls or obstacles. The agent is near a staircase up at westnorthwest, but the boulders need to get to the fountains.

Wait, the fountain is adjacent west at (38,8). If the boulder could be moved there, that would solve the problem. But how? The agent is at (38,9), boulder at (38,10). To get the boulder to (38,8), the agent would need to push it west twice. But each push requires the agent to be adjacent. First, push from (38,10) to (38,9), but the agent is there. So the agent needs to move out of the way. Maybe move west to (37,9), then push the boulder west from (38,10) to (38,9), but the agent is now at (37,9). Then the boulder would be at (38,9), and the agent can move to (38,9) and push again west to (38,8). But is that possible?

Let's outline the steps:
1. Agent is at (38,9).
2. Move west to (37,9).
3. Agent is now at (37,9), boulder at (38,10).
4. Move south to (38,10) to be adjacent to the boulder.
5. Push west to (38,9), moving the boulder to (38,9). But the agent is at (37,9), so this should work.
6. Now the agent is at (38,10) (after moving south), pushes west to (38,9), boulder moves to (38,9).
7. Then agent moves to (38,9), pushes west to (38,8) onto the fountain.

But this requires multiple steps and avoiding obstacles. Let's see if the path is clear.

From (38,9) to (37,9): is there a bar? The language observation says bars are adjacent north, northeast, east, and northwest of (38,9). So west of (38,9) is (38,8), which has a fountain. East is (39,9), which has bars. So moving west to (37,9) should be possible if there's no obstacle. The map shows ########## around, but the exact path isn't clear. However, the agent has to navigate carefully.

Alternatively, maybe the agent should try pushing the boulder east first. From (38,10), pushing east would take it to (39,10). But east is blocked by bars. So that's not possible.

Another possibility: the agent needs to move the boulder to the eastsoutheast fountain. But that's further away.

Given the current observations, the most viable option seems to be pushing the boulder west towards the fountain at (38,8). To do that, the agent needs to position themselves correctly, avoiding bars and the staircase.

So the next action would be to move west to (37,9), then move south to (38,9), then push west. But the agent's current position is (38,9), and the boulder is at (38,10). So first, move south to (38,10), then push west. But the previous attempt to push west from there failed. Why? Possibly because there's a bar at (38,8) blocking the path. The language observation says bars are adjacent northwest of the agent's current position (38,9), which would be (38,8). So the boulder is trying to move into (38,8), which is blocked by a bar. Thus, the agent can't push the boulder west.

In that case, the agent needs to find another way to move the boulder. Maybe push it south first. From (38,10), pushing south to (38,11). Is that possible? The language observation mentions bars very near southsoutheast, south, and southwest. So south of (38,10) is (38,11), which might be blocked by bars. If pushing south is possible, then the agent could move the boulder to a different position and try again.

Alternatively, check if there's a clear path to the eastsoutheast fountain. The boulder at (38,10) could be pushed east, but east is blocked by bars. So probably not.

Given all this, the only possible action that might work is to continue trying to push the boulder west, even though it's failing, but perhaps there's a different blockage. Alternatively, the agent might need to use a different strategy, like moving around the boulder to push it from another direction.

Wait, the agent is at (38,9), boulder at (38,10). If the agent moves north to (38,10), then tries pushing west, but that position is already the boulder. So maybe the agent needs to move west first to (37,9), then from there push the boulder south-west? No, directions are only north, south, east, west. So from (37,9), pushing the boulder west would take it to (37,8), but there's no fountain there. The fountain is at (38,8).

This is tricky. Given the current information, the most logical next step is to try pushing the boulder west again, even if it failed before, perhaps there was a mistake in the observation. Alternatively, move the agent to a different position to find a clear path.

But according to the latest observation, after moving north to (38,9), the boulder is at (38,10), and pushing west results in a message saying ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" The reason is likely that the path is blocked by a bar at (38,8). So the agent can't push the boulder west into that bar.

In that case, the only option is to push the boulder in another direction if possible. Since pushing north is blocked by the agent's own position, pushing south might be possible if there's no barrier. The agent could try pushing the boulder south to (38,11). Let's see if that's possible.

Looking at the language observation, bars are very near southsoutheast, south, and southwest. So south of the boulder (38,10) is (38,11), which might be blocked by bars. If there's a bar there, pushing south won't work. If not, the boulder could move there.

Assuming there's no bar, the agent could move to (38,10), push south. But the previous message when trying to push west indicates a blockage, but pushing south might be different.

Alternatively, the agent could move east to (39,9), then push the boulder west. But east is blocked by bars, so that's not possible.

Given all this, the best action might be to continue trying to push the boulder west, even though it's not working, but perhaps there was a temporary blockage. Alternatively, the agent should find another boulder to push, but in the current observation, there's only one boulder near eastnortheast.

Wait, the language observation mentions ""boulders near southsoutheast"". So maybe there are multiple boulders. The agent needs to push both onto fountains. But in the current map, the agent is focused on the boulder at (38,10). The other boulders are at southsoutheast, which is further away.

Given the time I've spent on this, I'll conclude that the agent should try pushing the boulder west again, possibly from a different position. The correct action is to move the agent to (38,10) and push west, even if it fails, or find a way around.

67,Failed to obtain a valid action from the reasoning.,"<reasoning>
Let's try to figure out how to solve this Boxoban puzzle. The goal is to push all the boulders onto the fountains. Let me look at the current state based on the observations and map provided.

First, the agent is at position (38, 10) according to the last observation. The map shows some structures with bars and fountains. There's a boulder adjacent to the southeast, and fountains near the northwest and east. The message history indicates some failed attempts to move boulders, probably because they were blocked by bars or other obstacles.

Looking at the latest map, the agent is facing a situation where moving south or east is blocked by bars. The stairs up are very near westnorthwest, which might be a way out once the boulders are positioned, but right now the priority is to get the boulder onto the fountain.

The boulder is at (38,11) according to the previous observations. The fountain is adjacent to the northwest, which is at (37,10). So maybe the agent needs to position itself to push the boulder northwest towards the fountain.

Wait, the last move was north, which brought the agent to (38,9). Now, if the boulder is southwest of the agent, perhaps moving west and then pushing north or west could help. But the bars are in the way. Alternatively, maybe the agent should move west to get closer to the boulder and then push it north towards the fountain.

Looking at the language observations, there's a boulder adjacent southeast. So the boulder is to the southeast of the agent's current position (38,9). To push it, the agent needs to move into it from the west or north. But moving west from (38,9) would take the agent to (37,9), and if the boulder is at (38,10), then pushing west would move it to (37,10), which is the fountain's position. That could work.

So the plan is: move west from (38,9) to (37,9), then push the boulder west to (37,10), which is the fountain. Let me check if that's possible. The bars are near eastnortheast and other areas, but the path west from (38,9) seems clear except for the bars very near eastnortheast, east, etc., which might not be in the direct path. The agent needs to go west, then push the boulder west.

Alternatively, if moving north isn't blocked, maybe go north to position better. But the previous attempt to move north resulted in a default action due to invalid input. Wait, the user tried ""push west"" but that wasn't a valid action, so the system defaulted to north. Now the agent is at (38,9) and needs to find a valid action.

So the correct action here would be to move west to get next to the boulder, then push it west towards the fountain. Since the boulder is adjacent southeast, moving west would allow the agent to face it and push. Let's confirm the positions:

Agent is at (38,9). The boulder is at (38,10) (adjacent southeast). Wait, no—adjacent southeast would be one cell southeast. So from (38,9), southeast is (39,10). But the boulder is adjacent southeast, meaning it's at (39,10). To push it west, the agent needs to be to the north or east of the boulder. Wait, no—pushing a boulder requires the agent to move into it, which would push the boulder in the direction the agent is coming from.

So if the boulder is at (39,10) (southeast of agent at (38,9)), then the agent needs to be to the north (38,10) or west (37,9) to push it. But the agent is at (38,9). To get north to (38,10), but that cell might be blocked by bars. Looking at the map, the cell at (38,10) has a `#` which could be a wall or bar. The map shows:

At position (38,10), the map cell is `.` (floor) according to the last map. Wait, the map display is a bit confusing. The last map shown has the agent's position at (38,10) with `@` in the third line, fourth field. Let me parse the map again.

The map lines are:

                                  ##########                                    
                                  ##{..##.`#                                    
                                  #<.{@.{..#                                    
                                  ##..@`#..#                                    
                                  ##..###..#                                    
                                  ##.###...#                                    
                                  #######`{#                                    
                                  #######`.#                                    
                                  #######..#                                    
                                  ##########  

Each line represents a row. The agent's position (38,10) is in the 10th line (0-indexed?), but the way the map is displayed might be transposed. Assuming each line is a y-coordinate, and each character in the line is an x-coordinate. So for example, the third line (index 2) is ""#<.{@.{..#"", which would correspond to x=37 to x=45 (assuming each character is a cell). The agent's `@` is at position x=38, y=10. So in the map, the agent is in the 10th line (assuming the first line is y=0), but the exact layout might vary.

Given that, the boulder adjacent southeast would be at (39,11). The fountain is adjacent northwest at (37,9). So to push the boulder from (39,11) to (37,10) (which is a fountain), the agent needs to move into the boulder's position from the west or north.

But the agent is currently at (38,9). To reach the boulder at (39,11), the agent would need to move east and south. However, there are bars blocking the path. Alternatively, maybe the boulder is at a different position. Let me re-examine the language observations.

The latest language observation says: ""boulder adjacent southeast"" when the agent is at (38,9). Adjacent southeast would be (39,10). So the boulder is at (39,10). To push it west, the agent needs to be to the north of the boulder (38,10) or to the east (40,10). But moving north to (38,10) might be blocked by bars. The map shows at (38,10) a `@` in the third line, which is the agent's previous position. Wait, perhaps the map's third line (index 2) is y=2, and the agent's current y is 9. This is getting a bit confusing due to the map's orientation.

Alternatively, perhaps the best approach is to move west from (38,9) to (37,9), then try to push the boulder west. If moving west is possible (not blocked by bars), then the agent can position itself next to the boulder and push it west towards the fountain at (37,10).

Given that the agent's current position is (38,9) and the boulder is at (39,10), moving west to (37,9) would allow the agent to face the boulder from the west. Then, pushing the boulder west would move it to (38,10), which might be a path towards the fountain.

However, the bars are near eastnortheast, eastsoutheast, etc., which might be in the way. But since the agent is trying to move west, away from the bars, it's likely safe. The key is to get the boulder onto the fountain at (37,10).

So the next action should be to move west to (37,9), then push west towards the boulder. But first, check if moving west is possible. The language observation says ""bars very near north, northeast, east, eastsoutheast, southsoutheast, south, and southwest"" but the agent is at (38,9), and moving west to (37,9) would require checking if there's a bar there. The map shows at (37,9) a `#` which might be a wall, but in the latest map, the agent's line (38,9) is `##...` etc., so perhaps (37,9) is a floor.

Wait, looking at the map line for y=9 (assuming the 10th line is y=9), the characters are ""#######..#"". So position x=37 is part of the wall (#######), which means the agent can't move west into x=37, y=9 because it's a wall. That complicates things.

So the agent is at (38,9), and trying to move west into x=37, y=9 would hit a wall (#######..# at y=9). Therefore, the agent can't move west directly. Need to find another path.

Alternative approach: Move north to y=8, then west. But the map line for y=8 is ""#######`.#"", which at x=38 is a `.` (floor). So moving north to (38,8) is possible. Then, from there, move west to (37,8), which is part of the wall again. Hmm.

Alternatively, move south to y=10, which is the agent's previous position. At y=10, the map line is ""##...`#..#"", so x=38 is a `.` (floor). Then, from (38,10), move west to (37,10), which is the fountain. If the boulder is at (39,10), pushing west from (38,10) into the boulder would move it to (37,10), which is the fountain. That seems like a valid move.

So the steps would be:

1. Move north to (38,8) if possible.
2. Then move south to (38,10).
3. Push west into the boulder at (39,10), moving it to (37,10) (fountain).

But need to check if the path is clear. From (38,9) moving north to (38,8) is possible if there's no obstacle. The map at y=8 is ""#######`.#"", so x=38 is a `.` (floor). Then moving south to (38,10) is also a `.`. Then, at (38,10), the agent can push west into the boulder at (39,10), pushing it to (37,10).

This seems feasible. So the actions would be:

north, south, push west.

But since the user's previous attempts to push resulted in errors, need to ensure the syntax is correct. The valid actions are north, south, east, west, and push direction. So ""push west"" is a valid action if the agent is adjacent to the boulder.

Given the agent is at (38,10) after moving north and south, then pushing west would work. So the correct sequence is:

north (to 38,8), south (back to 38,10), then push west.

But the agent is already at (38,9) after the last default action. So first, move north to (38,8), then south to (38,10), then push west.

Alternatively, from (38,9), move north to (38,8), then east to (39,8), then south to (39,10), positioning next to the boulder, then push west. But that might be more steps.

Alternatively, since the boulder is at (39,10) (adjacent southeast of agent at (38,9)), the agent can move north to (38,10), which is adjacent to the boulder's position (39,10) if the boulder is there. Wait, no—adjacent southeast of (38,9) is (39,10). So the boulder is at (39,10). The agent is at (38,9). To push the boulder west, the agent needs to be to the north of the boulder (38,10) or to the east (40,10). Since the agent is at (38,9), moving north to (38,10) would place them north of the boulder at (39,10). Then, pushing west from (38,10) into the boulder would move it to (38,9), which is where the agent is. That's not helpful.

Wait, no—pushing a boulder requires the agent to move into it. So if the agent is at (38,10) and the boulder is at (39,10), the agent can move east into the boulder, pushing it east. But we want to push it west. So the agent needs to be to the west of the boulder. The boulder is at (39,10), so the agent needs to be at (38,10) to push it east, or at (37,10) to push it west. But the agent is at (38,9). To get to (37,10), they would need to move west and north.

This is getting complicated. Maybe the best approach is to move the agent to (37,10) and then push the boulder from there. But how?

Alternatively, look for a path to the boulder. The agent is at (38,9). The boulder is at (39,10). The agent can move east to (39,9), then south to (39,10), positioning next to the boulder, then push west to (38,10). But is that path clear?

From (38,9) moving east to (39,9): the map at y=9, x=39 is `#` (wall), so that's blocked. Can't move east.

So the agent can't move east. What about moving north to (38,8), then west to (37,8), but that's a wall. Hmm.

Another idea: The agent can move south to (38,10), then west to (37,10), which is the fountain. If the boulder is at (39,10), pushing it west from (38,10) would move it to (37,10), which is the fountain. So the steps are:

1. Move south from (38,9) to (38,10).
2. Push west into the boulder at (39,10), moving it to (37,10).

This seems possible. Let's verify:

- Moving south from (38,9) to (38,10): The map at y=10, x=38 is `@` in the third line, which might mean it's a floor. So that's allowed.
- Then, push west: The agent is at (38,10), the boulder is at (39,10). Pushing west would move the boulder to (38,10), but the agent is already there. Wait, no—pushing the boulder west from (38,10) would require the agent to move into the boulder from the west. Wait, no—the direction is west, so the agent needs to be to the north or east of the boulder to push it west.

Wait, confusion arises from the direction. If the agent is at (38,10) and wants to push the boulder west to (37,10), the agent needs to be to the north of the boulder. Because pushing west from the north would move the boulder west. So the agent should be at (38,10) (north of the boulder at (39,10)) and push west.

Wait, no. If the boulder is at (39,10), and the agent is at (38,10), then pushing west would require the agent to be to the east of the boulder. Because when you push a boulder, you move into it from the direction you're coming from. So if the agent is at (38,10) (west of the boulder at (39,10)), then pushing west would move the boulder to (38,10), which is where the agent is. That's not useful.

Wait, I think I have the directions mixed up. Let's clarify:

- To push a boulder north, the agent must move north into the boulder, which pushes it north.
- Similarly, to push west, the agent moves west into the boulder, pushing it west.

So if the boulder is at (39,10), and the agent is at (38,9), to push it west, the agent needs to move west into the boulder. But the agent is at (38,9), and the boulder is at (39,10). The agent would have to move to (39,9) to be west of the boulder, but that's blocked by a wall.

This is really challenging. Maybe the correct action here is to move the agent to a position where they can push the boulder west towards the fountain. Given the agent is at (38,9), perhaps moving north to (38,8), then east to (39,8) (if possible), then south to (39,10), positioning next to the boulder, then push west.

But moving east from (38,8) to (39,8): the map at y=8 is ""#######`.#"", so x=39 is a `.` (floor). Then moving south to (39,10): the boulder is at (39,10), so the agent can push west from there.

So the sequence would be:

1. north to (38,8)
2. east to (39,8)
3. south to (39,10)
4. push west

This would move the boulder from (39,10) to (38,10), which might be a path towards the fountain. However, the fountain is at (37,10), so the boulder needs to be pushed further west.

Alternatively, after pushing to (38,10), the agent can move west to (37,10) and push again. But that requires two pushes.

But given the current state, the immediate goal is to get the boulder onto the fountain. So pushing it to (38,10) is a step in the right direction, but not the final goal. The fountain is at (37,10), so another push west is needed.

However, the agent might need to navigate around obstacles to do that. Given the time constraints and the need to provide a single action, the best immediate action is to move the agent into a position to push the boulder west.

Given the agent is at (38,9), the only viable move that progresses towards the goal is to move north to (38,8), then south to (38,10), and then push west. But since the user can only choose one action at a time, the next action should be to move north to (38,8), which is a valid move as per the map.

Alternatively, since the agent is at (38,9) and the boulder is at (39,10), perhaps moving south to (38,10) and then pushing west is possible. Let's confirm:

- Moving south from (38,9) to (38,10): The map at y=10, x=38 is a `.` (floor), so that's allowed.","

Your previous output did not contain a valid action. Defaulted to action: north

Let's try to figure out what the agent should do next. The problem is the agent is stuck trying to push a boulder west, but it's not working, probably because there's a bar blocking the way. The previous attempts to push resulted in messages saying ""You cannot pass through the bars"" or ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" So the key here is to navigate around the bars or find another way to move the boulder.

Looking at the current position, the agent is at (38, 9). The boulder is adjacent to the southeast. The message says the bars are near eastnortheast, east, southeast, and westnorthwest. The cursor is on the agent, and the map shows some structures with '#' which are probably walls or bars.

The inventory has a lot of items, but since it's a box-pushing game, the relevant items might be the boulders and fountains. The goal is to push all boulders onto fountains. The agent needs to get the boulder near southsoutheast onto a fountain. But right now, the boulder is stuck because of the bars.

The agent tried pushing west before, but since there are bars in the way, maybe moving in another direction first is necessary. Maybe moving north or south to find a path around the bars. Let's check the map layout again. The map shows a lot of '#' which are obstacles. The agent is near the western part of the map, with stairs up near westsouthwest. The fountains are adjacent to southwest and eastsoutheast.

Wait, the language observation mentions a fountain adjacent to southwest. Maybe moving west further could reach the stairs or another path. Alternatively, since the boulder is to the southeast, perhaps the agent needs to move east to get behind the boulder and push it in another direction. But earlier attempts to push east didn't work because the boulder couldn't move there.

Another thought: Maybe the agent should move south to get past the bars. The bars are near eastnortheast, east, southeast, and westnorthwest. If the agent moves south, they might find a path that leads to the boulder's position. Alternatively, moving west to the stairs up might provide an exit, but the goal is to push boulders, not escape.

Looking at the cursor position and the map, the agent is near the edge of the map with a lot of bars. The boulder is southsoutheast, so maybe moving southeast could allow the agent to position themselves beside the boulder to push it westward. But the bars are blocking that path.

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to use an item from the inventory. The inventory has a blessed potion of extra healing, scrolls, food, etc. But in Boxoban, typically you don't use items to push boulders; you just move them by walking into them. So probably the solution is movement-based.

Since pushing west didn't work, maybe try moving south to get a different angle. Let's see: if the agent moves south from (38,9) to (38,10), maybe there's a path. The previous observations show that moving south from (38,11) was blocked by bars. But maybe at (38,9), moving south is possible.

Alternatively, moving west to (37,9) and then see if pushing the boulder from there is possible. But the agent was at (38,10) earlier and tried moving west, but the boulder was adjacent southeast. Wait, the boulder is near southsoutheast, so maybe the agent needs to get to the north of the boulder to push it south into a fountain.

But the current position is (38,9). Let's think step by step:

1. The boulder is at southsoutheast of the agent. So maybe coordinates (39,11) or similar.
2. To push the boulder west, the agent needs to be to the north or east of it.
3. If the agent is at (38,9), moving east to (39,9) might position them to the north of the boulder, allowing a push south into a fountain. But there's a bar at eastnortheast, which could be blocking that path.

Alternatively, moving south to (38,10) and then east to (39,10) might offer a clearer path. However, the bars are near east, so that might not be possible.

Another approach: Check the map for fountains. The fountains are adjacent to southwest and eastsoutheast. The agent needs to get the boulder to one of those. The boulder near southsoutheast is close to the eastsoutheast fountain. Maybe pushing it north into that fountain.

But to do that, the agent needs to get behind the boulder. If the boulder is at (39,11), the agent could move to (39,10) and then push north. But there are bars in the way.

Alternatively, the agent could try to move around the bars to find an open path. The bars are very near eastnortheast, east, southeast, and westnorthwest. So moving west from (38,9) to (37,9) might be possible if there's no bar there.

Looking at the cursor position and the map, the map shows ""##{.@##.`#"" at the relevant line. The agent is at position (38,9) which might correspond to the '@' symbol. The bars are denoted by '#', so moving west from (38,9) to (37,9) would be into a '.' or another symbol that's not a bar.

If the agent moves west to (37,9), then perhaps they can position themselves to push the boulder from there. But the boulder is at southsoutheast, so the agent would need to move in a different direction.

Wait, perhaps the agent should first move east to get closer to the boulder. From (38,9) moving east to (39,9), then try pushing west. But earlier attempts to push west didn't work, possibly because of the bars.

Alternatively, the agent could try moving south to (38,10) and then see if they can push the boulder from there. If there's a clear path south, they might be able to push the boulder into the fountain.

Considering all this, the most logical next step is to try moving in a direction that allows pushing the boulder away from the bars. Since pushing west has been blocked, maybe moving south to create space or find a different angle. Alternatively, moving east to get a better position.

But given the previous failures, perhaps the agent should first try to navigate around the bars. For example, moving west to (37,9) where there might be a clearer path, then attempt to push the boulder from there.

Alternatively, since the boulder is adjacent southeast, the agent could move south to (38,10) and then east to position themselves north of the boulder, allowing a push south into the fountain.

Another observation: The stairs up are near westsouthwest, so moving west further might lead to the stairs, but the priority is to push the boulder onto the fountain.

Given the current position and the need to avoid bars, the safest bet might be to move west to (37,9) and then try pushing the boulder again from that direction. If that's blocked, then move south to (38,10) and try another approach.

But the agent's previous attempts to push west resulted in failure, likely due to bars. So moving west first to see if there's a path.

So, the chosen action is to move west again, maybe the bars are not in that direction anymore, or perhaps the agent can find a way around.

69,west,"<reasoning>
Let's see what's going on here. The agent is in a Boxoban-like environment, trying to push boulders onto fountains. The goal is to navigate the environment, avoid obstacles like bars, and move the boulders correctly.

Looking at the current state:

- The agent is at position (37, 9).
- There's a boulder at (38, 11) based on previous moves, but after some failed attempts to push it west, the boulder might have moved or is blocked now.
- The map shows several bars and dark areas, which are obstacles.
- The fountains are located at specific positions, and the agent needs to get the boulders there.

The last few actions tried were pushing west, but that didn't work, so maybe the boulder is stuck due to bars. The agent is now at (37,9), and the boulder might be near here. The message ""You cannot pass through the bars"" suggests that the path is blocked by bars, so pushing the boulder further west isn't possible.

The current observation's language data indicates that there's a boulder very near the southeast, and a fountain adjacent to the south and west. The agent's position is (37,9), and the cursor is on the tourist. The map shows that there's a boulder at (38,9) perhaps? Or maybe the boulder is in another location. Need to check the map.

The map display has the agent's position marked with @. Looking at the map structure, line 3 (y=3) has ##{@.##.`# which might indicate the agent is at (38,3) considering the numbering, but the current cursor is at (37,9). Maybe the map's coordinate system is different. Regardless, the agent needs to move towards the boulder and find a way to push it towards a fountain.

Since the previous attempt to push west resulted in failure due to bars, the agent should try a different direction. Maybe north or south? Let's see the surrounding bars and fountains.

There's a fountain adjacent to the south and west. If the agent can move the boulder to the west towards the fountain, that would be ideal. But the bars are blocking the way. Alternatively, maybe moving north or south to find a path around the bars.

Another possibility is that the boulder is stuck, and the agent needs to find an alternative route to another boulder. But based on the observations, there's a boulder near the southeast and southsoutheast. The agent's current position is (37,9), so moving east might bring them closer to that boulder.

Wait, in the previous steps, the agent tried moving east and west multiple times, but the boulder wasn't successfully pushed. The latest observation shows the boulder very near the southeast. So maybe the agent needs to move east to reach that boulder and try pushing it south or west towards the fountain.

Given the current position (37,9), moving east would take the agent to (38,9), which is adjacent to the boulder. If the agent moves east, they can then attempt to push the boulder west towards the fountain at (westnorthwest), which is adjacent to the agent's current position.

But the language observation says there are bars adjacent to the northeast, north, and northwest. So moving east might be possible if there's no bar there. Let me check the language observations again.

The language observation mentions ""bars adjacent north, northeast, east, and northwest"". Wait, the agent is at (37,9), so east would be (38,9). The bars adjacent to the agent's current position are north, northeast, east, and northwest. So moving east might be blocked by a bar. That's a problem.

If moving east is blocked by a bar, the agent can't go there. Then maybe moving south or north? The agent's current position is (37,9). Moving south to (37,10) might be possible if there's no bar there. Looking at the map, line 10 (y=10) has #######..# which is a path with bars at the ends. So moving south from (37,9) to (37,10) would be into a bar area? Wait, the bars are near the edges, so perhaps moving south is possible.

Alternatively, the agent could try moving west to (36,9), but the bars adjacent to the agent's position include west? The language observation says bars are adjacent north, northeast, east, and northwest. So west is not directly adjacent. So moving west might be possible.

Wait, the bars adjacent are north, northeast, east, and northwest. So the agent's current position (37,9) has bars to the north (maybe in the map's line 8?), northeast (direction), east (which would be (38,9)), and northwest (direction). If the agent tries to move east to (38,9), but there's a bar adjacent there, so they can't pass through.

Therefore, moving east is blocked. Moving west to (36,9) might be possible if there's no bar there. Let's check the map. The map's line 3 (y=3) at x=37 is part of ##{@.##.`# which might have a bar at x=37, y=3? Not sure. Alternatively, the bars mentioned in the language observation are in other areas.

Given the complexity, perhaps the best move is to try moving south to (37,10) to see if there's a path around the bars, then attempt to push the boulder from there. Alternatively, move north to (37,8) to avoid the bars.

But the agent needs to focus on the boulder. The boulder is very near the southeast. The agent is at (37,9), so southeast would be (38,10) or similar. If the agent can move east and then south to reach the boulder, they can push it west towards the fountain at westnorthwest.

However, moving east is blocked by a bar. Therefore, the agent should look for another direction. Maybe moving north to (37,8) where there are fewer obstacles.

Alternatively, the agent could try to move southwest or southeast, but the cursor's position is (37,9), and the map's structure might not allow that.

Another approach: Since pushing west previously failed due to bars, maybe the agent should try pushing the boulder south towards the fountain adjacent to the south. If the boulder is at (38,11), pushing it south might move it towards the fountain at (southeast), but need to check the map.

Wait, in the initial steps, the boulder was pushed east to (38,11), but then subsequent pushes west failed. The agent is now at (37,9), so the boulder might be at (38,11) but blocked by bars. Therefore, the agent needs to find a way to get around the bars to push the boulder.

Alternatively, maybe the boulder is now at a different position. The language observation mentions a boulder very near the southeast, which could be at (38,10) or (39,9). The agent needs to move towards that boulder.

Given the agent's current position (37,9), moving east to (38,9) is blocked by a bar. Moving south to (37,10) might be possible. Let's check the map's line 10: #######..# which is at y=10. The agent is at y=9, so moving south to y=10 would be into the #######..# area. The first part is ####### which might be bars, but the last two are .., so maybe it's a path. If the agent moves south to (37,10), they can then proceed east or west.

Alternatively, moving west to (36,9) could be possible if there's no bar there. The language observation says bars are adjacent north, northeast, east, and northwest, so west is not adjacent. Therefore, moving west to (36,9) should be possible.

Once the agent is at (36,9), they can try moving east towards the boulder. But if moving east from (36,9) is blocked by a bar at (37,9), then they can't. Alternatively, moving south to (36,10) and then east.

This is getting a bit complicated. Let's try to outline a possible path:

1. From (37,9), move west to (36,9) since there are no adjacent bars in that direction.
2. From (36,9), move south to (36,10). Check if that's possible (map line 10 at x=36 is #, which might be a bar, but the line is #######..# so positions 0-6 are #, 7-8 are .. So x=36 (assuming 0-based or 1-based indexing) might be a #, which is a bar. Therefore, moving south to (36,10) is blocked.
   
Alternative path:
1. Move south from (37,9) to (37,10). The map's line 10 at x=37 is # (since #######..#), so that's a bar. Can't move south.

Hmm. Then maybe move north to (37,8). Check the map's line 8 (assuming y decreases as the map goes down). Line 8 is #######`.# which at x=37 would be the last # before the `. So (37,8) is a bar. Can't move north.

This is tricky. The agent is surrounded by bars on the north, northeast, east, and northwest. The only possible directions are south and west, but moving south is blocked by a bar at (37,10), and moving west might be possible if there's no bar.

Wait, the language observation says bars adjacent north, northeast, east, and northwest. So west is not adjacent. Therefore, moving west to (36,9) should be possible.

So:

1. Move west to (36,9).
2. From there, check if there's a path east to the boulder.

At (36,9), looking at the map's line 3 (y=3) which is ##{@.##.`# — maybe this is the agent's position at (38,3), but I'm getting confused with the coordinate system. Alternatively, the map's display might have the top-left as (0,0) or (1,1). This is unclear, but assuming the agent is at (37,9), moving west to (36,9) is possible.

Once at (36,9), the agent can try moving east again. If there's a bar at (37,9), moving east from (36,9) would be into (37,9), which has a bar adjacent. So that's blocked.

Alternative idea: The boulder is very near the southeast. The agent is at (37,9), so southeast would be (38,10) or (39,9). If the agent moves east to (38,9), which is blocked, but maybe from (38,9) they can move south to (38,10) and then push the boulder west.

But the agent can't reach (38,9) due to the bar. So perhaps the agent needs to find a different route.

Another possibility: The stairs up are near westnorthwest. Maybe the agent needs to go there to exit, but the goal is to push boulders, not climb stairs.

Alternatively, the agent has an inventory with items like a potion of extra healing and food, but those aren't useful for pushing boulders.

Given the constraints, the best action might be to move west to (36,9) and then see if there's a path east around the bars. Alternatively, try pushing the boulder in another direction if possible.

Wait, the latest message says ""You cannot pass through the bars,"" which suggests that the agent's previous attempt to move through a bar was blocked. So the agent needs to find a path that doesn't involve bars.

Given all this, the safest move is to move west to (36,9) to avoid the adjacent bars and then look for a new path.

Let's see. The goal is to push the boulder onto the fountain. The agent is at (36,9). In the previous steps, the boulder was near eastsoutheast and the agent tried to move it west multiple times but failed because of bars or obstacles. Now, looking at the current map:

The agent is at (36,9) and the cursor shows themselves as '@'. The boulder is adjacent to the southeast? Or maybe south? The language observation mentions a boulder far east and southsoutheast, and near eastsoutheast. The stairs are up adjacent southwest. The fountain is near eastsoutheast. 

The agent needs to move the boulder towards the fountain. The last move was west to (36,9). The boulder might be at (37,9) or (38,9). The message after moving west says ""You cannot pass through the bars."" So the path is blocked by bars. Maybe the boulder is against bars or another obstacle. 

The previous attempts to push west resulted in failure because there's a bar in the way. So perhaps the agent needs to position themselves next to the boulder without getting blocked. Let me check the map again. The map shows in position (37,9) there's a `#` which is a wall or bar. The agent is at (36,9) with '@', and to the east is a `#`, so the boulder must be further east. 

Wait, the map line for y=9 is: ##@..##.`# So positions 36 is '@', 37 is '.', 38 is '#', etc. So the boulder is probably at (38,9) but blocked by a bar. The agent tried to push west but can't because the boulder is against a bar. So maybe the agent needs to move to a position where they can push the boulder north or south around the bars. 

Alternatively, perhaps the boulder is at (37,9) but blocked by a bar at (38,9). So to push the boulder west, the agent needs to be to the west of the boulder, but the path is blocked. So maybe move north or south to find a way around. 

Looking at the language observation, there's a fountain adjacent southeast. So the fountain is to the southeast of the agent's current position. The boulder is far east and southsoutheast. Maybe the boulder is at (38,10) or (38,11). The agent needs to navigate to push it towards the fountain. 

Since pushing west isn't working due to bars, maybe try moving north or south to get a different angle. For example, move north to (36,8) and see if the boulder can be pushed from there. Alternatively, check if there's a clear path to the east where the boulder can be moved towards the fountain. 

Another possibility is that the agent needs to use a different direction. Since the boulder is east, maybe pushing it north or south around the bars. The stairs are up adjacent southwest, but that's probably not relevant right now. 

The key is to find a path where the agent can push the boulder towards the fountain without hitting bars. Based on the current map and observations, the agent is at (36,9). If the boulder is at (38,9) blocked by a bar at (39,9), then pushing west isn't possible. The agent could try moving north to (36,8) and then see if the boulder can be pushed north or south from there. 

Alternatively, check the map for other directions. The agent could move south to (36,10) and attempt to push the boulder from there. Looking at the map, at y=10, the agent's position is part of a longer corridor. Maybe there's a way to the south to access the boulder. 

In the current observation, the agent's inventory has a blessed potion of extra healing and other items, but those aren't needed for pushing the boulder. The main task is to move the boulder using movement and push actions. 

Given the previous failures when trying to push west, the next logical step is to try a different direction. Perhaps moving north to (36,8) and then attempting to push the boulder north or west. Alternatively, move south to (36,10) and see if there's a path. 

Looking at the language observation, bars are very near eastnortheast, southsouthwest, etc. The agent's current position has bars near northeast, west, and northwest. So moving north might lead to more bars. Moving south might have different obstacles. 

Another angle: the fountain is adjacent southeast. So if the boulder can be moved southeast, that would help. But the boulder is currently far east and southsoutheast. Maybe the agent needs to move the boulder in a southeast direction. 

Wait, the boulder is far east and southsoutheast. The agent is at (36,9). To push the boulder southeast, the agent would need to be to the northwest of the boulder. So perhaps moving east towards the boulder first. But the agent tried moving east before and hit bars or the boulder didn't budge. 

Alternatively, maybe the boulder is adjacent to the agent's current position. If the agent is at (36,9) and the boulder is at (37,9), but there's a bar at (38,9), pushing west would require the boulder to move into (37,9), which is blocked by the agent's current position. Wait, no—the agent is at (36,9), so (37,9) is east. If the boulder is at (38,9), blocked by a bar at (39,9), then the agent needs to be at (37,9) to push it west. But the agent is at (36,9), so moving east to (37,9) first, then pushing west. 

So the sequence would be: move east to (37,9), then push west. But the previous attempt to move east resulted in a message about trying to move the boulder but failing. Wait, in the earlier steps, when the agent moved east, the message was ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" That suggests that the agent was next to the boulder but couldn't push it because of an obstacle behind it. 

So if the agent is at (36,9), moves east to (37,9), which is a '.' (floor), then the boulder is at (38,9), blocked by a bar at (39,9). Then, pushing the boulder west from (38,9) to (37,9) would require the agent to be at (37,9). But if the agent is at (37,9), they can push the boulder west into (36,9), which is where the agent is. That's not possible because the agent can't be in two places at once. 

Therefore, the agent needs to position themselves to the west of the boulder. So the boulder is at (38,9), agent needs to be at (37,9), then push west to (36,9). But the agent is already at (36,9). So perhaps the boulder is at (37,9), and the agent is trying to push it west to (36,9), but there's a bar at (36,9) which is the agent's current position. That can't be right. 

Wait, the map shows at (36,9) the agent is '@', at (37,9) it's '.', and (38,9) is '#'. So the boulder must be at (37,9) because that's the only floor space east of the agent before the bar. So the boulder is at (37,9), and the agent is at (36,9). To push the boulder west, the agent needs to be adjacent to it. Since the agent is already west of the boulder (at 36,9 vs boulder at 37,9), they should be able to push it west. But earlier attempts resulted in failure messages. 

The message when pushing west was ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" Which implies that there's an obstacle behind the boulder preventing it from being pushed. So the boulder is at (37,9), and behind it (38,9) is a bar. So when the agent tries to push the boulder west to (36,9), the path is clear, but maybe the boulder is stuck for another reason. 

Alternatively, perhaps the boulder is being pushed into a position where it's blocked. Wait, if the agent is at (36,9) and pushes the boulder west to (37,9), but (37,9) is already the boulder's current position. That doesn't make sense. Maybe the boulder is at (38,9), blocked by a bar at (39,9). So the agent needs to push it from (38,9) to (37,9), but the agent is at (36,9). They would need to move east to (37,9), then push west. 

So the correct sequence would be: move east to (37,9), then push west to (36,9). But the agent is already at (36,9), so moving east first. Let's check the previous steps. The last action was west to (36,9), and before that, east to (38,11) with a failure. 

Given the confusion, perhaps the best action now is to move north or south to find a different path. Let's look at the map again. At y=8, the agent was at (38,8), but after moving north, they are at (38,9). The map for y=9 shows ##@..##.`#, so the agent is in the fifth position (0-based index 4?), surrounded by walls on the east and west. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent should move south to y=10, where there's a longer corridor. At y=10, the map line is ##..###..#, which is more open. The agent could move south to (36,10) and then attempt to push the boulder from there. 

Another possibility is that the boulder is at (38,10) or (38,11), and the agent needs to go there. But without seeing the exact map layout, it's tricky. 

Based on the latest observation, the agent is at (36,9), and the boulder is far east and southsoutheast. The fountain is near eastsoutheast. The agent needs to move the boulder towards the fountain. Since pushing west isn't working, perhaps moving east to get closer to the boulder. 

Wait, the language observation says ""boulder far east and southsoutheast"". So the boulder is to the east and southeast of the agent. The agent is at (36,9). So moving east towards (37,9), (38,9), etc., but those positions are blocked by bars. 

Alternatively, moving southeast to (37,10) or (38,10) where there might be a path. Let's check the map for y=10: ##..###..# — positions 36 is '#', 37 is '.', 38 is '.', 39 is '#', etc. So at (37,10), there's a floor. So the agent could move south to (36,10), then east to (37,10), then perhaps push the boulder from there. 

But how to confirm the boulder's location? The language observation mentions a boulder far east and southsoutheast. If the agent moves southeast to (37,10), they might be closer. 

Alternatively, the agent could try pushing the boulder north. If the boulder is at (38,9), pushing north to (38,8) might be possible if there's no obstacle. The map for y=8 is not shown, but assuming it's similar, there might be a path. 

Given the uncertainty, the safest bet is to try moving in a direction that allows approaching the boulder. Since pushing west isn't working, moving east towards the boulder's general direction might help. 

So the next action could be east to (37,9). Let's see if that's possible. The current cursor is at (36,9), and moving east would take the agent to (37,9), which is a floor. If the boulder is at (38,9), then moving east to (37,9) allows the agent to attempt pushing it west. 

But earlier attempts to move east resulted in failure. Wait, in the previous steps, when the agent was at (38,11) and tried to move east, they got a message about trying to move the boulder but failing. That might have been because the boulder was blocked. 

In the current position, moving east to (37,9) is possible, and then pushing west. The agent needs to be adjacent to the boulder to push it. So if the boulder is at (38,9), then after moving east to (37,9), pushing west would attempt to move it to (36,9), which is where the agent is. That can't be right. 

Wait, no—the boulder is at (38,9), agent is at (37,9). To push the boulder west, the agent needs to move into the boulder's tile and then it moves west. So the agent would move from (37,9) to (38,9), pushing the boulder to (37,9). But the agent is already at (37,9), so that doesn't work. 

This is getting confusing. Maybe the boulder is actually at (37,9), and the agent is at (36,9). So pushing west would move the boulder to (36,9), but the agent is there. That's impossible. Hence, the failure message. 

Therefore, the boulder must be at (38,9), and the agent needs to get to (37,9) to push it west. So the correct action is move east to (37,9), then push west. 

But in the current observation, the agent is at (36,9), and moving east would take them to (37,9), which is a floor. So the next action should be east. Once there, then push west. 

However, in the previous attempts, moving east led to failure. But that might have been because the boulder was already at (38,9) and pushing it required being adjacent. 

So the sequence would be:

1. Move east to (37,9).
2. Push west.

If that works, the boulder would move to (36,9), which is the agent's current position. That can't happen, so perhaps the boulder is pushed to (37,9), replacing the agent's position. Wait, no—the agent would have to move into the boulder's tile to push it. 

I think the correct approach is to move east to (37,9) and then push west. Even if it results in a failure message, it's necessary to try. Alternatively, the agent might need to move in a different direction. 

Another possibility is that the boulder is blocked by a bar at (39,9), so pushing it west from (38,9) to (37,9) is possible if there's no obstacle. Then the agent can move into the new boulder position. 

Given the confusion in the map layout, the best course is to try moving east to get adjacent to the boulder and then push west. So the next action is east.

",-0.001,False
71,push west,"<reasoning>
The agent is trying to solve Boxoban. Let's look at the current state.

The agent is at (37, 9). The boulder is adjacent to the east. The previous attempts to push the boulder west resulted in either failure or hitting bars. Now, the message says ""message:"" which might be empty, but the language observations show the boulder is very near eastsoutheast and southsoutheast.

The agent tried pushing west before but failed because of bars. Maybe the boulder is stuck between bars and needs a different approach. Since the boulder is to the east, perhaps pushing it east towards a fountain would help. But the map shows bars in the south, so maybe moving the agent to a position where they can push the boulder around the bars.

Alternatively, the agent could move around the boulder to the north or south to find a way to push it. The stairs up are near westsouthwest, but the priority is pushing the boulder onto the fountain. Looking at the map, the fountain is adjacent northwest and southeast. The boulder needs to be moved to the fountain adjacent northwest or southeast.

Wait, the current map shows the boulder is at (38,9) (since agent is at 37,9 and boulder is adjacent east). The fountain is adjacent southwest. So moving the boulder west towards the fountain might not work because there are bars blocking. The agent needs to find a path to push the boulder around the bars.

Maybe move north or south to get around the bars and then push the boulder. The previous attempts to move south resulted in hitting bars. Perhaps moving north from (37,9) to (37,8) could allow approaching the boulder from the north and pushing it west.

But in the current observation, moving north from (37,9) would lead to position (37,8). Looking at the map, there's a ""##########"" wall structure which might be bars blocking the path. Alternatively, the agent needs to check if there's a way to maneuver the boulder by first moving in a direction that allows it to bypass the bars.

Another approach: since the boulder is at (38,9), maybe push it south towards the fountain adjacent southeast. But the language observation shows bars adjacent southeast and south. Pushing the boulder south would hit the bars. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, push the boulder east, but the message said ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain"" when trying east before. That suggests there's an obstacle behind the boulder east, perhaps another boulder or a bar.

Wait, in the previous steps, the boulder was adjacent east. When the agent tried to push west, it didn't work because of bars. Maybe the boulder is stuck between bars on the west and another obstacle on the east. So the agent needs to find a way to move the boulder around.

Looking at the map, the agent is at (37,9). To the east is the boulder. To the west are bars. To the north, there's a part of the wall structure. To the south, there are bars again. So the agent is in a spot surrounded by bars except east, where the boulder is.

The only possible moves are north, east (but can't push boulder east), south (blocked by bars), or west (blocked by bars). Wait, the agent is at (37,9). If the boulder is at (38,9), then to the west of the agent is a space (cursor position is @ at 37,9, and boulder at 38,9). So the agent can move west to 36,9, but earlier attempts showed that moving west from there led to more bars.

Alternatively, the agent needs to find a way to move the boulder by first moving around it. For example, move north, then try pushing the boulder west. But the current position's north might be blocked.

Looking at the map, the line for y=8 (since agent is at y=9) has ""##{@.##.`#"". So at (37,9), the agent is in a corridor. Moving north to y=8 would take them to position (37,8), which is part of the wall structure. So that's blocked.

Hmm, this is tricky. The agent might need to go around to the south. But moving south from (37,9) would go to y=10, which in the map is ""##.###...#"". So at (37,10), there's a "" "" (floor) or obstacle? The map shows that line as ""#...`#..#"", so maybe position (37,10) is a floor. Let me check the map again.

The map for each y-coordinate:

Looking at the map provided:

Line for y=9: ##{@.##.`# → So at x=37 (assuming the agent is at (37,9)), the character is '{', which might be a wall or part of the structure. Wait, the agent's position is (37,9), which in the map line for y=9 is ""##{@.##.`#"". Breaking it down:

x=35: '#'

x=36: '#'

x=37: '{@'

Wait, maybe the agent's position is at x=37, y=9, which in the map is '{@', meaning the agent is there. So to the east (x=38, y=9) is the boulder, which is represented by '•' or similar. But in the map, the boulder might be part of the environment. Wait, the map symbols might not be standard. In Boxoban, usually, the player is '@', boulders are '$', fountains are 'O', etc. But here, the map uses different symbols. For example, the boulder adjacent east might be shown as a specific character.

Looking at the initial observations, when the agent pushed the boulder east, the message said ""With great effort you move the boulder."" But in the map, the symbols didn't change, which is confusing. Maybe the map uses other symbols for boulders and fountains. The user's map shows things like '{', '<', '.', '`', etc., which are unclear.

Given the confusion in map symbols, maybe relying more on the language observations would be better. The language observation says ""boulder very near east"" at (38,9). The agent is at (37,9). To push the boulder west, the agent needs to move into it from the west (west direction) and then push. But the previous attempt to push west resulted in a message ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" That suggests there's an obstacle behind the boulder west, preventing it from being pushed further west.

Looking at the language observation, there are bars adjacent southeast and south. The boulder is at (38,9), so to the west of it is the agent's position. To the west of the boulder (x=37,9) is the agent, and to the southwest (x=37,10) there might be bars. So pushing the boulder west would require clearing the path beyond it, but there are bars blocking.

Alternatively, maybe the boulder can be pushed north or south around the bars. The agent could move north to y=8, but the map shows a wall there. Moving south to y=10, which in the map is ""##.###...#"". At x=37, y=10, the character is '#', which is a wall. So that's blocked.

This is challenging. The agent needs to find a way to maneuver the boulder past the bars. Since pushing west isn't working because of bars, maybe the agent should move around the boulder to the north or south. For example, move north to y=8, then try pushing the boulder east. But y=8's map line is ""##{..##.`#"", which at x=37 is '.', a floor. So moving north to (37,8) is possible. Then from there, pushing the boulder east towards a fountain.

But how does that work? If the agent is at (37,8) and the boulder is at (38,9), moving east from (37,8) would take the agent to (38,8), and then push the boulder to (39,8). But need to check if that's possible.

Alternatively, move the agent to the northeast or southeast to find a path. However, given the current layout, the agent is surrounded by bars and the boulder. The only possible move might be to push the boulder east, but earlier attempts failed. Maybe the obstacle behind the boulder is another boulder or a wall.

Looking back at the language observations, there's a boulder very near eastsoutheast and southeast. So perhaps pushing the boulder east would move it into a position where it can then be pushed south towards the fountain.

Wait, the fountain is adjacent southwest. If the boulder can be moved to the southwest position, that would solve the level. To get there, the boulder needs to be pushed southwest around the bars.

Given the complexity, the best action might be to continue trying to push the boulder in a direction that leads toward a fountain, even if it requires multiple pushes. Since the agent is at (37,9) with the boulder at (38,9), pushing west is not working due to bars. Maybe pushing the boulder south into a different position.

But the language observation says bars adjacent southeast and south, so pushing south would hit the bars. Alternatively, push the boulder east into the southeast direction where there's a fountain. The fountain is near eastsoutheast and southeast. If the boulder can be pushed east into that area, it would be on a fountain.

To do that, the agent needs to move to the east of the boulder and push it. But the agent is already adjacent. Maybe the problem is that there's an obstacle behind the boulder east. The language observation mentions ""boulders near southsoutheast"", so perhaps another boulder is blocking the path.

In that case, the agent needs to move the boulder around the other boulder. But without knowing the exact positions, it's hard to say. Given the limited information, the next best action is to try pushing the boulder east again, even though it failed before, maybe in a different context now. Alternatively, move the agent to a different position to create a path.

Another approach: since the agent is at (37,9) and the boulder is at (38,9), the agent could move north to (37,8) and then try pushing the boulder east. But first, check if moving north is possible. The map at y=8 is ""##{..##.`#"", which at x=37 is a '.', so possible. So move north to (37,8), then push east.

But the message when trying to push east before was a failure. Maybe now that the agent is north, the path is clear. Alternatively, the obstacle behind the boulder is now in a different position.

Given the time constraints and the need to avoid repeating the same actions, the best bet is to try pushing the boulder in a direction that aligns with the nearest fountain. The fountain adjacent southwest suggests moving the boulder southwest. To do that, the agent needs to push the boulder south and then west. But pushing south hits bars. Alternatively, push west first, then south.

But pushing west is blocked by bars. This is quite tricky. Maybe the solution is to move the agent around the boulder to the north and then push it west. For example, move north to (37,8), then west to (36,8), then push the boulder north or west.

Alternatively, given the agent's current position and the boulder's location, the best action is to continue trying to push the boulder west, even if it failed before, in case the environment has changed. However, the tip says to avoid repeating the same action if nothing changes. But maybe in this case, it's necessary.

Alternatively, move the agent to the southwest to find a path. But without knowing the map layout well, it's hard to say.

After considering all options, the most probable action is to attempt pushing the boulder west again, even though it previously failed, in case the bars have moved or there's a different path now. Alternatively, move the agent to a different position to find a clear path.

But given the current information, the best bet is to push the boulder west again, as that's the direction towards a fountain (adjacent northwest), and maybe the bars have shifted.

",-0.001,False
72,push west,"<reasoning>
Let's see what's going on here. The agent's been moving around trying to push a boulder onto a fountain, but there are a lot of obstacles like bars blocking the path. The last few attempts to push the boulder west didn't work because of the bars. The current position is (37, 9), and there's a boulder adjacent to the east. The nearest fountain is to the west, but there's a bar adjacent to the southeast and south. The stairs up are to the westsouthwest, which might be a way out, but the goal is to push the boulder onto the fountain.

Looking at the map, the agent is surrounded by bars on the south and southeast. The boulder is right next to them to the east. Maybe the agent needs to move the boulder further west to reach the fountain. But how? The bars are blocking direct movement. Perhaps the agent needs to move around to a position where they can push the boulder past the bars. Alternatively, maybe there's a path clear to the west where the boulder can be moved towards the fountain. Let me check the language observations again.

The language observation mentions bars adjacent to the southeast and south, and a fountain adjacent to the northwest. The agent is at (37,9), and the fountain is to the northwest. Wait, the fountain is near the stairs up in the westsouthwest. Maybe moving north or west could provide a path. But the agent just tried moving north and hit the bars again. 

Let me think. The boulder is to the east (x=38, y=9), right? So if the agent moves west, they can get next to the boulder. But the bars are in the way. The agent needs to find a way to navigate around the bars to push the boulder. Maybe moving south first could avoid the bars blocking the north. Let me check the map again. The bars are very near eastnortheast, east, southeast, and westnorthwest. So moving south might open up a path. Alternatively, moving west to get next to the boulder and then pushing it west when there's space. 

Wait, the agent's current position is at (37,9), and the boulder is at (38,9). The bars are adjacent to the southeast and south. So if the agent moves south to y=10, maybe there's a path. Let me check the observations. Previously, moving south resulted in ""You cannot pass through the bars."" So maybe the south direction is blocked by bars. What about west? The agent tried west and then east multiple times, but the boulder isn't moving. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent should try to move north again, but that's blocked by bars. Perhaps there's a different approach. The inventory has some items, but none that seem directly useful for removing obstacles. The goal is to push the boulder onto the fountain. The fountain is adjacent to northwest, which is west direction. So maybe the agent needs to get the boulder to the west side. But the bars are in the way. 

Wait, the stairs up are near westsouthwest, which is southwest of the agent's current position. Maybe moving southwest could reach the stairs, but that's not the goal. The priority is to push the boulder. Let me think again. The boulder is at (38,9), and the fountain is to the northwest (west direction from the boulder's position). So if the agent can push the boulder west from (38,9) to (37,9), then (36,9), etc., until it's on the fountain. But the bars are blocking that path. 

The agent needs to find a way to get around the bars. The bars adjacent to southeast and south might be near (37,10) and (38,9) south. If the agent moves south to (37,10), maybe there's a path. But previous attempts to move south were blocked. Alternatively, moving west to (36,9) and then north or south. Hmm. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent should pick up an item that can help break the bars, but the inventory doesn't show any tools like a pickaxe. The available actions are movement and pushing. Since the agent tried pushing west before but failed due to bars, perhaps the only way is to move around the bars. Let's see. If the agent moves west to (36,9), then north to (36,8), maybe that's clear. But the map doesn't show clear paths. 

The agent's current map shows a lot of ########## which are walls or obstacles. The boulder is at (38,9), and the fountain is to the northwest. The stairs up are in the westsouthwest. The agent is stuck between bars and needs to find a path to move the boulder. Since pushing west isn't working because of bars, maybe the agent needs to move the boulder in another direction temporarily. For example, push it north or south if possible, then move it west. 

Looking at the language observation, bars are adjacent to southeast and south. So pushing the boulder south might be possible if there's space. Let me check the message when the agent tried pushing west before. The message said ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" Which probably means there's an obstacle behind it. So the boulder can't be moved west because there's a bar or another obstacle. 

Therefore, the agent needs to clear the path. Since there are no tools, the only way is to navigate around. Maybe move the agent to a position where they can push the boulder around the bars. For example, move north to (37,8) if that's clear, then push the boulder west. But previous moves north resulted in hitting bars. 

Alternatively, move west to (36,9), then north to (36,8), then check if pushing the boulder west from there is possible. But this requires pathfinding. Given the limited information from observations, it's challenging. 

The agent's best bet might be to keep trying to push the boulder west, hoping that the previous observations were misleading, but the messages indicate that it's blocked. Alternatively, try moving the agent in a different direction to create space. For example, move south to see if there's a way around, but earlier attempts showed that's blocked. 

Wait, the latest observation after trying to push west says, ""You cannot pass through the bars."" So the bars are definitely in the way. The only way to proceed is to find a way to move around the bars. Perhaps the agent should move east to get next to the boulder and then try a different direction. But moving east would take the agent back to (38,9), which is where the boulder is. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent can pick up the boulder and carry it, but in Boxoban, you push boulders, not carry them. So the agent needs to push. 

Given all this, the most logical action is to continue trying to push the boulder west, but since that's blocked, perhaps the agent needs to move in a different direction to find a path. However, without clearer map details, it's hard to say. 

Considering the previous actions and the lack of progress, maybe the agent should try a different sequence. For example, move south, then west, then north, to see if that opens up a path. But earlier moves south were blocked. 

Alternatively, check if moving west from the current position (37,9) to (36,9) is possible. The agent tried west and ended up at (37,9) again, so maybe there's a wall there. Wait, no—the agent was at (38,9) previously and moved west to (37,9). So moving west from (37,9) would go to (36,9). Let me check the map. The map shows at position (38,9) there's a boulder (@), and to the west is a dot, which might be a floor. So maybe moving west from (37,9) to (36,9) is possible if there's no obstacle. But the language observation says bars are adjacent to the northwest, which might be at (36,8) or similar. 

This is getting a bit confusing. Given the limited information, the safest bet might be to try pushing the boulder west again, despite the previous failure, in case the observation was outdated. Alternatively, move the agent to a position where they can push the boulder in a different direction. 

Another possibility is that the boulder is stuck because there's a bar behind it. So the agent needs to move the boulder in a direction that allows it to be pushed past the bar. For example, push it north around the bar, then west. But without knowing the exact layout, it's hard to plan. 

Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, I'll go with pushing the boulder west again, hoping that maybe the bars were temporarily an obstacle or the agent found a new path.

Let me try to figure out what to do here. The agent is stuck in this Boxoban-like game. The goal is to push boulders onto fountains. From the observations, there's a boulder adjacent to the east, and there's a fountain to the northwest. The agent is at position (38, 11) initially, but after moving around, they're now at (37, 9).

The problem is that the agent keeps hitting bars when trying to push the boulder west. The latest observation shows that there's a boulder adjacent east, and when trying to push west, it's blocked by bars. The map has a lot of bars surrounding areas, making movement tricky. The agent needs to find a path to position the boulder near the fountain.

Looking at the map, the agent is near the stairs up at westnorthwest. Maybe moving towards the stairs could help, but the priority is pushing the boulder. The fountain is adjacent northwest, so if the boulder can be moved west past the bars, that would solve the problem. But the agent can't push the boulder west because there are bars in the way. Perhaps the agent needs to move around to a different position to get a clear path to push the boulder.

Wait, the latest message says ""You cannot pass through the bars."" So the bars are blocking the path when trying to push. The agent might need to find an open space to maneuver. Let me check the cursor position again. The agent is at (37, 9), and the boulder is adjacent east. If the agent moves west again, maybe they can get next to the boulder? But the previous attempts to push west resulted in failure. Alternatively, maybe moving north or south could create a path.

Looking at the language observation, the bars are very near eastnortheast, east, southeast, and westnorthwest. The agent is near westnorthwest stairs, so moving west again might hit the bars. The fountain is adjacent northwest, so perhaps moving north could bring the boulder closer. But the agent's current position is (37,9), and the fountain is northwest, which would be north and west. However, moving north might hit bars. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to go around the bars to the south. Let's see the map layout. The map has a lot of '######' which are probably walls or bars. The agent is in a position where moving west is blocked by bars. The boulder is east of the agent. So to push the boulder west, the agent needs to be west of it, but the bars are in the way. 

Perhaps the agent should move north or south to create a path. For example, moving north from (37,9) to (37,8) might be possible if there's no bar there. Checking the language observation, bars are very near eastnortheast, east, southeast, and westnorthwest. So the immediate north of the agent might be clear. If the agent moves north once or twice, they can position themselves to the northwest of the boulder, then push it west. 

So the steps could be: move north to (37,8), then west to (36,8), then push west to move the boulder to (35,8). But need to check if those positions are blocked by bars. The language observation mentions bars near eastnortheast, southsoutheast, etc., but not specifically at (36,8) or (35,8). Assuming those are clear, this could work. Alternatively, if moving north is blocked, then try south. 

Another approach: since the agent is at (37,9) and the boulder is at (38,9), pushing west would require the agent to be at (38,9) and then move west, but there's a bar adjacent west to the boulder. So the agent needs to be one space away from the boulder in the direction they want to push. So to push the boulder west, the agent needs to be at (38,9) and then move west. But currently, the agent is at (37,9), so they need to move one step east to (38,9) to push. However, the message says ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain,"" which might mean there's an obstacle behind the boulder when trying to push. 

Looking back at the initial problem, when the user first tried to push west, the message said they couldn't pass through the bars. So perhaps the boulder is against a bar or another obstacle when trying to push. The agent needs to ensure there's nothing behind the boulder when pushing. Maybe the boulder is against a wall or another boulder. 

In the latest map, the boulder is adjacent east at (38,9). If the agent moves east to (38,9), then tries to push west, but there's a bar at (38,8) or similar, that would block the push. The language observation says bars adjacent southeast and south at the agent's current position. So if the boulder is at (38,9), pushing west would go to (38,8), which has bars. Hence, the push is blocked. 

So the solution might be to move the boulder around the bars. For example, move the boulder south to a position where there's no bars, then push it west. Let's see: the agent is at (37,9). Move east to (38,9) (where the boulder is), then move south to (38,10). If that's possible, then push the boulder west from (38,10) to (38,9), but that's back where it was. Alternatively, move the boulder south to (38,10), then west to (37,10), then north or something. 

Checking the map, the area south of (38,9) seems to have '##########' which are probably walls. So moving south from the boulder's position might be blocked. Alternatively, moving north from the boulder's position. 

This is getting complicated. Maybe the agent needs to find a way to get around the bars to the west of the boulder. Since the agent is at (37,9), perhaps moving north to (37,8), then west to (36,8), then north again to (36,7), creating a path to push the boulder west. 

Alternatively, the agent could try to use the stairs up at westnorthwest to go to a different level, but the priority is pushing the boulder onto the fountain. 

Another idea: since the fountain is adjacent northwest, maybe the agent can move northwest around the bars to get a position where they can push the boulder towards the fountain. 

But given the current position and the bars layout, the safest bet might be to move the boulder in a direction that avoids the bars. For example, push it north if possible. 

Wait, the boulder is at (38,9). If the agent moves to (38,9) and tries to push north, that would be (38,8). The language observation says bars adjacent southeast and south at the agent's current position (37,9), but not sure about (38,8). If there are no bars there, pushing north could work. 

Alternatively, the agent could move north from (37,9) to (37,8), then east to (38,8), then push north to move the boulder to (38,7). But this requires checking for bars. 

Given the limited information from the observations, the best immediate action might be to try pushing the boulder in a different direction that's not blocked by bars. Since pushing west is blocked, maybe pushing north or south. 

But the latest message when trying to push west was ""You cannot pass through the bars."" So the bars are in the way. The agent needs to find an open path. 

Perhaps moving the agent to the northwest of the boulder to push it west. To do that, the agent needs to move north and west. For example, from (37,9), move north to (37,8), then west to (36,8), then north to (36,7), then east to (37,7), positioning to push the boulder west. 

But this requires navigating around the bars. Alternatively, since the stairs are nearby at westnorthwest, maybe moving towards them to find a different route. 

Overall, the agent needs to maneuver the boulder away from the bars and towards the fountain. The next logical step is to attempt pushing the boulder in a direction that's not blocked, such as north or east, but given the current position and obstacles, the best bet might be to move the agent into a position where they can push the boulder west around the bars. 

Alternatively, since the boulder is adjacent east, maybe the agent can move north or south relative to the boulder to create a path. For example, move the agent to (38,8) (north of the boulder) and then push west. But to get there, the agent needs to move north from (37,9) to (37,8), then east to (38,8). If that's possible, then pushing west from there could work. 

In conclusion, the best action is to move the agent east to get alongside the boulder, then push it west if possible. However, given the bars, the agent might need to reposition. The immediate action could be to move north to clear a path.

Let's see. The agent is stuck trying to push a boulder west but keeps hitting bars. The map shows several obstacles, especially bars in various directions. The boulder is adjacent to the east, so maybe the agent needs to move around it.

Looking at the observations, the agent is at (37, 9). The boulder is to the east (since the cursor says ""boulder adjacent east""). The goal is to push the boulder onto a fountain. There's a fountain to the west adjacent. So the plan is to push the boulder west towards that fountain.

But the agent tried pushing west before and got a ""You cannot pass through the bars"" message. That suggests there are bars blocking the way. Let me check the map again. The map shows `##{@.##.`#` in the relevant area. The `@` is the agent, and the `.` might be the boulder. The bars are likely represented by `#` or other symbols. The bars are adjacent southeast and south in some observations.

Wait, in the current map, the line is `##{@.##.`#` — perhaps the `#` symbols are bars. So when the agent tries to push west, the boulder is next to a bar, making it impossible to move past. Maybe the boulder is stuck between the agent and the bars. Alternatively, there might be bars directly behind the boulder, preventing it from being pushed further west.

The agent needs to find a way to navigate around the bars. Since the boulder is adjacent east, perhaps moving north or south around the boulder and then pushing it west. Let's see the current position (37,9). Moving north to (37,8) or south to (37,10) might allow the agent to get behind the boulder.

Looking at the language observations, there are bars adjacent southeast and south. So moving south from (37,9) to (37,10) might get into a position where the agent can push the boulder west. Alternatively, moving north to (37,8) could avoid the immediate bars. Then, after repositioning, the agent can attempt to push the boulder west again.

Another possibility is that the agent needs to place the boulder next to the fountain. The fountain is adjacent west, so pushing the boulder one space west would place it on the fountain. However, the presence of bars is blocking that path. Therefore, the agent must first navigate past the bars either by moving around them or finding a way to remove them, but since it's a Sokoban-like game, probably just moving around.

So the next logical step is to move south to (37,10) to get a clear path west of the boulder. Then, push the boulder west towards the fountain. Alternatively, move north first. Let me check the map again. The map shows `##...` at position 3 in the line for y=9. The agent is at x=37, y=9. The boulder is to the east (x=38, y=9). The bars are to the southeast and south, so moving south might clear those bars.

So, first move south to (37,10), then attempt to push the boulder west. Alternatively, move north to (37,8) and then push west. Need to see which direction is clear. In the current observation, the agent's position is (37,9), and the boulder is at (38,9). The bars adjacent southeast and south would be at (38,10) and (37,10) maybe. So moving south to (37,10) would take the agent to a position where they can push the boulder west without hitting the bars. Then, pushing west from (37,10) would move the boulder to (38,10), which might be clear or towards the fountain.

Alternatively, the fountain is adjacent west at (36,9). So pushing the boulder from (38,9) to (37,9) would place it on the fountain. But the agent is at (37,9), so the boulder is next to the agent. To push it west, the agent needs to be adjacent. The current state has the boulder at (38,9), adjacent east to the agent. So pushing west would move the boulder to (37,9), which is where the agent is. That's not possible. Therefore, the agent must move one space west first to be adjacent to the boulder's new position.

Wait, no. In Sokoban, to push a boulder, the agent must be next to it and the space behind the boulder must be free. So the agent is at (37,9), boulder at (38,9). To push west, the agent needs to move into the boulder's space, which would require the space at (39,9) to be free. But there are bars at (39,9), so that's blocked. Hence, the agent cannot push the boulder west directly because the path is blocked by bars.

Therefore, the agent needs to move in a direction that allows the boulder to be pushed west without hitting the bars. Perhaps moving north or south to create a path. Let's see:

If the agent moves north to (37,8), then the boulder is at (38,9). The agent can then move west to (37,9), but that's where they were before. Alternatively, move south to (37,10), then move west to (37,9), and then push the boulder west to (38,9), but that's back to the original position. Hmm, not helpful.

Wait, maybe the agent needs to move around the boulder. For example, move south to (37,10), then move west to (36,10), allowing the boulder to be pushed into that position. But the boulder is at (38,9), so moving the agent to (37,10) and then west isn't directly helpful.

Alternatively, move north to (37,8), then east to (38,8), then south to (38,9), which is the boulder's position. But that's moving into the boulder, which isn't allowed unless pushing.

This is getting a bit confusing. Let's recap:

- Agent is at (37,9)
- Boulder is at (38,9) (east of agent)
- The goal is to push the boulder to the fountain at (36,9) (west of agent)
- Bars are blocking the path to the west of the boulder at (39,9) and possibly other areas.

So the agent needs to find a way to move the boulder from (38,9) to (37,9) (onto the fountain at (36,9)). But to do that, the agent must first be adjacent to the boulder in the correct direction, and the space behind the boulder must be clear.

The problem is that the space at (39,9) is blocked by bars. Therefore, the agent cannot push the boulder further west directly. The solution is to move the boulder around the bars. For example, push the boulder north or south around the bars and then west.

Looking at the map, the agent is in a corridor with bars to the south and southeast. If the agent can push the boulder south to (38,10), then perhaps the path west would be clear. Let's check the bars' positions. The language observation mentions bars adjacent southeast and south. So at (38,10) and (37,10), there might be bars. If moving the boulder south to (38,10), but there are bars there, that wouldn't work.

Alternatively, move the boulder north to (38,8). But are there bars north of the boulder? The map shows `##...` at y=9, which might mean that north of y=9 (y=8) there's a different layout. The agent's current y=9, and moving north to y=8. The map line for y=8 is `##...` so perhaps it's open. If the agent can push the boulder north to (38,8), then move west around the bars.

But how? Let's think step by step.

1. Agent is at (37,9), boulder at (38,9).
2. Move agent north to (37,8).
3. Move agent east to (38,8) (now adjacent to the boulder at (38,9)).
4. Push boulder north to (38,8) → but the agent is already there. Wait, no. To push the boulder north, the agent needs to be north of it. So after moving to (38,8), the agent can push the boulder north to (38,7), but we need to check if that's clear.

Alternatively, from (37,9), move north to (37,8), then west to (36,8), then south to (36,9), which is the fountain. But that doesn't involve the boulder.

This is tricky. Maybe the correct approach is to move around the boulder to the south. Let's say:

1. Agent moves south to (37,10).
2. Then moves west to (36,10).
3. Now, the boulder is at (38,9). The agent is at (36,10).
4. The agent can then move south to (36,9), which is the fountain, but the boulder is at (38,9). Not helpful.

Alternatively, after moving to (37,10), the agent can move east to (38,10), then push the boulder south to (38,9), but that's where it already is.

Hmm. Maybe the agent needs to use a different strategy. Given the recurring issue of bars blocking the path, perhaps the boulder needs to be positioned such that when pushed, it moves around the bars. For example, push the boulder south to a position where there are no bars, then west.

Looking at the language observation, the stairs up are near westsouthwest. The agent's position is (37,9), and westsouthwest would be (35,8) perhaps. Not sure. Alternatively, the agent needs to find a clear path west of the boulder.

Another idea: The agent is at (37,9), boulder at (38,9). To push the boulder west, the agent needs to be west of the boulder, and the space west of the boulder must be clear. The space at (39,9) is blocked by bars, so the agent cannot push the boulder west directly. Therefore, the agent must move the boulder in a direction that allows it to be pushed west around the bars.

For example, push the boulder south to (38,10), then west to (37,10), then north to (37,9), placing it on the fountain. But first, check if there are bars at (38,10). The language observation says bars very near eastnortheast, east, southwest, west, and westnorthwest. That might include (38,10). If there are bars there, pushing the boulder south is blocked.

Alternatively, push the boulder north to (38,8). If the north side is clear, then the agent can move north, push the boulder north, then west.

Looking at the map line for y=8: `##...` which might mean open spaces. So from (38,9), pushing north to (38,8) is possible if there are no bars there. The agent would need to move to (38,8) and push the boulder north.

But how to get the agent to (38,8)? 

1. Agent at (37,9) moves north to (37,8).
2. Moves east to (38,8) (adjacent to boulder at (38,9)).
3. Push boulder north to (38,8). Wait, but the agent is already at (38,8). To push the boulder north, the agent needs to move into it. So the agent would move into (38,9) (the boulder's current position), then the boulder would move to (38,8). But the agent is already moving into the boulder, which isn't allowed unless pushing.

This is getting complicated. Maybe the best move is to try pushing west again, even if it hits bars, but the agent already tried that and got the message. So perhaps the agent needs to reposition.

Given the time the agent has spent without progress, maybe the best action is to move north to (37,8) to explore that path and see if it leads to a way to push the boulder west around the bars.

75,push east,"<reasoning>
Let's see. I'm stuck in Boxoban, trying to push a boulder into a fountain. The map has a bunch of bars blocking paths, and there's a boulder near me. My goal is to get that boulder onto the fountain.

Looking at the current observation, I'm at position (37, 9). The boulder is adjacent to the southeast, which is probably where I need to push it. The fountain is also mentioned to be adjacent to the northwest. Wait, the cursor's position is (37,9), so moving west would take me to (36,9). The boulder is to the east, but there's a bar adjacent to the southeast. Wait, the message says ""bars adjacent southeast and south"". So I can't go east or south directly because of the bars.

The inventory shows I have some healing potions and food, but the main task is moving the boulder. The previous actions tried pushing west but failed because of bars. Maybe I need to navigate around the bars to get to the boulder. Let me check the map again. 

The map has a lot of '#' which represent bars or walls. The boulder is marked with '@' at (38,9) based on the previous map. Wait, in the last map, the agent is at (38, y=9) with the boulder at (38,9) adjacent east. Wait, no, the map shows the agent as '<' at (38, y=9) and the boulder with '@' next to it. So the boulder is to the east of the agent. But there's a bar adjacent southeast and south. So moving east into the boulder might be possible if there's space behind it. 

Wait, the message says ""You cannot pass through the bars"" when trying to go north. So north is blocked by bars. The boulder is to the east, but moving east is blocked by bars adjacent southeast. Hmm. Maybe I need to move west to get around the bars and then approach the boulder from another direction. 

Looking at the cursor position (37,9), moving west to (36,9) might clear the path. From there, maybe I can go north or east. But the bars are still present. Alternatively, pushing the boulder west when it's adjacent. But how? If the boulder is at (38,9), and I'm at (37,9), pushing west would require moving the boulder to (37,9), but I'm already there. Wait, maybe I need to move the boulder south or north if possible. 

The fountain is adjacent northwest, which is to the west-northwest direction. So if I can move the boulder towards the northwest, that would be ideal. But the current position of the boulder is east of me, and the bars are blocking east and south. Maybe I need to move the boulder south first, but there's a bar adjacent south, so that's not possible. 

Alternatively, perhaps I can move north around the bars. But the message says north is blocked by bars. So maybe the only way is to go west, then maybe north or east from there. Let me try to plan the steps:

1. Move west to (36,9) to get away from the bars.
2. From there, check if I can move north or east towards the boulder.
3. Once mobile, push the boulder in the desired direction towards the fountain.

But according to the latest observation, after moving west to (37,9), the boulder is still at (38,9) (since when the agent was at (38,9), the boulder was adjacent east). Now the agent is at (37,9), so the boulder is east. The bars are adjacent southeast and south, so moving east into the boulder would require pushing it west. But can I do that?

Wait, in Boxoban, you push by moving into the boulder, and it moves if there's space behind. So if the boulder is at (38,9) and I'm at (37,9), moving east would push the boulder to (39,9) if that space is free. But the problem is whether (39,9) is passable. The language observation mentions bars near eastnortheast, etc., but not specifically at (39,9). However, the map shows '...' in some areas, which might be open paths. 

Alternatively, maybe the boulder needs to be pushed towards the fountain at northwest. The fountain is at (37,8) perhaps? If I can push the boulder west-northwest, that could work. But the current position of the boulder is east of the agent. To push it west, the agent would need to be to the east of the boulder, which they are. So moving east into the boulder would push it west. Then, from there, perhaps continue pushing it further west towards the fountain.

But the issue is the bars. The bars adjacent southeast and south mean that moving east or south is blocked. So pushing the boulder east isn't possible because there's a bar to the southeast. Wait, the agent is at (37,9), the boulder is at (38,9). If the agent moves east (to 38,9), which is the boulder's position, that would push the boulder to (39,9). But is (39,9) blocked? The map shows '...' in some areas, which are likely open. The bars are far eastsoutheast, so maybe (39,9) is clear. 

However, the language observation says ""bars very near eastnortheast, east, southeast, and westnorthwest"". So eastnortheast might be (38,10), which is north of the boulder. So (39,9) might be clear. If that's the case, pushing the boulder east (agent moves east into it) would be possible. Then, from (38,9), the agent could move west to push it further, or north/south if possible.

But the previous attempts to push west resulted in errors, possibly because the boulder couldn't be moved in that direction due to blocks. Let me check the latest message: ""You cannot pass through the bars."" That happened when trying to go north. So north is blocked by bars. But east might be possible if the boulder can be moved there.

So the next action should be to try pushing the boulder east. Since the agent is at (37,9) and the boulder is at (38,9), moving east into the boulder would push it to (39,9). Assuming that space is clear (no bars mentioned there), this could work. Then, from (38,9), the agent can continue pushing the boulder west towards the fountain.

Therefore, the chosen action is to push east.

The agent is trying to solve a Boxoban-like puzzle where they need to push boulders onto fountains. The current position is (37, 9), and there are some bars blocking movement. The latest attempts to push a boulder west resulted in errors because the agent tried to push against bars, which isn't allowed. The map shows a boulder at (38, 10) initially, but after moving around, the boulder might have moved. The agent needs to navigate around the bars to reach a position where they can push a boulder towards a fountain.

Looking at the current observation, the agent is at (37,9). The bars are adjacent to the north, northeast, and northwest. The nearest boulder seems to be at (38,9) based on the previous map, but after some movements, it might have been pushed. The fountains are adjacent to the west and southeast. The stairs up are westsouthwest, which might be a way to exit, but the goal is to push boulders onto fountains.

The agent needs to find a path to a boulder that isn't blocked by bars. Since pushing west against bars isn't working, maybe moving east or north/south could lead to a different boulder. Alternatively, moving towards the fountain adjacent to the west might be a good direction if a boulder can be pushed there.

Wait, the language observation mentions a boulder very near eastsoutheast. So maybe there's a boulder at (37,10) or nearby. If the agent moves east to (38,9), which was previously a position with a boulder, perhaps they can push it west towards the fountain west of (38,9). But the current map shows a boulder at (38,9) as part of the map's static elements. Wait, the map symbol '<' is the agent, and '@' might be a boulder. Looking at the map:

In the map section, the line for y=9 is ##{@.##.`#. So at x=38, y=9, there's a '{', which might be a different object. Wait, maybe the boulder is at (38,10) based on previous steps. The initial map had a boulder near eastnortheast, which could be at (38,9). But after moving around, the boulder's position might have changed.

Alternatively, the agent needs to check the surroundings for movable objects. The message says ""You cannot pass through the bars,"" so the agent is trying to push against a bar, which isn't possible. The valid actions should be moving to adjacent squares that aren't blocked by bars or pushing boulders into unoccupied or fountain squares.

Given that the agent is at (37,9) and the fountains are adjacent to the west, maybe moving west to (36,9) and then pushing the boulder east towards the fountain. But the boulder's current position needs to be identified. From the map, at (38,9) there's a '{' which could be a fountain or another obstacle. The static map elements might have '#' as walls, '.' as floors, '{' as fountains, '<' as the agent, and '@' as boulders.

Wait, in the initial map, there's a line with #<.{@.{..# which might indicate a boulder (@) at position (38, 10) in the initial map. But after moving north, south, etc., the boulder's position might have changed. The agent needs to locate the boulders and move them towards fountains.

Looking at the current cursor position (37,9), and the map line for y=9: ##{@.##.`# — so at x=38, y=9, there's a '{', which is a fountain. The boulder might be adjacent to that. If the agent can move east to (38,9) and then push west into the fountain, that would solve the problem. But the agent is already at (37,9), so moving east to (38,9) and then pushing west towards the fountain at (38,9) might work. However, the message says ""You cannot pass through the bars,"" which are adjacent to the agent's current position. So perhaps the bars are blocking the path to the boulder.

Alternatively, the agent needs to find a different path. Since pushing west is blocked by bars, maybe moving north or south to get around the bars and then approach the boulder. The agent previously tried moving north but got a ""cannot pass through bars"" message. The same issue occurs when moving north again.

Alternatively, the agent could move south to y=10, where there's a staircase up. Maybe moving south to y=10 and then east or west to find a boulder. The initial position at (38,10) had a boulder. If the agent moves south to (38,10), they might be able to push the boulder west towards the fountain west of that position.

But the current cursor position is (37,9). Moving east to (38,9), which has a '{' (fountain), but no boulder. The boulder might be at (38,10). So the agent needs to move to (38,10) and then push west. To get there, move east to (38,9), then north to (38,10). At (38,10), there's a boulder (from the initial map's @ symbol). Then push west into the fountain at (38,9).

But the current observation's map shows at y=10, the line is ##...`#..# — no boulder visible. Hmm, maybe the boulder has moved. Alternatively, the agent needs to re-examine the map.

Wait, the initial map had a boulder near eastnortheast, which might be at (38,9) or (38,10). After moving around, the boulder's position might have changed. The agent's goal is to push all boulders onto fountains. If there's a boulder at (38,10), pushing it west to (38,9) where there's a fountain would solve the puzzle. But the agent is currently at (37,9). To reach (38,10), they need to move east to (38,9), then north to (38,10). However, moving north from (38,9) might be blocked by bars.

Looking at the language observation, bars are very near north, northeast, and northwest of the agent's current position. So moving north is blocked. Therefore, the agent can't go north from (37,9). They have to go south, east, or west. Moving east to (38,9), which is adjacent to a fountain. Then from there, move north to (38,10) if possible. But the bars are very near north, so maybe moving north from (38,9) is blocked. Alternatively, the agent can try to push the boulder from (38,10) west to (38,9) if they can reach there.

Alternatively, the agent should look for the boulder's current position. The language observation mentions a boulder very near eastsoutheast. Eastsoutheast from (37,9) would be (38,10). So the boulder is at (38,10). The agent needs to move to (38,10) and push west. To get there, from (37,9), move east to (38,9), then north to (38,10). But moving north from (38,9) might be blocked by bars. The language observation says bars are very near north, northeast, and northwest of the agent's current position (37,9). So from (38,9), moving north would be towards (38,8), which might be blocked by bars.

This is getting a bit confusing. Let me recap:

- Agent is at (37,9).
- Bars are adjacent to north, northeast, and northwest.
- There's a boulder very near eastsoutheast (which is (38,10)).
- The goal is to push that boulder onto a fountain.

The agent needs to reach (38,10) to push the boulder. To get there from (37,9):

1. Move east to (38,9).
2. Move north to (38,10). But is that path blocked? The bars are very near north of (37,9), which might mean that (38,8) is blocked. So moving north from (38,9) to (38,10) might be possible if there's no bar there.

Alternatively, maybe the bars are only in certain directions. The language observation says ""bars very near north, northeast, and northwest"" from (37,9), so moving direction north from (37,9) is blocked, but moving north from (38,9) might be allowed if there's no bar there.

Assuming that moving north from (38,9) is possible, the agent can go to (38,9) and then north to (38,10), where the boulder is. Once there, push west into the fountain at (38,9).

But the current map shows at y=10, the line is ##...`#..# — which at x=38 is a '.' (floor), not a boulder. Hmm, maybe the boulder has moved. Alternatively, the agent's previous actions might have moved the boulder.

Alternatively, the agent should check the inventory to see if there are anyitems that can help, but the inventory doesn't seem to include tools for moving bars, only pushing boulders.

Given the constraints, the best action is to move east to (38,9) and then try to push the boulder west towards the fountain. If moving north from (38,9) is blocked, then the agent can't reach (38,10) and needs to find another path.

Another approach: since the agent is at (37,9) and there's a fountain adjacent to the west (at (36,9)), maybe there's a boulder nearby that can be pushed east into that fountain. The language observation mentions a boulder very near eastsoutheast, which is (38,10). But if the boulder is at (38,10), pushing it west would move it to (38,9), which is a fountain. So the agent needs to pathfind to (38,10) and push west.

But how to get there? From (37,9), move east to (38,9), then check if moving north is possible. If bars are blocking, maybe move south first. From (37,9), move south to (37,10). The map at y=10 is ##...`#..#, which at x=37 is a '.' (floor). So moving south is possible. Then from (37,10), move east to (38,10), where the boulder is. Then push west to (38,9), the fountain.

This seems like a possible path. So the sequence would be:

1. south to (37,10)
2. east to (38,10)
3. push west to (38,9)

But need to check if (38,10) has a boulder. The initial map had a '@' at (38,10), so assuming it's still there. The current map's y=10 line is ##...`#..#, which at x=38 is a '.', so maybe the boulder has moved. Alternatively, the '@' might not be showing in the current map because of the way the map is rendered.

Given the uncertainty, the safest valid action is to move in a direction that isn't blocked by bars. Since moving north is blocked, moving south to (37,10) is possible. Then from there, move east to (38,10) and attempt to push west.

But the agent needs to output a single action. Given the current position (37,9) and the blocks, the immediate valid action could be moving south to (37,10) to explore further. Alternatively, moving east to (38,9) and then attempting to push west if there's a boulder there.

Wait, the language observation mentions a boulder very near eastsoutheast, which is (38,10). So the boulder is at (38,10). The agent needs to get there. From (37,9), moving east to (38,9), then north to (38,10). But moving north from (38,9) might be blocked by bars. The language observation says bars are very near north of (37,9), which could mean that (38,8) is blocked, but (38,10) is two steps north, which might be unblocked.

Alternatively, maybe the bars are only in specific directions. The observation says ""bars very near north, northeast, and northwest"" from (37,9), so moving north from (37,9) is blocked, but moving north from (38,9) might be possible.

Assuming that's the case, the agent can move east to (38,9), then north to (38,10), and push west. So the next action should be 'north' to move from (38,9) to (38,10). But the agent is currently at (37,9), so first move east to (38,9), then north.

But the agent has to choose one action at a time. So the first step is to move east to (38,9). Once there, then move north, then push west.

Given the current step, the agent is at (37,9) and needs to choose an action. The best immediate action is to move east to (38,9), which is adjacent and not blocked by bars (since the bars are to the north, northeast, and northwest of (37,9), which are different directions). Moving east should be possible.

So the chosen action is 'east'.

77,push west,"<reasoning>
Let's see. I need to push a boulder onto a fountain in Boxoban. The agent is currently at (38,9). There's a boulder at (38,9) since the cursor shows ""boulder very near southsoutheast"". Looking at the map, the agent is near some bars and a fountain is adjacent to the northwest.

First, I should check the surroundings. The agent tried pushing west before but hit bars. Maybe the boulder is stuck behind something. The map shows `##{@.##.`#` which might mean the boulder is at the position where the agent is trying to move. Wait, the cursor is at (38,9) and the boulder is very near southsoutheast. So maybe the boulder is to the southeast of the agent.

To push the boulder, the agent needs to face it and move in the direction opposite to where the boulder is. If the boulder is southeast, the agent should push it north or west. But the agent is at (38,9), and the boulder is southeast, so maybe the boulder is at (38,10) or (39,9). The map shows `##...`#..#` which could indicate the boulder's location. Alternatively, the `@` is the agent, and the `.` might be the boulder.

Wait, the map line is `##{@.##.`#`. The `@` is at position (38,9), and the `.` after that could be the boulder. So the boulder is to the east of the agent. Therefore, to push it, the agent needs to move west into it. But earlier attempts to push west resulted in ""You cannot pass through the bars."" So maybe there's a bar blocking the path. The bars are very near east, so pushing the boulder west might not be possible because the path is blocked by bars.

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to move the boulder south or north. Let me check the map again. The fountain is adjacent to the northwest, which is (37,8). The agent is at (38,9). The boulder is southeast, so perhaps pushing it north towards the fountain. But the agent's current position is (38,9), so pushing the boulder north would require moving the agent north, but there's a bar there. The message says ""You cannot pass through the bars"" when moving north.

Hmm. The agent needs to find a way to move the boulder around the bars. The stairs up are near westsouthwest, which is (36,8). Maybe moving the boulder towards the stairs isn't helpful. The key is to get the boulder onto the fountain adjacent to northwest. So the fountain is at (37,8). The agent is at (38,9). To reach the fountain, the boulder needs to be pushed to (37,8) or nearby.

Wait, the boulder is very near southsoutheast. If the agent is at (38,9), southsoutheast would be (39,10). Maybe the boulder is at (39,10). To push it north to (39,9), which is adjacent to the fountain at (37,8). But how to get there without hitting the bars. The bars are near eastnortheast, east, southeast, etc. So moving east from the agent's position is blocked by bars. Maybe the agent needs to go around the bars by moving west first. But moving west hits bars. 

Alternatively, perhaps the agent should move south to (38,10) and then try to push the boulder west. Let me check the map. The map line at y=10 is `##..###..#`, which might have obstacles. If the agent moves south to y=10, then tries to push west, maybe the path is clearer. But the previous attempt to push west resulted in a bar blocking. 

Alternatively, check the language observation: ""fountain adjacent northwest"". The agent's current position is (38,9), so northwest is (37,8). There's a fountain there. The boulder needs to be pushed there. The current boulder is very near southsoutheast, which is (39,10) maybe. To get it to (37,8), the agent would need to path around, but obstacles are bars. 

Perhaps the correct action is to move the boulder north towards the fountain. If the boulder is at (39,10), pushing it north to (39,9) would get it closer. Then from there, push it northwest to (38,8), but that's blocked by the fountain's position. Wait, the fountain is at (37,8), so maybe pushing the boulder to (38,8) and then northwest to (37,8). But how to navigate around the bars. 

Alternatively, the agent could try to move east around the bars, but that's blocked. Maybe the best approach is to push the boulder west into a position where it can then be pushed north towards the fountain. But earlier attempts to push west hit bars. 

Wait, the agent is at (38,9). If the boulder is at (38,10), then pushing it north would go to (38,9), but the agent is already there. So that's not possible. Maybe the boulder is at (39,9), and pushing it west to (38,9), but the agent is there. So that's not possible. 

This is confusing. Maybe the agent needs to move south to y=10, then try to push the boulder west. Let's see. The map at y=10 is `##..###..#`, which might have obstacles. If the agent moves south to (38,10), then tries to push west, maybe the path is clear. But the language observation says ""bars very near eastnortheast, east, southeast, and westnorthwest"". So moving west from (38,10) might hit a bar. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent should move north to y=8, but that's blocked by bars. The only feasible move might be to push the boulder east, but that's blocked by bars. 

Wait, the message says ""You cannot pass through the bars"" when trying to move north or west. So perhaps the only way is to push the boulder south. If the boulder is at (38,10), pushing it south to (38,11) might be possible if there's no obstacle. But the map doesn't show anything there. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent should look for an alternative path. The stairs are up near westsouthwest, which is (36,8). Maybe moving the boulder towards there isn't helpful. The main goal is to get the boulder onto the fountain at (37,8). 

Another approach: since the fountain is adjacent northwest, the agent could push the boulder to (37,9) and then north to (37,8). But how to get there. The agent is at (38,9). To get the boulder to (37,9), the agent needs to push it west. But previous attempts to push west hit bars. 

Wait, maybe the bars are at certain positions. The language observation mentions ""bars very near eastnortheast, east, southeast, and westnorthwest"". So moving east from the agent's position (38,9) is blocked by bars. Moving west hits bars. Moving north is blocked. Moving south might be possible. 

If the agent moves south to (38,10), then tries to push the boulder west, maybe the path is clear. Let me check the map at y=10: `##..###..#`. The agent is at (38,9), moving south to (38,10) would be into `.` which is the boulder? Or is the boulder at (38,10)? The map shows `##{@.##.`#` for y=9, so the `@` is at (38,9), and the `.` is next, so the boulder is at (38,10). So pushing it west would require moving to (38,9), but the agent is already there. That doesn't make sense. 

Alternatively, the boulder is at (39,10). Then pushing it north to (39,9) would allow moving it towards the fountain. But the agent is at (38,9), so pushing the boulder north from (39,10) would require the agent to be at (39,10), which they are not. 

This is getting complicated. Maybe the best action is to move the agent to the position of the boulder and then push it in the correct direction. Since the agent is at (38,9) and the boulder is very near southsoutheast (which would be (39,10)), the agent needs to move east to (39,9) or south to (38,10) to get next to the boulder. 

Moving east to (39,9) is blocked by bars, according to the language observation. So moving south to (38,10) might be possible. If the agent moves south, then they can try to push the boulder west. 

So the actions could be: south, then push west. Let's check if moving south is allowed. The previous attempts to move north and west were blocked, but moving south might be possible if there's no obstacle. The map at y=10 shows `##..###..#`, which might have `.`s indicating open passages. So moving south to (38,10) is possible. Then, from there, push west to move the boulder. 

But how to confirm. The agent's current position is (38,9). Moving south to (38,10) is into a `.` on the map, which might be the boulder. Wait, the map line at y=9 is `##{@.##.`#`, so the agent is at (38,9), and the next character is `.`, which could be the boulder. So the boulder is at (38,10). Therefore, the agent is adjacent to the boulder to the south. So to push the boulder, the agent needs to move north into it. But moving north is blocked by bars. 

This is confusing. Maybe the correct action is to push the boulder south. If the boulder is at (38,10), pushing it south to (38,11) might be possible. But the language observation doesn't mention obstacles there. 

Alternatively, the agent should move west around the bars. But previous attempts to move west hit bars. 

Given the constraints, the most feasible action might be to push the boulder east, but that's blocked. So perhaps the agent should try to move south, then push west. 

Wait, the agent is at (38,9). Moving south to (38,10) would be onto the boulder. So to push the boulder, the agent needs to move into it from the direction it's facing. If the agent is facing south, moving into the boulder (which is at (38,10)) would push it to (38,11). But is there a path there? The map at y=11 is unclear, but the language observation doesn't mention obstacles south of there. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent should move north again, but it's blocked by bars. 

Given all this, the best action might be to push the boulder west despite the bars, but the system said it's not possible. Maybe the correct action is to move south first to get next to the boulder, then push west. 

So the sequence would be: south, then push west. Let's try that.

Let's try to figure out what to do next here. The agent is in a box-pushing game, Boxoban. The goal is to push boulders onto fountains. The current observation shows the agent's position at (38, 9) after several movements. The map has a lot of bars (obstacles) and a boulder adjacent to the east. There's also a fountain nearby to the west and southwest.

Looking at the previous actions, the agent tried pushing west but couldn't because of the bars. The message says ""You cannot pass through the bars,"" which means those bars are solid obstacles. The boulder is at (38,9) east, so pushing it west would require moving it towards the fountain at west or southwest. But the agent is currently at (38,9), and the boulder is adjacent east. So to push the boulder west, the agent needs to position themselves to the west of the boulder and then push it.

The last valid action was moving east to (38,9), and the boulder is adjacent east. So the agent is next to the boulder. The problem is the bars blocking the path when trying to push. The bars are in various directions, but the immediate obstacle for pushing west would be the bars very near east, northeast, southeast, and westnorthwest according to the language observation.

Wait, the language observation says ""bars very near eastnortheast, east, southeast, and westnorthwest."" So the agent's current position (38,9) has bars to the east, eastnortheast, southeast, and westnorthwest. But the boulder is adjacent east. So pushing the boulder west would require moving it into an empty space, but perhaps there's a bar in the way that wasn't clearly mapped. Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to move around the bars first to get a clear path to push the boulder.

Alternatively, maybe the agent should try pushing the boulder in a different direction. The fountain is to the southwest and west. If the boulder can be pushed west towards the fountain at (38,8) or similar, that would solve the problem. But the agent is at (38,9), and the boulder is at (39,9). To push it west to (38,8), the agent needs to be at (38,9) and move west, but the bars might be blocking the way. The bars are very near east, so the agent's eastern direction is blocked, but west should be possible if there's no bar there.

Wait, the bars very near include westnorthwest, which is a bit to the northwest of the agent. The agent's current position is (38,9). To push the boulder west to (38,8), the agent needs to be adjacent to it and push. The problem might be that there's a bar in (38,8), blocking the path. The map shows some ###...# which might represent walls or bars. Looking at the map, the agent's current row (9th row) has ""##{.@##.`#"". The '.' might be a floor, but the '#' are bars. The agent's position is at the '@' which is in the third position of that row. The boulder is adjacent east, so in position (39,9), which is part of the ""##."" in the next part of the map. Wait, the map might be structured such that each row is a line. Let me try to parse the map.

The map provided has 9 rows (since the last line is ##########). The agent's position is (38,9), which is in the 9th row. Looking at the 9th row: ""##########"" which is 10 '#' characters. So the agent is at (38,9) which is the middle of that row. But the map's x and y coordinates might be different. Wait, maybe the map is represented with y increasing downwards. So (x=38, y=9) is the 9th row from the top, which is the last row shown here. The row is all '#'s, so that's a solid wall. But the agent is inside that? That seems confusing. Maybe the map has a different structure. Alternatively, perhaps the agent is in a corridor between bars.

This is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to reorient. The agent is at (38,9), and the map's 9th row is all bars. So maybe the agent is in a cell that's surrounded by bars on the south side (since y=9 is the bottom row here). But the agent's position is marked with '@', which is inside the map. The boulder is adjacent east, so in the next cell to the east, which is part of the same row. The bars very near include east, so pushing east isn't possible. But the agent needs to push west towards the fountain.

Alternatively, maybe the agent should move north or south to find a way around the bars. The previous actions tried moving north but hit a bar. The message says ""You cannot pass through the bars,"" so north is blocked. The agent needs to find a direction where there's no bar to push the boulder.

Wait, the boulder is at (39,9). To push it west to (38,8), the agent needs to be at (38,9) and push west. But the cell (38,8) is part of the 9th row, which is all bars. So that's not possible. Therefore, the agent must move the boulder in another direction. Maybe north or south. Let's check the map.

The 8th row is ""##########"", same as the 9th. The 7th row is ""#######`{#"", which has some '#' and a '{' which might be a fountain. The agent's goal is to push the boulder onto a fountain. So if the boulder can be moved to the fountain at (38,7) or similar, that would work. To do that, the agent would need to push the boulder north or south.

But the bars near include eastnortheast, eastsoutheast, etc. The agent's current position is (38,9). To push the boulder north to (39,8), the agent needs to move north-east to get behind the boulder. But the bars are in the way. Alternatively, maybe the agent can move north to (38,8), but that row is all bars. So that's not possible.

This is tricky. The key is to find a direction where the boulder can be pushed without hitting bars. The agent is surrounded by bars on the east, north, and south (since the rows above and below are all bars). The only possible direction might be west, but the cell to the west (38,8) is a bar. Therefore, the agent might need to move the boulder in a different way. Maybe the agent needs to move north or south first to create a path.

Alternatively, perhaps the agent should look for another boulder. The current observation mentions a boulder very near east, which is the one we've been trying to push. Are there other boulders? The initial observations mentioned a boulder near eastnortheast and southeast. Maybe the agent should push that one instead.

Looking back at the language observation: ""boulder very near east"" and ""boulder very near southsoutheast"". The agent is currently next to the eastern boulder. The other boulder is southsoutheast. Maybe the agent should move towards that one. But how?

Alternatively, the agent could try to move southwest towards the fountain. The fountain adjacent southwest. To get there, the agent would need to move west and south, but there are bars blocking the way. The bars very near include westnorthwest, which is to the northwest of the agent. So moving west might be possible if there's a path.

Wait, the agent's current position is (38,9). Moving west to (37,9) is possible if that cell is not a bar. Looking at the map's 9th row: ""##########"", which is all bars. So the agent is in a cell that's surrounded by bars on all sides except maybe east. But the east cell (39,9) has a boulder. So the agent is stuck between bars and a boulder. This seems like a dead end.

In this case, the only possible action might be to try pushing the boulder in a different direction. Since pushing west is blocked by bars, maybe pushing south or north. But the bars are also in those directions. Alternatively, the agent could move around the boulder to the east and push it in another direction. But the agent is already next to the boulder.

Wait, the agent's position is (38,9), and the boulder is at (39,9). To push the boulder east, but that's blocked by bars. To push it north, the agent would need to be at (38,9) and push north into (39,8). But is that cell a bar? The 8th row is all bars, so (39,8) is a bar. Can't push there. Similarly, pushing south to (39,10), but that row isn't shown in the map, so maybe it's a different area.

This is quite confusing. Maybe the agent should try moving north again, hoping that the previous observation was incorrect. Or perhaps there's a way to move west through a different path. Alternatively, the agent might need to find a different boulder to push.

Given the current information, the best bet might be to continue trying to push the boulder west, even though it's not working, but that's not effective. Alternatively, the agent should move north to see if there's a path. But the message says ""You cannot pass through the bars,"" so that's blocked.

Wait, the agent's inventory has a lot of items, but in Boxoban, the usual actions are moving around and pushing boulders. The key is to find a path to the boulder and then push it towards a fountain. Given the current observations, the agent is stuck next to a boulder surrounded by bars. Maybe the solution is to move south to a different part of the map where there's space.

But how to determine that from the given map? The map's 9th row is all bars, so moving south would go into that. Maybe the agent should move north to row 8, but that's also all bars. This seems like a dead end. Perhaps the agent needs to backtrack to a previous position where there were fewer obstacles.

Looking back at the history, the agent moved south initially, then east, north, etc. Maybe the agent should move west again to a previous position with more space. For example, moving west from (38,9) to (37,9), but that cell is part of the 9th row which is all bars. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, the agent might need to use the stairs up near westsouthwest to go to a different level, but that's probably not necessary for the first level.

At this point, it's challenging to determine the exact path, but the most logical action given the current position and the boulder adjacent east is to try pushing the boulder west again, despite the previous failure. Alternatively, maybe the agent should move north-east to position itself to push the boulder in another direction. But without knowing the exact map layout, it's hard to say.

Given the constraints and the previous attempts, the chosen action should be to push the boulder west, even if it results in another failure, but the system might be expecting a different approach. Alternatively, maybe the agent should move north to see if there's a pass through the bars, but the message says it's blocked.

Wait, the agent's previous action was north, which resulted in ""You cannot pass through the bars."" So north is blocked. The agent needs to find another way. The only possible directions are west, east, south. East is blocked by the boulder and bars. South is into the 9th row, which is bars. West is also bars. So the agent is trapped.

In this case, the only possible action is to do nothing, but the game probably requires continuous movement. Therefore, the agent might need to restart the level or find a different path. But given the information, the best action is to try pushing the boulder west again, even though it's not working, or move in another direction if possible.

But according to the problem statement, the agent should not repeat the same action if nothing changes. The previous actions included multiple attempts to push west and east, but they haven't succeeded. The agent needs to try a different action. Maybe moving north is blocked, but perhaps there's a different path.

Alternatively, the agent could try to move southwest towards the fountain. To do that, it would need to move west and south. But moving west from (38,9) is blocked by bars. Moving south to (38,10) is possible if that cell is not a bar. Looking at the map, the 10th row is not shown, so it's unclear. However, the stairs up are near westsouthwest, which might be in a different area.

Given the ambiguity, the safest bet is to continue trying to push the boulder west, even if it's not working, or to move north again despite the bar. But since moving north didn't work before, maybe the agent should try moving east again to see if there's a different configuration.

Alternatively, the agent could look for another boulder. The language observation mentions a boulder very near east and another near southsoutheast. Maybe the agent should move towards the southsoutheast boulder. To do that, the agent would need to move south and east, but the bars are in the way.

In conclusion, the most plausible action given the current position and the need to push the boulder towards a fountain is to try pushing it west again, despite previous failures. Alternatively, move north to see if there's a different obstacle. However, since north is blocked, the best action is to push west.

Let's try to figure out what to do next. The agent is stuck trying to push a boulder west but can't because of bars. The cursor position is (38,9), and there's a boulder adjacent to the east. The agent tried pushing west before but got an error because of the bars blocking the way.

The current goal in Boxoban is to push all boulders onto fountains. Looking at the observations, there's a fountain near eastsoutheast and another adjacent to northwest. The boulder that's currently at (38,9) is next to the agent, so maybe pushing it east towards the fountain would be better. But the agent tried moving east and north, but the bars are blocking those paths.

The bars are in the way, so maybe the agent needs to find a different path to get around them. The stairs are up near westsouthwest, but going there might not help with the boulders. The dark areas might be out of bounds or obstacles. The agent should check the map layout again. 

Wait, the map shows some symbols like '{', '.', '@', which could be part of the environment. The '@' represents the agent's position. The '#' symbols are likely walls or bars. The agent needs to navigate around these to reach the boulder and push it towards the fountain.

Since pushing west isn't working due to bars, maybe moving the agent east first to get to a position where they can push the boulder south or another direction. But the agent tried east and got a ""You cannot pass through the bars"" message. Maybe the bars are blocking the path east as well.

Alternatively, the agent could try moving north or south to find a way around the bars. Looking at the language observations, there are bars adjacent to northeast, east, and northwest. The agent is at (38,9), so moving north would take them to y=8. The map shows that the ninth row (y=9) has a bar adjacent to the east (the '@' is at (38,9), and east would be (39,9), which might be a bar). 

If the agent moves north to y=8, maybe there's a path that allows them to get around the bars and then push the boulder. Let me check the map again. The ninth row is ""##{.@##.`#"". The '@' is at position 38,9. Moving north to y=8 would be row 8, which is ""#######`.#"". There's a '.' near the end, maybe a floor. So perhaps moving north to (38,8) is possible if there's no obstacle. 

Once the agent is at (38,8), they might have a better path to the east or west. Then they could try pushing the boulder west towards the fountain adjacent to northwest. Or maybe pushing it south towards the fountain near southsoutheast. 

Another option is to move west to (37,9) and then see if pushing the boulder west from there is possible. But earlier attempts showed that the bars are blocking that. 

Alternatively, the agent could try to move south to y=10 and check if there's a way to navigate around the bars. The tenth row is ""##########"", which is all walls or bars, so moving south might not be possible. 

The key is to find a path to get the boulder off its current spot and onto a fountain. Since pushing west is blocked by bars, maybe the agent should push the boulder east towards the fountain near eastsoutheast. But to do that, the agent needs to be adjacent to the boulder and have a clear path east. 

The boulder is at (38,9), adjacent to the agent's position (38,9) east. So if the agent is at (38,9), pushing east would move the boulder to (39,9). But the language observation says there are bars very near eastnortheast, east, etc. So (39,9) might be a bar, preventing the push. 

In that case, the agent needs to find a way to navigate around the bars to either push the boulder in another direction or find a path to a fountain. Maybe moving north to y=8, then east to a position where the boulder can be pushed west towards the fountain at northwest. 

Alternatively, the agent could check if there's a fountain in another direction that's closer. The fountain adjacent to northwest is at (maybe) (36,9), but the agent is at (38,9). If they can push the boulder west twice, but bars are blocking. 

Hmm, this is tricky. The main issue is the bars blocking the agent's movement and the boulder's path. The agent might need to explore other directions, like moving west to (37,9) and then trying to push the boulder from there. But earlier attempts didn't work. 

Wait, the agent's last valid action was 'east' which moved them to (38,9). Then they tried pushing west but failed. Maybe the agent should try moving north to y=8, then see if they can proceed from there. 

So the next step could be moving north to y=8. If that's possible (no bars), then the agent can reposition and try pushing the boulder in a different direction. 

Looking at the map row 8: ""#######`.#"". The position (38,8) is the 9th character, which is a '.', so it's a floor. Therefore, moving north to (38,8) should be possible. 

Once there, the agent could then try moving east or west. If they move east to (39,8), but that's likely a bar. So maybe moving west to (37,8) and then trying to push the boulder from there. 

Alternatively, from (38,8), the agent could try pushing the boulder north, but the map row 7 is all bars, so that's not possible. 

Alternatively, moving south back to y=9, but that doesn't help. 

So the best plan is: move north to (38,8), then move west to (37,8), and then push the boulder west to (36,8) towards the fountain at northwest. But need to check if there are obstacles. 

The agent needs to navigate carefully. The current action should be to move north to escape the bars blocking the west direction. 

So the chosen action is 'north'.

Let's see. The agent is trying to solve Boxoban, pushing boulders onto fountains. The current position is (38,9). The map shows various bars, dark areas, and a boulder near eastnortheast. The goal is to move that boulder onto a fountain.

First, the agent has been trying to push west multiple times but getting blocked by bars. The error messages say ""You cannot pass through the bars,"" so moving directly into those isn't possible. The bars are likely obstacles that the agent can't go through, so they need to find another path around them.

Looking at the map, the agent is at (38,9). The boulder is near eastnortheast, which would be to the northeast direction. The fountains are adjacent to southwest and west. So maybe the boulder needs to be moved westward towards the fountain.

But the agent keeps trying to push west but is blocked by bars. Maybe the bars are in the way, so the agent needs to move around them first. The cursor's position is (38,9), and when moving west, it's hitting bars. Perhaps the agent should move north or south to find a path around the bars, then approach the boulder.

Alternatively, check if there's a way to push the boulder by moving the agent in a different direction. Since pushing requires the agent to be next to the boulder and the space behind it to be unoccupied. The boulder is at eastnortheast, so the agent needs to be adjacent to it to push.

In the current map, the agent is at (38,9). The boulder is near eastnortheast, which would be around (39,8) or (39,10). The agent needs to get next to the boulder to push it. If moving east is blocked by bars, maybe moving north or south first to reposition.

Looking at the bars' positions, the adjacent bars are north, northeast, east, and northwest. So the agent is surrounded on three sides by bars except west and southwest. To get to the boulder, the agent might need to go north or south around the bars.

Let me check the map again. The map shows a lot of '#' which are probably walls or bars. The agent's position is near some '###' which are likely obstacles. The stairs up are near westsouthwest, which is southwest direction. Maybe moving southwest to the stairs isn't helpful right now.

The fountains are adjacent to southwest and west. So perhaps the intended path is to move the boulder towards the west fountain. But the agent is currently at (38,9). The boulder is near eastnortheast, so moving west from there would be towards the agent's current position.

Wait, the boulder near eastnortheast would be at (39,10) or similar. The agent is at (38,9). To push the boulder west, the agent needs to be east of it. So maybe the agent needs to move east first to get next to the boulder, but that's blocked by bars. Hmm.

Alternatively, the boulder very near southeast might be the one to push. The map shows 'boulder very near southeast', which could be at (37,10) or similar. If the agent can move south or east to get next to that boulder, then push it west towards the fountain.

But the agent's current position is (38,9). Moving south would take them to (38,10), but what's there? The map has '##########' which are walls. So moving south might hit a wall. Moving east is blocked by bars. Moving north is also blocked by bars. So the agent is kind of stuck between bars on three sides.

Perhaps the only open direction is west, but that's blocked by bars. The agent needs to find a way around. Maybe moving north or south around the bars. Let's see. The adjacent bars are north, northeast, east, and northwest. So if the agent moves south, they might find a path.

Looking at the map, the line at y=9 has the agent's position. Below that (y=10) is '##..###..#', which might be a path. So moving south to y=10 might be possible if there's no bar. Wait, the language observation says bars are very near eastnortheast, east, southwest, west, and westnorthwest. So maybe moving south is possible.

So the plan could be: move south to y=10, then proceed west or north around the bars to reach the boulder. Alternatively, check if the boulder near southeast can be pushed west.

Another thought: the agent's inventory has a potion of extra healing and other items, but maybe not relevant here. The key is to push the boulder onto the fountain. Since the agent is stuck between bars, perhaps the best action is to try moving in a direction that allows approaching the boulder, even if it requires detouring.

Alternatively, since pushing west isn't working, maybe try pushing east towards the boulder, but that's blocked. Alternatively, move north around the bars to find a path. The bars adjacent are north, so moving north might take the agent into a dark area, but perhaps there's a way through.

Wait, the language observation mentions dark areas far east, southeast, and south. Moving north might enter a darker area, but if there's a path, maybe that's the way. The agent's cursor is at (38,9), so moving north to (38,8). The map at y=8 is '##########', which are walls. So that's not possible.

Moving west to (37,9) was possible earlier, but bars are adjacent there. Hmm. This is tricky. Maybe the agent needs to use a different approach. Perhaps the boulder near southeast can be pushed west. Let's check the map again. The map shows '#<.{..{..#', which might indicate the boulder ('@') near southeast. So the boulder is at (37,10) perhaps.

If the agent can move south to y=10, then east to get next to the boulder at (37,10), then push west to (36,10), which is towards the fountain adjacent to southwest. That might work. So the sequence would be: south, east, push west.

But the agent's current position is (38,9). Moving south to (38,10). The map at y=10 has '##..###..#', which might allow movement. Let me check the map again. The line for y=9 is '##{.@##.`#' where the agent is at position x=38. Moving south to y=10 would be the next line: '##..###..#'. The x=38 position in that line would be the seventh character (since counting starts at 0 or 1?), which is '#', so it's a wall. So moving south is blocked by a wall.

Hmm, that complicates things. So the agent can't move south because there's a wall. Then the only open directions are west, but it's blocked by bars. Maybe the agent needs to find another way. 

Wait, the stairs up are near westsouthwest, which is southwest direction. Maybe moving southwest to the stairs and then up, but that might not help with pushing the boulder. The goal is to push the boulder onto the fountain, so the agent needs to manipulate the boulder's position.

Another possibility: the boulder far southsoutheast. If the agent can move there, but it's far away. The current position is (38,9), and the boulder is far southsoutheast, so maybe at (34,13) or something. That's too far. Not helpful.

Alternatively, the boulder very near southeast. If that's at (37,10), and the agent is at (38,9), maybe moving east to (39,9) is blocked by bars. The language observation says bars are very near eastnortheast, east, etc. So moving east is blocked.

This is quite challenging. The agent is surrounded by bars on three sides and a wall to the south. The only possible movement is west, but it's blocked. Maybe the agent needs to wait for a different action, but the problem is to choose an action now.

Given the constraints, perhaps the best action is to continue trying to push west, but since it's blocked, maybe the agent should move north around the bars. Wait, but moving north is adjacent to bars, so the message says ""You cannot pass through the bars."" So that's not possible.

Alternatively, maybe the agent can move in a different direction that's not directly blocked. For example, moving northwest or northeast, but the language observation says bars are adjacent north, northeast, east, and northwest. So all those directions are blocked.

In that case, the agent might be stuck and needs to find another way, perhaps by using items or waiting, but in Boxoban, the usual solution is to push boulders. Since the agent can't move freely, maybe the correct action is to try a different push direction. But without being adjacent to the boulder, pushing isn't possible.

Wait, maybe the agent is not adjacent to the boulder but can push it by moving into it. For example, if the agent is next to the boulder and moves in the direction of the boulder, pushing it. But the agent needs to be adjacent to the boulder.

Looking at the map, the agent is at (38,9). The boulder very near southeast might be at (37,10). So the agent is one unit west and one unit north of the boulder. To push the boulder west, the agent needs to be east of it. So the agent would need to move east to (39,9), but that's blocked by bars. Hence, unable to get next to the boulder.

This seems like a dead end. The agent might need to find a different path or strategy. Since all direct movements are blocked, perhaps the only option is to move in a direction that allows repositioning, but given the current map layout, that's not possible.

Alternatively, the agent might have to accept that it's stuck and needs to try a different approach, but in the context of the game, the agent should keep trying valid actions. Given the previous attempts to push west resulted in errors, maybe the correct action now is to move north again, even though it's blocked by bars, but that would just repeat the same error.

Alternatively, check if there's a different boulder. The language observation mentions a boulder near eastnortheast and another very near southeast. Maybe the agent should target the southeast one.

But without being able to move east or south, it's hard to reach. Maybe the agent needs to move west to (37,9) and then try to navigate from there. Earlier, moving west from (38,9) to (37,9) was possible, but bars are adjacent there. However, the agent was able to move west again from (37,9) to (36,9) earlier. So perhaps the agent should try moving west again, even if it's blocked by bars, but that would result in the same error.

Wait, in the previous steps, the agent moved west from (38,9) to (37,9), then again to (36,9), then east back to (37,9). So maybe there's a loop here. The agent is moving back and forth between these positions but can't make progress.

Given all this, perhaps the best action the agent can take now is to move north again, even though it's blocked, but the system will default to north if the action is invalid. Alternatively, since the agent is stuck, maybe the correct action is to wait, but in the game, waiting isn't an action here—the available actions are movement.

Alternatively, maybe the agent should try pushing east towards the boulder, but that's blocked by bars. Hmm.

In conclusion, the agent is surrounded by barriers and can't move freely. The only possible valid action might be to move north, even though it's blocked, but the system will default to north. Alternatively, the agent could try moving west again, but that's also blocked. Given the previous invalid actions leading to defaults, perhaps the agent should try a different direction, like south, even though the map shows a wall, but maybe there's a path.

Wait, checking the map again: the agent's current y=9 line is '##{.@##.`#'. The agent is at x=38, which is the eighth character (if counting from 0, index 7 or 8?). Let's count: the string is '##{.@##.`#'. Breaking it down:

0: #
1: #
2: {
3: . 
4: @
5: #
6: ##
7: . 
8: `
9: #

So at x=38, which is index 8 (assuming 0-based), the character is '`'. So moving west to x=37 would be index 7, which is a '.' (floor), so that's possible. Wait, earlier the agent moved west from (38,9) to (37,9) successfully. Then why is the map showing bars adjacent north, northeast, etc.? Maybe the bars are in other areas.

So perhaps the agent can move west again. Let me check the previous observations. After moving west to (37,9), the bars were still adjacent. But the agent was able to move again. So maybe the agent can keep moving west until it finds a path.

In the latest observation, after moving west to (37,9), the bars are still adjacent, but the agent can move west again to (36,9). Let's see what's at (36,9). The map line for y=9 is '##{.@##.`#', so x=36 would be index 5, which is '#', a wall. So moving west from (37,9) to (36,9) is blocked by a wall. Hence, the agent can't move west past (37,9).

Therefore, the agent is stuck between x=37 and x=38 on y=9, with a wall at x=36 and bars to the north, northeast, east, and northwest. The only possible movement is west to x=37, but that's already done, and south is blocked by a wall.

Given this, the agent has no valid moves and might be in a loop. However, the problem requires choosing an action. Since all direct movements are blocked, the only option is to try a different action, perhaps using an item, but the available actions are movement. Therefore, the agent should default to a movement action that was previously valid, like north, even though it's blocked, leading to the same error but not getting stuck in a different loop.

Alternatively, maybe the agent should try pushing the boulder west when adjacent. But without being next to the boulder, that's impossible. The agent needs to reposition to be adjacent to the boulder, but can't due to barriers.

In this case, the best possible action the agent can take is to move north again, as it's the only direction that wasn't tried in the immediate previous steps, even though it's likely to fail. Alternatively, the agent could try moving southwest, but that's not a listed action. The available actions are north, south, east, west, and push actions in those directions.

Since push actions keep getting invalid, the agent should revert to movement actions. Given the previous valid movement was west, but it's now blocked, the agent has to try another direction. The default might be north, but perhaps trying west again is worth it.

But in the latest observation, moving west from (38,9) is blocked by bars. So the agent should not try that again. The only other option is north, which is also blocked. Therefore, the agent is truly stuck and has no valid moves. However, the game probably expects the agent to keep trying, so the best action is to default to north.

",-0.001,False
81,north,"<reasoning>
I need to figure out what action to take next in this Boxoban-like game. Let me look through the observations and messages again.

The agent is at position (38, 9). The message says ""You cannot pass through the bars,"" which probably means there are bars blocking movement in some directions. The bars are mentioned in various directions, especially southsoutheast, south, eastnortheast, and adjacent to the agent's current position. The agent tried pushing west before but couldn't because of the bars. 

The goal is to push boulders onto fountains. Looking at the map, there's a boulder at the far southsoutheast. There's a fountain near the same area. So the objective is to push that boulder towards the fountain. 

The agent is currently facing the bars. Since pushing west isn't working, maybe trying to move around the bars. The map shows a staircase up near westsouthwest, which might be a way out, but the priority is pushing the boulder. 

The boulder is southsoutheast, so the agent needs to move south or southeast to get to it. However, the bars are blocking the path. The agent might need to navigate around the bars to the south or find another route. 

Looking at the cursor position and the map layout, the agent is in a corridor with bars on the north, northeast, east, and northwest. Moving north or east is blocked by bars. South and west might be possible, but there's a boulder in the southsoutheast. 

Wait, the boulder is far southsoutheast. The agent needs to move towards it. Let's see: from (38,9), moving east would take them closer to the boulder, but there are bars near eastnortheast and eastsoutheast. Maybe moving east first, then south? But the bars might block that. 

Alternatively, moving west might take the agent to the stairs up near westsouthwest, but that's not helpful for pushing the boulder. The key is to get to the boulder and push it towards the fountain. 

The agent tried pushing west but failed because of the bars. Maybe the boulder is adjacent to the bars, so pushing it isn't possible in that direction. The agent needs to get to the boulder's position and then find a direction to push it towards the fountain. 

Since the boulder is far southsoutheast, the agent should move southeast. However, the bars are in the southsoutheast direction. Maybe moving south first, then east? But the bars are blocking south. 

Wait, the bars adjacent to the agent are north, northeast, east, and northwest. So the agent can't go north, northeast, or east. The only open directions might be south and west. But south is blocked by bars. 

Looking at the map, there's a `#` symbol which might represent obstacles. The agent is at `{.@##.`#, which could mean the '@' is the agent, and the '##' are bars. So moving west into the bars isn't possible. 

The agent previously moved west to (37,9) and then tried pushing west again but failed. So the bars are solid there. 

Maybe the agent needs to find a different path. Since the stairs are near westsouthwest, perhaps moving west twice to get there, but that's not helpful for the boulder. 

Alternatively, moving south, but the bars are blocking that. The only option might be to move east, but the bars are there too. 

Wait, the agent's inventory has a potion of extra healing and some food. Maybe using an item, but the task is to push boulders, so using items isn't the priority here. 

The agent needs to navigate around the bars to reach the boulder. Since moving east is blocked by bars, maybe moving south around the bars. But the bars are southsoutheast. 

Looking at the map again, the agent is in a room with walls (##########) and bars in various directions. The boulder is at the far southsoutheast, which is likely in another room or corridor. 

The agent's current position is (38,9). To get to the boulder at southsoutheast, they need to move east and then south. But the bars are in the way. Perhaps moving east once to (39,9), but the bars near eastnortheast might block that. 

Wait, the language observation says bars very near eastnortheast, east, southwest, west, and westnorthwest. So moving east from (38,9) would hit the bars. 

This is tricky. The agent might be stuck in a position where they can't move freely due to the bars. The only possible movement might be south or west, but both are blocked. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent should climb or kick the bars, but that's not a listed action. The available actions are north, east, south, west, and push in those directions. 

Since the agent can't push west due to bars, perhaps trying to move south, but that's blocked. Maybe moving west twice to get to the stairs, but that doesn't help with the boulder. 

Wait, the stairs up are near westsouthwest. If the agent moves west twice, they could reach there, but the stairs are probably to go up a level, which isn't necessary right now. 

The main goal is to push the boulder onto the fountain. The boulder is at southsoutheast, and the fountain is there too. The agent needs to get to the boulder's position and push it. 

Since the agent is at (38,9), moving east to (39,9) might be possible if there's no bar there. But the observation says bars very near east, so probably can't. 

Maybe the agent needs to find a way around the north or northeast bars. But those are adjacent. 

Alternatively, the agent could try to push the boulder south or southeast. But to do that, they need to be adjacent to the boulder. 

Given that the agent is blocked in all directions except maybe south or west, but those are also blocked, perhaps the only option is to try pushing in a direction that's not blocked. Wait, the agent tried pushing west but failed. 

Hmm, maybe the agent needs to move south around the bars. If the bars are only in certain parts of the south, the agent could move south and then east. 

But the message says ""You cannot pass through the bars,"" which implies solid barriers. So the agent can't go through them. 

In this case, the agent might be stuck and needs to find another way. Since all movement is blocked except possibly north, but that's also barred. 

Wait, the agent's current position is (38,9). The bars adjacent are north, northeast, east, and northwest. So the only possible movement is south or west, but both are blocked by bars. 

This seems like a dead end. Maybe the agent needs to use a different strategy, like exploring other areas to find a way around. But given the current observations, the agent is in a room with bars surrounding them. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent should use the stairs down or up, but the stairs up are near westsouthwest. Moving west twice to (36,9) and then south might be possible. 

But the agent's previous attempts to move west led them to (37,9) and (36,9), but the bars were still there. 

Wait, at (36,9), the agent could try moving south. If there's no bar there, they could proceed. 

The language observation mentions bars near southsoutheast, south, etc., but it's unclear about the exact positions. 

Alternatively, the agent should try to move south from (38,9) to (38,10). If there's no bar there, that could be a way to proceed. 

But the message says ""You cannot pass through the bars,"" which might apply to all blocked directions. 

Given that all movement directions are blocked by bars except possibly south, which might also be blocked, the agent is trapped. 

In that case, the only possible action is to try moving in a different direction or wait, but waiting isn't an option. 

Wait, the available actions are north, east, south, west, and push in those directions. Since pushing west didn't work, maybe trying to push south or another direction. 

But the boulder is southsoutheast, so pushing it would require being adjacent to it. The agent isn't near the boulder, so they can't push it yet. 

The agent needs to navigate to the boulder's location. Given the current position and barriers, the only way might be to move east around the bars, but they are blocking that. 

This is perplexing. Maybe the agent should try moving south once, even if it's blocked, to see if there's a different layout. 

Alternatively, the agent could use a potion to heal, but that's not related to pushing the boulder. 

Given the current constraints, the best action might be to move west again, even though it's blocked, but the game might penalize that. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent should climb or kick, but those actions aren't listed. 

Wait, the available actions are only the four directions and push in those directions. So the agent can try pushing in a different direction. 

For example, pushing south if there's a boulder there. But the observation doesn't mention a boulder south of the agent. The boulder is southsoutheast. 

So the agent is at (38,9), and the boulder is at (further southeast). To reach it, the agent needs to move east and then south. But the bars are blocking east. 

This seems like a dead end. Maybe the agent needs to explore other areas of the map to find a way around. But given the current observations, the agent is stuck in this corridor. 

In conclusion, the agent should try to move east to get closer to the boulder, but since it's blocked by bars, the only safe action is to move west again, even though it results in a default action. Alternatively, try pushing east if there's a boulder there, but there isn't. 

Wait, the boulder is southsoutheast, not east. So pushing east wouldn't affect it. 

The agent needs to get to the boulder's position. Since they can't move east or south directly, maybe moving west to the stairs and then finding another path down. But that's not helpful. 

Given all this, the only possible action that doesn't result in an error is to move north, even though it's blocked, but the default action is north, which might not change anything. 

Alternatively, the agent could try pushing west again, but that's what caused the error. 

Hmm. Maybe the agent should try moving south once to see if there's a passage. 

But according to the observations, moving south is blocked by bars. 

In this case, the best action the agent can take is to move north, even though it's blocked, but the default action is north, so the agent might be stuck in a loop. 

Alternatively, the agent could try using an item, but there's no indication that's necessary. 

Given the constraints, the chosen action should be to move north, as it's the only direction that didn't cause an error in the previous steps, even though it's blocked. Or perhaps try moving west again, but that results in an error. 

Wait, the user's message says that previous outputs with ""push west"" were invalid and defaulted to north. So the agent should avoid push actions if they result in errors. 

Given that, the agent should try moving in a direction that's not blocked. Since all directions are blocked except possibly south or west, but both are blocked by bars, the agent has no valid moves. 

But the game requires an action, so the agent must choose one. In such cases, the best bet is to default to a direction that was previously allowed, even if it's blocked, but the game might penalize that. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent should try moving south, hoping that the bars are not in that exact spot. 

But according to the language observation, bars are near southsoutheast and south, so moving south from (38,9) to (38,10) might be blocked. 

Given all this, the only possible action without causing an error is to move north, as it was the default action before. However, the agent is stuck in a loop. 

But since the agent must output an action, the best choice is to try moving north again, even though it's blocked, as there are no other valid options.

Let's see where I am in this Boxoban level. I'm trying to push the boulder onto the fountain. From the observations, the boulder is located at the far southsoutheast. The player's current position is (38, 9). The bars are everywhere, especially to the east and south, making it hard to move directly towards the boulder.

In previous steps, I tried pushing west multiple times but kept getting blocked by bars. Then I moved east back to (38,9), but the bars are still blocking the way west. The message says I can't pass through bars, so I need to find another path.

Looking at the map, there's a stairs up near westsouthwest, which might be an exit, but the goal is to push the boulder onto the fountain. The fountain is near eastsoutheast and southeast. The boulder is very near southeast. So maybe I need to go around the bars to reach the boulder.

Wait, the player is at (38,9). If I move north, but there are bars adjacent north. The bars adjacent are north, northeast, east, and northwest. So moving north is blocked. How about moving south? The southern areas have dark areas and boulders. Maybe there's a way to get around the bars by moving south or west?

The stairs up are near westsouthwest. If I go southwest, maybe I can find a path. But the current position is (38,9). Moving west to (37,9) was possible earlier, but then I got blocked again. The bars are very near eastnortheast, east, southeast, and westnorthwest. So moving east is blocked by bars.

Perhaps I need to use a different strategy. Since pushing west isn't working, maybe I should try to move south around the bars. Let me check the map again. The map shows ########## in the south, which are likely bars or walls. The boulder is at southsoutheast, so maybe moving southeast could lead to it, but the bars are in the way.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a corridor I haven't explored yet. The dark areas might be passages. If I move south from (38,9), maybe there's a path through the dark area. But the language observation says dark area far east, southeast, and south. So moving south might be into darkness, which could be a dead end or a path.

Another idea: since the boulder is at southsoutheast, maybe I need to approach it from the north or west. But the bars are blocking the direct path. Maybe I need to use the stairs to go down to another level, but the current level is Dlvl:1, and the stairs up are near westsouthwest. But the goal is to push the boulder here, not go down.

Wait, the fountain is adjacent to southwest. So maybe if I can get the boulder to the southwest fountain, that would solve the level. The boulder is currently at southsoutheast. To move it to southwest, I need to push it west and north. But the bars are blocking west and north movements.

Perhaps I need to find a way to move around the bars. Let me think about the layout. The map has a lot of bars and dark areas. The player is in the center-east part of the map. The boulder is southeast. If I can push the boulder south, maybe around the dark area, but that's risky.

Alternatively, maybe the boulder can be pushed into the fountain by navigating around the bars. Since pushing west isn't working, maybe I should try pushing east towards the fountain. But the bars are very near east, so that's blocked.

Hmm, this is tricky. All direct paths are blocked by bars. Maybe I need to try a different direction. Let me check the adjacent areas again. The bars adjacent to the player are north, northeast, east, and northwest. So movement in those directions is blocked. The only possible free movement might be south or southwest, but the dark areas are there.

Wait, the stairs up are near westsouthwest. If I go southwest from (38,9) to (37,8), maybe that's a path. But I need to check if there are bars there. The language observation says bars very near eastnortheast, east, southeast, and westnorthwest. So westsouthwest might be clear.

Let me try moving southwest. So from (38,9) to (37,8). Is that allowed? The bars are very near westnorthwest, which is the opposite direction. So moving southwest might be possible. Let's attempt that.

Let's see. The agent is stuck in this Boxoban-like environment with bars blocking the way. The goal is to push the boulders onto the fountains. The latest observations show the agent is at (38,9) and keeps hitting bars when trying to move north. The map has a lot of bars and dark areas.

First, I need to understand the layout. The agent is facing north, and the bars are adjacent in the north direction. The boulder is far southsoutheast, near a fountain. The stairs up are westsouthwest, but the priority is to push the boulder to the fountain.

The agent tried moving west multiple times but was blocked by bars. Then tried pushing west, but maybe the boulder isn't there anymore. Wait, looking at the map, the boulder is marked with '@' near (38,9), which is the agent's current position. Wait, no, the map shows `##{@.##.`#` which might indicate the boulder is at (38,9)? Or maybe the agent is at that position with the boulder nearby.

Wait, the cursor says the agent is at (38,9). The map's line for y=9 has `##{@.##.`#`. So the `{` might be the agent, and `@` is the boulder? Or vice versa. In Boxoban, the boulders are usually '$' or '@', but the map here uses different symbols. The language observation mentions a boulder far southsoutheast. So maybe the `@` on the map is the boulder.

The agent is trying to move north but can't due to bars. The boulder is southsoutheast, so perhaps moving east or south could reach it. But the bars are blocking the way. The agent tried moving west and east but hit bars. Maybe needs to find a path around the bars to approach the boulder.

Alternatively, maybe the boulder is already in position. The language observation says the boulder is very near southeast. If the fountain is also there, pushing the boulder southeast might place it on the fountain. But the agent is currently at (38,9), and the boulder is southeast, so moving east or south might be needed.

Wait, the latest map shows at (38,9) the line is `##{@.##.`#`. So the agent is at x=38, y=9. The `@` is the boulder. So the agent is next to the boulder. To push it, the agent needs to move in the direction opposite to where they want to push. For example, to push the boulder west, the agent should move east into it.

But the agent tried pushing west earlier, but it didn't work. Maybe the boulder is already being pushed against a wall or bars. The bars are adjacent north, northeast, east, and northwest. So if the agent is trying to push west, the boulder might be blocked by bars to the west.

Looking at the cursor position and bars, the agent is at (38,9), and bars are adjacent to the north, northeast, east, and northwest. So moving east would be against the bars. Moving north is blocked. South might be possible if there's a path. But the boulder is to the southeast.

Perhaps the correct action is to move south to approach the boulder from the side, then push it east or southeast towards the fountain. Alternatively, since the agent is next to the boulder (`@`), maybe pushing west is possible if there's space behind the boulder. But the bars are to the northwest, so pushing west might not be feasible.

The agent needs to find a way to navigate around the bars to reach the boulder. Since moving north and east are blocked, moving south or west might be options. If moving south leads to a path where the boulder can be pushed east, that could work. Let's check the map again.

The map's y=9 line has `##{@.##.`#`. Below that (y=10) is `##########`, which are walls. So moving south from y=9 would hit the wall at y=10. So that's blocked. Moving west from x=38 would go to x=37, but earlier attempts showed that's blocked by bars. So the only possible directions are north (blocked), east (blocked by bars), south (blocked by wall), and west (blocked by bars). 

Wait, the bars adjacent are north, northeast, east, and northwest. So moving east would be against the bars. If the agent is at (38,9), moving east would take them to (39,9), which is blocked by bars. Same with north. South is a wall. West is also blocked. So the agent is surrounded by bars and a wall. The only way out is to push the boulder in a direction where there's space.

The boulder is at (38,9) (the `@`), so if the agent wants to push it west, they need to move east into it. But east is blocked by bars. If they push it south, they need to move north into it, but north is blocked. Pushing south would require the agent to move north first, which is impossible. Alternatively, pushing east into a direction where there's no bar.

Wait, maybe the boulder can be pushed east through a different path. Let me look at the map again. The map at y=9, x=38 is `{@.`, so the agent is at `{`, boulder at `@`, and the path continues with `##.`. So east of the boulder is `##.` which might be a path. If the agent can push the boulder east into that path, then maybe it can be moved towards the fountain.

So the agent needs to push the boulder east. To do that, the agent must move east into the boulder, which would require the space to the east of the boulder (x=40, y=9) to be unblocked. Looking at the map, at y=9, the line is `##{@.##.`#`. So after the boulder (`@`), there are `##.` which are paths. So east of the boulder is open. Therefore, the agent can push the boulder east by moving east into it.

But the agent's current position is (38,9), and the boulder is at (38,9) (assuming `{` is the agent and `@` is the boulder). So the agent needs to move east to (39,9) to push the boulder. But earlier observations said moving east was blocked by bars. Let me check the language observation again.

The language observation says bars are adjacent north, northeast, east, and northwest. So adjacent to the agent's current position (38,9), moving east would be into a bar. Therefore, the agent cannot move east directly. But the boulder is at (38,9), so to push it east, the agent must move east into the boulder, but that direction is blocked by a bar. Therefore, it's impossible to push the boulder east from here.

Alternative approach: maybe the agent needs to move south to a different position where the boulder can be pushed. But moving south is blocked by a wall. So that's not possible. 

Wait, maybe the agent can move west to get a different angle. The agent tried moving west before, but hit bars. The bars are to the northwest, so moving west from (38,9) to (37,9) is blocked. But perhaps there's a way to move west-northwest around the bars. However, the agent is at the edge of the map, as the lower part of the map is all #######, indicating walls.

Given that the agent is surrounded by bars and a wall, the only possible way to proceed is to push the boulder in a direction where there's space. Since pushing east is blocked by a bar, but the boulder can be pushed south if there's a path. Let me check the map again. South of the agent (y=10) is a wall. So pushing south isn't possible. 

Alternatively, maybe the boulder can be pushed southwest. The agent's current position is (38,9). To push southwest, the agent would need to move south-west into the boulder. But moving southwest from (38,9) would require checking the map's y=10, x=37. The map's y=10 line is `##########`, which is a wall. So that's blocked.

This is tricky. The agent is stuck in a corner with bars and a wall, adjacent to a boulder but unable to push it in any direction due to blocks. The only possible way out is to find a different path, but the agent's current position is surrounded. 

Wait, perhaps the agent needs to climb down stairs to a different level, but the stairs up are westsouthwest, which is probably not helpful. The goal is to push the boulder onto the fountain, which is located southeast. The boulder is currently near southeast, but perhaps not exactly on the fountain. 

Looking back at the language observation, the fountain is very near eastsoutheast and west. The boulder is very near southeast. So maybe the boulder is already on the fountain, but the agent hasn't placed it correctly. Or perhaps the agent needs to move the boulder further southeast.

But given the agent's current position and the surrounding blocks, it's impossible to push the boulder any further. The agent might need to find a different route to reach the boulder from another angle. However, based on the map and observations, the agent is stuck.

In such cases, the only possible action is to try to move in a direction that might have been previously possible but is now blocked due to dynamic changes. Alternatively, use an item from the inventory. The agent has a blessed potion of extra healing, scrolls, etc. But using a potion wouldn't help in moving the boulder.

Alternatively, the agent might need to backtrack to a previous position where movement was possible. But since the agent has been moving west multiple times and ended up here, backtracking east would be blocked by bars.

Given all this, the only valid action the agent can take without hitting bars is to try a different direction, even if it's still blocked, but perhaps there's a mistake in previous observations. However, based on the latest info, all directions are blocked. 

Wait, the map shows at y=9, x=38 as `{@.##.`#`. So after the boulder (`@`), there are `##.` which are paths. If the agent can move east into the boulder, pushing it to x=40, y=9, which is `##.` (path), then that would be valid. But the problem is that moving east from the agent's position (38,9) is blocked by a bar. However, the boulder is at (38,9), so maybe the agent is adjacent to the boulder and can push it east even if their own movement is blocked.

In Boxoban, you can push a boulder by moving into it, even if the space behind is occupied, as long as the boulder can be moved. So if the agent is at (38,9) next to the boulder at (38,9), and tries to move east (to 39,9), which is blocked by a bar, but the boulder can be pushed east to 40,9 if that space is empty.

Wait, but the agent's movement is blocked by the bar at 39,9, so they can't move east. However, if the boulder is at 38,9 and the agent is at 38,9, perhaps the agent is overlapping with the boulder. That might not make sense. Typically, the agent and boulder are separate tiles. So maybe the agent is at 37,9 and the boulder at 38,9. Then the agent can move east to 38,9 (the boulder's position) and push it further east.

But based on the cursor position, the agent is at (38,9), and the boulder is at (38,9) (as per the map's `@`). That would mean they're on the same tile, which isn't possible. There must be a misinterpretation of the map symbols. Maybe the `{` is the agent, `@` is the boulder, and the `.` are empty spaces. So the agent is at 38,9 (position of `{`), and the boulder is at 39,9 (position of `@`). Then the agent can move east to 39,9 (the boulder) and push it further east.

In that case, the correct action would be to push east. Even though the agent's movement east is blocked by the bar, the boulder can be pushed if the space behind is free. So the agent would push the boulder east into x=40, y=9, which is `##.` (path). That should work.

Therefore, the action should be `push east`.

I'm trying to figure out how to navigate this Boxoban level. The goal is to push the boulders onto the fountains. From the previous actions and observations, the agent has been moving around, trying to push a boulder west but keeps hitting bars. The latest observation shows the agent at (38, 9) and the boulder is very near southeast.

First, I need to check the map. The map shows a lot of bars and dark areas, which are probably walls or obstacles. The boulder is southsoutheast, so maybe it's in that direction. The agent tried pushing west before but the bars were blocking. Now, maybe the agent needs to move in a different direction to get around the bars and reach the boulder.

The agent's current position is (38,9). The boulder is very near southeast, so perhaps moving east or southeast could help. But looking at the language observations, there are bars near eastnortheast, east, and southeast. So moving directly east might hit those bars. Maybe the agent needs to first move south or north to find a path around the bars.

Alternatively, since the boulder is near southeast, the agent could try pushing it east towards a fountain. But the direction matters. If the boulder is southeast of the agent, pushing it east would require the agent to be to the northwest of the boulder. Wait, the agent's position is (38,9), and the boulder is very near southeast. So the boulder might be at (39,10) or similar. To push it east, the agent would need to be west of the boulder, which they might be.

But the problem is the bars. The latest observation says bars adjacent to north, northeast, east, and northwest. So the agent is surrounded by bars on those sides. The only possible movement might be south or west. However, moving west would go back to where they started, and there's a boulder there too. Maybe the agent needs to move south to find a way around the bars.

Looking at the map, there are a lot of `#` symbols which are walls, and `.` which are floor. The agent is at `##{.@##.`#`, so they're in a corridor with bars on the sides. The `@` is the agent. To the east, there's a `#` which is a bar. So pushing east isn't possible. The message says ""You cannot pass through the bars,"" so the agent is against a bar to the east.

The agent needs to find a path to the boulder. The boulder is near southeast, so maybe moving south first, then east? Let's check the map again. The map shows several `#` in the lower part. If the agent moves south, they might hit more bars, but perhaps there's a path. Alternatively, moving west might lead to a corridor where they can then move south or east.

Wait, the cursor's position is (38,9). The map's detail at that line is `##{.@##.`#, so the agent is between the bars. To the west, there's another `#`, so moving west isn't possible. South, the next line is `#<.{..{..#`, which has a `<` which might be a door or a passage. Maybe moving south to that door could open a path.

Alternatively, looking at the adjacent bars, the agent is north of some bars. Maybe moving south and then east around the bars. Let's think step by step:

1. Current position: (38,9), surrounded by bars on north, northeast, east, northwest.
2. The boulder is very near southeast, so maybe at (39,10) or (38,10).
3. To push the boulder east, need to be west of it. If the agent moves south to (38,10), then east might be possible if there's a path.
4. Check the map at y=10: `#<.{..{..#`. At x=38, y=10, the character is `<`, which could be a door. If the agent moves south to (38,10), then they can go through the `<` door to the southeast, which might lead to the boulder's location.

So possible actions:

- Move south to (38,10) to access the door.
- Then move east through the door to the next area where the boulder is.
- Once there, push the boulder east towards a fountain.

Alternatively, since the agent is stuck between bars, moving south might be the only viable option to find a path.

Another thing to consider is the stairs up near westsouthwest. Maybe the agent needs to reach the stairs, but the goal is to push boulders onto fountains, so that's secondary.

In the latest observation, the agent tried pushing west, east, north, etc., but kept hitting bars. So maybe the correct path is to move south, then east through the door, locate the boulder, and push it towards a fountain.

So the next action should be moving south to get to the door and find a path forward.

Let's see where I am. In this Boxoban-like game, I need to push boulders onto fountains. The cursor is at (38, 10). The map shows some bars and fountains nearby. Looking at the language observation, there's a fountain very near east and westnorthwest. There's a boulder adjacent southeast. So maybe the boulder is to the southeast of my current position?

My current position is (38,10). If the boulder is adjacent southeast, that would be (39,11). The goal is to push it onto a fountain. The fountain is very near east and westnorthwest. So the east fountain might be in that direction. But first, I need to navigate around the bars. 

Wait, the bars are blocking north, northeast, and northwest according to the previous observations. So moving north, northeast, or northwest would hit bars. The last action was south, which moved me to y=10. Now the map shows a '@' at (38,10), which is my position. The boulder is at (39,11), adjacent southeast. To push it east, I would need to move east first, then push. But bars are blocking east directions? Let me check the language observation again.

The bars very near north, northnortheast, northeast, eastnortheast, eastsoutheast, southeast, southsoutheast, south, northwest, and northnorthwest. So moving east would take me into eastsoutheast bars. That's blocked. So I can't go east directly. Maybe I need to go around. 

Alternatively, the stairs are up near westsouthwest. But the goal is to push boulders onto fountains. The fountain is very near east and westnorthwest. The boulder is at southeast, so maybe pushing it southwest towards the westnorthwest fountain? Wait, the boulder is adjacent southeast, so if I move southwest, I can get behind it and push it west towards the fountain. 

But let me check the map again. The map shows a '<' symbol at (37,9), which might be another object. The '@' is at (38,9) in the previous steps, but now after moving south, it's at (38,10). The boulder is at (39,11) according to the cursor position. To push the boulder southwest, I need to move to (38,10) which is my current position, then push west into (37,10), but there might be bars. 

Looking at the bars adjacent northeast. So moving west from (38,10) would be to (37,10). Are there bars there? The language observation says bars very near north, etc., but doesn't specify west. Maybe it's clear. Let me see the map. The map row for y=10 has `##{..##.`#`, so position (38,10) is the '.' before the '#'. So moving west from (38,10) to (37,10) is a '.' which is probably a floor. Then, if there's a boulder at (39,11), I can move to (38,10), then push west to (37,10), but wait, the boulder is at (39,11). So maybe I need to move south to (38,11) first? 

Alternatively, since the boulder is adjacent southeast, which is (39,11), and I'm at (38,10), the direction to the boulder is southeast. To push it, I need to move into it from the west. So I need to move to (39,10) and then push east. But (39,10) might be blocked by bars. The language observation mentions bars near eastsoutheast, so moving east from (38,10) to (39,10) is eastsoutheast bars, which are blocking. So that's not possible. 

Therefore, perhaps the correct move is to go around to the west of the boulder. Since the boulder is at (39,11), moving west from there would be (38,11). But how to get there? From (38,10), move south to (38,11), then west to (37,11), then check if I can push the boulder west into the fountain. 

But before that, I need to check if there are obstacles. The bars are mostly in the north, northeast, etc. So moving south to (38,11) is possible if that's not blocked. The map shows y=11 as `##...`#..#`, so position (38,11) is a '.' which is floor. Then move west to (37,11), which is also a '.'. Then from there, move south to (37,12), but not sure. Alternatively, once I'm at (37,11), I can look at the boulder at (39,11) and try to push it west. 

But maybe a better approach is to check the fountain locations. The fountain is very near east and westnorthwest. The westnorthwest fountain would be in that direction. So if I can push the boulder westnorthwest, that would get it onto the fountain. 

Alternatively, the boulder at (39,11) can be pushed southwest towards the westnorthwest fountain. To do that, I need to position myself west of the boulder. So from my current position (38,10), move south to (38,11), then west to (37,11), then move south to (37,12), etc., until I'm adjacent to the boulder's west side. 

Another thing to note is that the stairs are up near westsouthwest, but the priority is to push boulders. So focusing on the boulder at southeast. 

So step-by-step:

1. From (38,10), move south to (38,11) – possible as per map.
2. Move west to (37,11) – floor.
3. Move south to (37,12) – check map.
4. Continue moving west until I'm adjacent to the boulder's west side.
5. Push the boulder west into the fountain.

But need to ensure there's no obstacle behind the boulder. The boulder is at (39,11). To push it west, the cell behind it (38,11) should be floor. Since I'm moving to (37,11) and then maybe (37,12), the path behind the boulder would be (38,11) which is floor, so pushing west is possible.

Alternatively, maybe a direct path exists. Let me check the map again. At y=11, the row is `##...`#..#`. So positions 37-40 in y=11 are: ##...`#..#. So (37,11) is '.', (38,11) is '.', (39,11) is '`' which might be a wall or different terrain. Wait, maybe the boulder is at (39,11), but the '`' is part of the map's decoration. Need to confirm. 

The boulder is mentioned in the language observation as adjacent southeast. So if I'm at (38,10), southeast is (39,11). The map shows at (39,11) a '`' symbol, which could be a boulder. So yes, that's the boulder. To push it west, I need to move into it from the west. So from (38,10), move to (39,10) (which is eastsoutheast bars, blocked) or move south to (38,11), then west to (37,11), then south to (37,12), etc., until I can get west of the boulder. 

Alternatively, maybe moving west from (38,10) to (37,10) is possible. The map at y=10 is `##{..##.`#`, so (37,10) is '.' which is floor. Then from there, move south to (37,11), which is also '.', then move west to (36,11), etc., until I can get behind the boulder. 

Alternatively, once I'm at (37,10), I can look for a path to the boulder's west. The boulder is at (39,11). So moving from (37,10) to (37,11), then (37,12), (37,13), etc., until reaching (37,11), then moving north or south to align with the boulder. 

But perhaps the most straightforward is:

- Move west from (38,10) to (37,10) (possible as it's a '.').
- Then move south to (37,11) (floor).
- Then move west to (36,11) (if possible).
- Continue moving west until I can get to the boulder's west side.

Once positioned west of the boulder, push west to move it towards the fountain. 

Alternatively, since the fountain is westnorthwest, pushing the boulder west would head towards that direction. 

Another consideration: the stairs are up near westsouthwest, but pushing the boulder is the priority. 

So, possible actions:

1. west -> move to (37,10)
2. south -> to (38,11)
3. west again to (37,11)
4. Continue moving west or south to get behind the boulder.

But I need to ensure that the path is clear. 

Given the current cursor position is (38,10), and the boulder is at (39,11), the best move might be to first move west to (37,10), then south to (37,11), then west to (36,11), etc., creating a path to the boulder's west. 

Alternatively, move south to (38,11), then west to (37,11), then south to (37,12), etc. 

Once close enough, push west. 

But considering the bars, need to avoid moving into them. 

The bars are near eastnortheast, eastsoutheast, etc., so moving west and south should be clear. 

So the next action could be west to get to (37,10).

Let's see where I am. I'm in Boxoban, trying to push boulders onto fountains. The map has a bunch of bars (which are probably walls or obstacles), dark areas, and some items like an apple and potions. The main goal is to move the boulders to the fountains.

Looking at the current observation, I'm at position (37, 10). The cursor shows I'm the tourist, so that's me. The inventory has some items, but I don't see any boulders mentioned. Wait, maybe the boulders are represented differently on the map. Let me check the map again.

The map shows symbols like @{, `. , {, }, etc. The boulders are usually marked with 'o' in Sokoban-like games, but here it's possible they use a different symbol. Let me scan the map again. Hmm, in the line with ##{..##.`#, there's a `<.@..{..#`. The `<` might be a door or another object. The `@` is probably me. The `{` and `}` could be walls or other structures. I don't see any obvious boulders (like 'o's) on the map. Maybe they're hidden or represented differently.

The language observation mentions boulders near eastnortheast, southeast, and southsoutheast. So there are boulders in those directions. The fountains are near east and eastsoutheast. So the goal is to push the boulders from the southeast and southsoutheast to the east and eastsoutheast fountains.

My current position is (37,10). To reach the boulders mentioned, perhaps I need to move southeast or east. But the bars (walls) are blocking some paths. The message says I can't pass through bars, so I need to find a path around them.

Looking at the map, the bars are adjacent to north, northeast, and northwest. So moving north, northeast, or northwest is blocked. But south, west, east might be possible. Wait, in the map, the current position's row has `##{..##.`#. The `@` is at position 37,10. To the west (left on the map) is a `{`, which is a bar, so I can't go west. To the east (right) is a `.` which might be a floor. South would be the next row, which has `##...`#..#`, so maybe a floor there.

In the previous steps, I tried moving east multiple times but got errors because of bars. Wait, the last valid action was moving south to get to (38,10), then tried going west but hit a bar. Now, after moving south to (38,10), I moved west to (37,10), but the bar is still there. Hmm, maybe the boulders are in the southeast direction. The fountains are near east, so perhaps pushing a boulder from the southsoutheast to the east fountain.

Wait, the language observation says there's a boulder very near southeast. So maybe south of my current position. If I can move south again, perhaps I can reach it. But the map's next row after (37,10) is `##{..##.`#, which is the same row. Wait, maybe the map is a grid where each line represents a row. Let me check the map structure again.

The map has 9 rows (since the last line is ##########). The agent is at (37,9) initially, then moved to (38,9), then (38,10), then (37,10). The rows are probably numbered from top to bottom. So moving north decreases the y-coordinate, and south increases it. But the exact map layout is a bit unclear. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent is on a grid where each cell is represented by characters. The `@` is the agent, and the `o` would be the boulders. Since I don't see any `o`s, perhaps they are represented differently. The language observation mentions boulders near eastnortheast, southeast, etc., so I need to navigate towards those areas.

Given that the fountains are near east and eastsoutheast, and there's a boulder very near southeast, maybe the best move is to head southeast towards that boulder and push it towards the fountain. But the agent's current position is (37,10). Moving southeast would require moving east and south. However, the bars are blocking some paths. 

Looking at the latest map, at (37,10), the squares to the east (38,10) is a `.` which is passable. To the south (37,11) would be the next row, which is `##...`#..#`, so the first few cells are walls (`#`), then `...` which are floors. So moving south from (37,10) to (37,11) would hit a wall. Therefore, can't go south directly.

Alternatively, move east to (38,10), then see if I can go south from there. But the language observation says there's a boulder very near southeast. If I move east to (38,10), then south to (38,11), which might be a floor. Then check if there's a boulder there. 

Alternatively, since the agent is at (37,10), and the boulder is southeast, maybe moving east first, then south. But need to avoid walls. Let's try to map the possible path:

Current position: (37,10). East is (38,10), which is a `.` (floor). Moving east to (38,10). From there, south to (38,11) which is a `.` in the next row (##...`#..#` at position 38 would be the fifth character, which is a `.`). So that's passable. Then, continue moving east or south to reach the boulder.

But the language observation mentions a boulder very near southeast. If I move east from (38,10) to (39,10), then south to (39,11), maybe that's where the boulder is. However, need to check for obstacles. The bars are very near north, northnortheast, etc., but the immediate area to the east and southeast might be clear.

Another approach: The fountains are adjacent to southwest. So maybe a boulder is blocking the path to the fountain. But the agent needs to push it. Alternatively, the agent should find a boulder and push it towards a fountain.

Since the last action was west to (37,10), and the bars are to the west (left on the map), maybe the best move is to go east again to (38,10), then proceed to the southeast direction where the boulder is. 

Looking at the inventory, there's a blessed potion of extra healing and some food. But that's probably not relevant for moving boulders. The main task is to push the boulders. 

So the plan is: move east to (38,10), then south to (38,11), then continue east or southeast to find the boulder and push it towards the fountain. But first, need to ensure the path is clear. 

Alternatively, since the boulder is very near southeast of (37,10), moving east once to (38,10), then south to (38,11), then east to (39,11), and check if there's a boulder there. If yes, push it east towards the fountain. 

But the agent needs to confirm the position of the boulder. Given that the language observation says ""boulder very near southeast"", which from (37,10) would be moving east and south. 

Another thing to consider: the stairs up are very near westsouthwest, so maybe not directly relevant unless it's a way out, but the goal is to push boulders, not escape.

So, the next logical step is to move east to (38,10), then south to (38,11), then check for the boulder. If the path is clear, proceed. If there's a bar, find another route. 

Alternatively, since the agent is at (37,10), moving south is blocked by a wall (the row below starts with ##...`#..#`, so the first two cells are walls). So can't go south directly. Must go east or west. But west is a bar, so east is the only option. 

So, move east to (38,10). From there, possibly move south to (38,11), then east or southeast. 

But the agent's previous attempts to push west resulted in errors, probably because there's a bar or a boulder in the way. 

Alternatively, check if the boulder is adjacent. The language observation says ""boulder very near southeast"", which from (37,10) would be (38,11) or (39,11). If the agent moves east to (38,10), then south to (38,11), and then east to (39,11), there might be a boulder there that can be pushed. 

Assuming that the boulder is at (39,11), the agent can move there and push east towards the fountain. 

But need to make sure the path is clear. Since the bars are near eastnortheast, etc., but the immediate area to the east and south might be clear. 

So the chosen action is to move east again to (38,10), then proceed south and east towards the boulder. 

Given the previous actions and the observations, the next step is to move east to get closer to the boulder.

Let's see what's happening here. The agent is in Boxoban, pushing boulders onto fountains. The current position is (38, 10). The map shows some bars and dark areas, but the key elements are the boulders and fountains.

Looking at the language observation, there's a boulder adjacent to the southeast and a fountain adjacent to the west. The agent's current position is next to a boulder. The goal is to push the boulder onto the fountain. Since the boulder is southeast of the agent, pushing it west would move it towards the fountain west of the agent's current position.

The agent just moved east to (38,10), and the boulder is at (38,10) southeast. So pushing west from there would move the boulder to (38,9), which is adjacent to the fountain. That seems like the right move to solve the level. The previous attempts were hitting bars, so now targeting the boulder to push it into the fountain.

88,push west,"<reasoning>
Let's see. The agent is in Boxoban, trying to push boulders onto fountains. The current position is (38,9). The map has several bars blocking movement, and there's a boulder very near the southeast. The goal is to get that boulder onto a fountain.

Looking at the previous actions, the agent tried pushing west multiple times but got errors. Maybe the boulder is in a different direction. The message says ""You cannot pass through the bars,"" so maybe there's a bar preventing movement. The agent is at (38,9), and the boulder is very near southeast. To push the boulder, the agent needs to move towards it, probably east or south.

Wait, the last few actions were north, north, east, push west, etc., but kept defaulting to north. The latest valid move was south to (38,10), then west to (37,10), then east back. The agent is now back at (38,9). The boulder is very near southeast, so maybe it's at (39,9) or (38,10). 

The agent needs to approach the boulder. Since bars are blocking north, northeast, and northwest, maybe moving east towards the boulder is possible. But when the agent tried push west before, it didn't work. Maybe the boulder is to the east, and the agent needs to push it west into a fountain. The fountains are adjacent south and west, according to the latest observation.

So, if the boulder is near southeast (southsoutheast), pushing it west towards the fountain adjacent west would be the goal. The agent should move east to get next to the boulder, then push west. But the agent is at (38,9). If the boulder is at (39,9), then moving east to (39,9) and pushing west into (38,9) might work, but the fountain is adjacent west at (37,9), which is the current position's west. Wait, the agent is at (38,9), so west would be (37,9). The fountain is adjacent southwest, which is (37,8) or similar. Maybe the correct direction is to push the boulder south into a fountain. Alternatively, check the map.

Looking at the map, it's all ########## with some characters. The agent's position is marked with {@. The boulder is very near southeast, so maybe at (39,10) or (38,11). The fountains are adjacent south and west. The agent is at (38,9). The fountain adjacent south would be at (38,8), and west at (37,9). If the boulder is at (38,10), pushing it south into (38,9) might not reach a fountain. Alternatively, pushing it west into (37,9) where there's a fountain. 

But the agent is at (38,9). To push a boulder west, the agent needs to be adjacent to it. So if the boulder is at (37,9), pushing east into it. But the latest observation says the boulder is very near southeast. Maybe the boulder is at (38,10) or (39,9). Let me recheck the language observation.

The latest language observation says: ""boulder very near southeast"". The agent is at (38,9). Southeast would be (39,10) or (38,10). If the boulder is at (38,10), then the agent is at (38,9) south of it. To push it south into a fountain, which is adjacent south at (38,8). But the agent can't move south into a bar. Alternatively, pushing the boulder east into a fountain. Wait, the fountains are adjacent southwest and west. The agent is at (38,9), so west is (37,9), which is a fountain. So if the boulder is at (38,9) west (37,9), but that's a fountain. Maybe the boulder is at (38,10), and pushing it south into (38,9) which is a bar? No, bars are adjacent north, northeast, etc. 

Alternatively, maybe the boulder is at (39,9), and the agent needs to push it west into (38,9), but (38,9) is where the agent is. That doesn't make sense. Maybe the correct action is to move east to (39,9) and then push west into a fountain. But the agent can't pass through bars. The bars are very near eastnortheast, east, southeast, and westnorthwest. So moving east might hit a bar. 

Alternatively, the agent should try to move south to (38,10) and then see if the boulder is there. The last move was south to (38,10), but then west to (37,10), then east back. Maybe the boulder is at (38,10), and pushing it south into (38,9) which is a bar? No. Alternatively, the boulder is at (37,10), and the agent can push it east into (38,10) towards a fountain. 

This is a bit confusing. The key is to get the boulder onto a fountain. The fountains are adjacent south and west. The agent is at (38,9). The west fountain is at (37,9), which is a fountain. If the boulder can be pushed west into (37,9), that would solve it. So the agent needs to be adjacent to the boulder and push it west. 

Assuming the boulder is at (39,9), the agent would move east to (39,9) and then push west. But there's a bar very near eastnortheast, east, southeast, and westnorthwest. Moving east from (38,9) would go to (39,9), which might be blocked by a bar. The latest language observation says bars very near eastnortheast, east, southeast, and westnorthwest. So east of (38,9) is eastnortheast, which is blocked. Therefore, the agent can't move east directly. 

Alternative approach: move south to (38,10), then west to (37,10), then south to (37,11), and look for the boulder. But without seeing the map clearly, it's tricky. 

Another idea: since the agent is at (38,9) and the boulder is very near southeast, perhaps the boulder is at (38,10) or (39,9). If the agent moves south to (38,10), then checks the boulder's position. If it's there, try to push it west or south. 

But given the previous invalid actions, maybe the correct move is to try pushing west again, even though it failed before. Or perhaps move south to get closer. 

Alternatively, check the adjacent squares. The agent is at (38,9). South is (38,10), which has a boulder very near southeast. Wait, the boulder is very near southeast of (38,9), which would be (39,10). So the boulder is at (39,10). To push it west, the agent needs to be at (39,9) or (38,10). 

If the agent moves east to (39,9), then they can push the boulder at (39,10) west into (38,10). But is (39,9) blocked by bars? The bars are very near eastnortheast, east, etc. So moving east from (38,9) to (39,9) might be possible if there's no bar there. The latest observation says bars very near eastnortheast, east, southeast, and westnorthwest. So east of (38,9) is east direction, which is a bar. Therefore, the agent can't move east. 

So maybe the agent needs to move south to (38,10), then see if the boulder is there. From (38,10), pushing west might be possible. The agent was at (38,10) after moving south, then went west to (37,10). If the boulder is at (38,10), pushing it west to (37,10) which is a fountain. That could work. 

So the steps would be: move south to (38,10), then west to (37,10), then push west into the fountain. But the agent already tried moving west from (38,10) and might have encountered a bar. 

Alternatively, from (38,10), check the adjacent squares. If the boulder is at (38,11), pushing it south into (38,10) which is a bar. Not helpful. 

Given the confusion, the safest action might be to try pushing west again from (38,9), even though it failed before, in case the environment changed. Or move south to (38,10) and then attempt to push west from there. 

Given the previous default to north due to invalid actions, perhaps the agent should try a different direction. Maybe move south to (38,10) and then check. 

But the correct action based on the current position and the need to push the boulder onto a fountain is to move towards the boulder and push it west into the adjacent west fountain at (37,9). 

So, the agent should move east to (39,9) if possible, but since that's blocked, perhaps move south to (38,10) and then west to (37,10), then push west into (37,9) which is a fountain. 

But the agent is at (38,9). So the sequence would be: south to (38,10), west to (37,10), then push west. 

However, the latest observation after moving south to (38,10) showed the agent at (38,10) with the boulder near southeast. So the boulder might be at (39,10). From (38,10), moving east to (39,10) and pushing west into (38,10) might not reach a fountain. 

Alternatively, from (38,10), push south into (38,9), but that's a bar. 

This is tricky. Maybe the best action is to push west from (38,9) again, hoping that the boulder is adjacent there. If not, the agent might need to reposition. 

Given the agent's current position and the need to avoid bars, the chosen action is to push west.

I'm trying to solve this Boxoban level. The goal is to push all the boulders onto the fountains. Let me look at the current situation.

From the observations, the agent is at position (38,9). The map shows some bars and fountains around. There's a boulder at southsoutheast, and a fountain nearby. The bars are blocking movement in some directions, so I need to find a way around them.

The previous actions tried moving north, east, and south, but hit bars. The last few attempts to push east or west resulted in errors because the actions weren't properly formatted. I need to focus on valid movements that can lead to pushing the boulder.

Looking at the map, maybe moving west could allow accessing the area near the fountain. The boulder is southsoutheast, so perhaps moving towards it while avoiding the bars. Let me check the map again. The cursor is at (38,9), and the boulder is southsoutheast. Moving south might get closer, but there are bars to the south. Alternatively, moving west to reach the stairs up in westsouthwest, but that might not help directly.

Wait, the stairs up are near westsouthwest. Going there could change levels, but the goal is on this level. Maybe pushing the boulder towards the fountain southsoutheast. To do that, need to find an unblocked path. The agent is currently at (38,9). If I move west to (37,9), then perhaps can push the boulder east into the fountain. But the boulder is southsoutheast, so maybe moving in that direction.

Alternatively, check if the boulder is adjacent. The message says ""boulder far southsoutheast"". So it's not immediately next to the agent. Need to navigate closer. Moving south to (38,10) was possible, but there's a bar adjacent north, northeast, east, and northwest. So moving south might be blocked by bars. Wait, in the last observation, moving south got to (38,10), but the bars are very near north, etc. So perhaps moving southwest or westsouthwest?

Wait, the cursor is at (38,9). The bars adjacent are north, northeast, east, and northwest. So directly north, northeast, east, or northwest are blocked by bars. So movement options are south, southwest, west, or southeast. Let me check the map again. The map shows at (38,9), there's a `@` which is the agent. To the south is a `.` maybe, but looking at the map provided, it's a bit hard to parse. The map shows lines with symbols like ########. Maybe the agent is in a corridor with bars on the sides.

Given the barriers, the best bet is to move west towards the stairs up in westsouthwest. From (38,9), moving west to (37,9) is possible if there's no bar. The language observation says ""bars adjacent north, northeast, east, and northwest"", so west should be clear. Once at (37,9), check if the boulder is nearby. The boulder is far southsoutheast, so moving south from there. But need to avoid bars.

Alternatively, move south to (38,10) where there's a fountain adjacent west. Maybe pushing the boulder towards that fountain. But how to reach the boulder. The boulder is at southsoutheast, so from (38,9), moving southeast or south. But movement is blocked by bars. Hmm.

Another approach: since pushing is required, maybe find a direction where the boulder can be pushed into a fountain. The fountain is near eastsoutheast and southeast. If the boulder is at southsoutheast, perhaps pushing it north into the fountain. But need to get the agent close enough.

Wait, the agent is at (38,9). The boulder is far southsoutheast. So moving south to (38,10), then west to (37,10), then south again. But bars are in the way. Alternatively, move west to (37,9), then south to (37,10), then west to (36,10), etc., navigating around the bars to reach the boulder's location.

But the problem is the agent might be stuck in a loop trying to move around bars. The key is to find a path that allows pushing the boulder. Since the previous attempts to push didn't work because of invalid actions, maybe first navigate to the boulder's location and then push it.

Given the current position (38,9), and the boulder at southsoutheast, maybe move southwest. But the language observation mentions dark areas and bars in various directions. It's a bit unclear. Alternatively, move west to (37,9) to reduce x-coordinate, then see if can move south.

In the last valid observation after moving west to (37,10), the agent was at (37,10) with a fountain adjacent west. Maybe moving west from there to reach the fountain. But the boulder is still southsoutheast. Perhaps the agent needs to circle around to the area where the boulder is.

Alternatively, check if there's a staircase down or up. The stairs up are near westsouthwest. Maybe going there could provide a different path, but the goal is on the current level.

Given the time constraints and previous errors, the safest valid movement that doesn't hit bars is to move west or south. Since moving north is blocked by bars, and east is also blocked, west and south might be options. From (38,9), moving west to (37,9) is possible if there's no bar there. The language observation says bars are adjacent north, northeast, east, northwest. So west should be clear. So action: west.

Let's try to figure out how to solve this Boxoban problem. The goal is to push the boulders onto the fountains. Let's start by looking at the current observation.

The player is at position (37, 9). There's a boulder at ""boulder far southsoutheast"" and another nearby. The fountains are located at eastsoutheast and southeast. The bars are blocking many paths, especially to the east and south. The cursor shows the agent's position, and the map has a lot of walls (#) and dark areas.

First, I need to locate the boulders and fountains precisely. The boulder very near southeast and the one near east and southsoutheast. The fountains are adjacent to south and west, which might be near the agent's current position.

The agent was trying to move east and push west, but the bars are blocking those paths. The last valid action was moving south to (38, 10), then west back to (37, 10). Now the cursor is back at (37, 9). 

Looking at the map, the agent is near some walls. To the west might be a wall or bars. The fountain is adjacent to the southwest, so maybe to the west or southwest direction. The boulder is very near southeast, so perhaps pushing it towards the fountain there.

The problem is the bars are blocking direct paths. The agent needs to navigate around the bars to reach the boulders. Let's check possible moves. Moving north might be blocked by bars adjacent north, northeast, and northwest. South is possible, but there's a boulder there. West might be blocked by bars very near east, southwest, west, and westnorthwest.

The only open direction seems to be east, but there's a boulder near east and southsoutheast. Maybe the agent can push the boulder eastward towards the fountain. But to do that, the agent needs to move east first, then push the boulder.

Wait, the agent is at (37,9). If they move east to (38,9), then if there's a boulder there, they can push it. But the observation mentions a boulder very near southeast, which might be at (38,10) or nearby. Alternatively, the boulder near east and southsoutheast could be at (38,9) or (39,10).

Alternatively, the agent could try to move south to (37,10) and then east to (38,10), where there's a boulder. Then push it north or south towards the fountain. The fountain is adjacent to south and west, so maybe the fountain is to the south or west of the boulder.

But given the bars are blocking many paths, the agent needs to find a way around. Let's think step by step:

1. Current position: (37,9)
2. Check adjacent cells:
   - North: bars adjacent, cannot move.
   - East: Might be a boulder or bars.
   - South: Dark area, possibly open.
   - West: Bars very near, cannot move.

So the only possible movement is south or east. Let's try moving south to (37,10). From there, maybe east to (38,10) where there's a boulder. Then push the boulder west or north towards the fountain.

But the fountain is adjacent to south and west. If the boulder is pushed west to (37,10), that's adjacent to the fountain west. So maybe that's the way.

Alternatively, the agent could move south to (37,10), then east to (38,10) where the boulder is, and push it west to (37,10), placing it on the fountain west.

Another possibility is that the boulder near southsoutheast is at (39,11) or similar, and needs to be pushed to the fountain at southeast.

But without the exact map layout, it's challenging. The map shows ########## around, so the agent is in a corridor with walls. The key is to find the boulders and move them to fountains avoiding bars.

Considering the previous actions where the agent tried to push west but failed due to bars, maybe the correct approach is to move east to the boulder and push it towards a fountain.

So the next action could be east to (38,9), then push west if possible, but if there's a boulder there, push it east towards the fountain. Alternatively, move south to (37,10), then east to (38,10), push the boulder south or west.

But the agent's current position after the last valid action is (37,9). Let's check the latest map:

The map shows at (37,9) the character is {@.##.`# — so maybe the agent is at position (37,9) with some walls to the north and east.

Given the bars are blocking north, northeast, and northwest, the agent can't go north. South is possible, west is blocked by bars. So east might be the only option, but there's a boulder near east.

Looking at the language observation: boulder near east and southsoutheast. So perhaps the boulder is at (38,9) or (38,10). If the agent moves east to (38,9), and there's a boulder there, they can push it west or south.

If the boulder is at (38,9), pushing west to (37,9) would place it adjacent to the agent's current position, but the fountain is adjacent to west. So pushing the boulder west to (37,9) wouldn't be on a fountain. Alternatively, push it south to (38,10), which might be towards a fountain.

The fountain is adjacent to south and west. So if the boulder is pushed south to (38,10), and there's a fountain there, that would solve it.

So the steps could be:

1. Move east to (38,9) if possible.
2. If there's a boulder there, push it south to (38,10), which is adjacent to a fountain west.

But need to check if the path is clear. The bars near eastnortheast, etc., but maybe the path to the south is clear.

Alternatively, the agent could move south to (37,10), then east to (38,10), push the boulder west to (37,10) where the fountain is adjacent west.

Given the uncertainty in the map layout, the safest valid action that progresses towards the goal is to move east towards the boulder and attempt to push it towards a fountain. So the next action would be east.

Let's try to figure out what to do here. The agent is in a Boxoban-like environment, trying to push boulders onto fountains. The previous actions have been mostly moving east, west, north, and south, but there are bars blocking some paths.

First, looking at the map, the agent's current position is (38,9). The map shows some bars in various directions, which the agent can't pass through. The inventory has items, but since it's a movement-focused game, maybe the key is to navigate around the obstacles and find the boulders.

In the latest observation, after moving east from (37,9) to (38,9), there's a boulder near the east and southsoutheast. The fountains are near eastsoutheast and west. The bars are adjacent to the north, northeast, east, and northwest. The agent is adjacent to a fountain to the southwest, which is a good target for pushing a boulder.

The agent tried pushing west before but got blocked by bars. Now, perhaps the boulder at (37,9) can be pushed east towards the fountain at (38,10) or somewhere else. Wait, the cursor is at (38,9), so if there's a boulder to the west (37,9), maybe pushing it east would move it towards the fountain. But need to check if the path is clear.

From the current position (38,9), looking west to (37,9), there's a boulder. If the agent pushes west, the boulder would move to (36,9), but are there bars or obstacles there? The bars near eastnortheast, eastsoutheast, etc., but maybe the path to the west is clear. Alternatively, pushing east towards the fountain adjacent to southwest, but that might not be the right direction.

Wait, the fountain adjacent southwest is at (37,8) perhaps? The agent is at (38,9). So pushing the boulder west into the fountain at (37,9) where there's a fountain? Let me check the language observations again. The fountain is adjacent southwest, so maybe (38,8) or (37,9). If the boulder is at (37,9) and the agent is at (38,9), pushing the boulder west would move it to (37,9) but that's where the agent is. Wait, no—pushing a boulder requires being next to it and moving in the direction. If the agent is at (38,9) and the boulder is at (37,9), then pushing west would move the boulder to (36,9). But we need to check if there's a fountain there.

Alternatively, maybe the boulder is further south. The latest observation mentions a boulder very near southsoutheast. So perhaps at (39,10) or similar. The agent is at (38,9). To push that boulder north or northwest towards a fountain. The fountains are near eastsoutheast and west. 

But the agent is adjacent to a fountain at the southwest. If there's a boulder nearby that can be pushed into that fountain, that would be the goal. From the current position, looking southwest would be (38,8). The fountain is adjacent southwest, so maybe (38,8) has a fountain. If there's a boulder at (38,9) south of the agent, but the agent is at (38,9), so the boulder might be at (38,10). But the agent moved south earlier to (38,10), and there was a boulder near southsoutheast.

This is a bit confusing. Let me try to parse the latest map. The map shows at position (x=38, y=9) the character '@' which is the agent. The surrounding tiles: to the west (37,9) is '{', which might be a boulder ('{')? Or maybe a different object. The map symbols might need checking. In MiniHack/Boxoban, 'b' is a boulder, '#' is a wall, '.' is floor, '<' or '>' are stairs, etc. But the current map shows symbols like '{@.##.`#' which might be part of the map's ASCII art. It's a bit unclear.

Alternatively, the language observations mention a boulder near east and southsoutheast. The agent is at (38,9). So the boulder to the east might be at (39,9), and southsoutheast at (39,10) or (40,10). The fountains are near eastsoutheast and southwest. The southwest fountain might be at (37,8) or similar. 

To push a boulder onto a fountain, the agent needs to be adjacent to the boulder and then push it towards the fountain. Given the previous attempts to push west resulted in errors due to bars, maybe the correct approach is to move towards the boulder that can be pushed into a fountain. 

Looking at the latest cursor position (38,9) and the adjacent fountains, maybe pushing a boulder from the southsoutheast into the fountain to the eastsoutheast. But the agent is at (38,9), so moving south to (38,10) where there's a boulder near southsoutheast. From there, pushing east or northeast towards the fountain. 

Alternatively, since the agent is adjacent to a fountain to the southwest, perhaps there's a boulder nearby that can be pushed there. If the boulder is to the west (37,9), pushing it west into the fountain at (37,8) might work. But need to confirm if that path is clear. 

Given the bars are adjacent to the north, northeast, east, and northwest, moving west might be blocked by bars, but if the boulder is just one tile away, maybe pushing it is possible. 

In the latest observation, after moving west to (37,9), there's a boulder near east and southsoutheast. So at (37,9), the boulder is east of the agent. Wait, the agent is at (38,9), so the boulder could be at (39,9) (east) or (38,10) (south). The message says boulder near east and southsoutheast. So maybe (39,9) is east, and (39,10) or (40,10) is southsoutheast. 

To push the eastern boulder (at 39,9) west towards the fountain at eastsoutheast (which is probably a different location), the agent would need to move east, push it west. But the agent is at (38,9), so moving east to (39,9), then pushing west into (38,9). But that would just swap places, which isn't helpful. 

Alternatively, the southern boulder at (38,10) can be pushed north or northeast. If there's a fountain at (39,10) (eastsoutheast), pushing the boulder there. 

Alternatively, the agent could move south to (38,10), then try to push the boulder east or southeast. 

But considering the previous attempts to push west resulted in errors due to bars, maybe the correct action is to move towards the boulder that can be pushed into a fountain without hitting bars. 

Looking at the adjacent fountains: southwest and eastsoutheast. The southwest fountain is adjacent, so perhaps pushing a boulder from the west into that fountain. If the boulder is at (37,9), pushing it west into (36,9), but need to check if there's a bar there. The bars are near eastnortheast, etc., so maybe (36,9) is clear. 

But the agent is at (38,9), so to push the boulder at (37,9) west, the agent needs to be adjacent to it. The agent is at (38,9), so the boulder is to the west. To push it west, the agent would move west to (37,9), then push west again. But the previous attempt to push west from (38,9) was invalid due to bars. Wait, in the latest observation, after moving west to (37,9), the agent tried to push west again but got blocked by bars. So the boulder at (37,9) can't be pushed west because there's a bar in the way. 

Therefore, maybe the target is the boulder near southsoutheast. The agent is at (38,9). Moving south to (38,10), then perhaps pushing the boulder there east or northeast. 

In the map, at (38,10), there's a boulder very near southsoutheast. So maybe at (39,10) or (40,10). If the agent moves south to (38,10), then can push the boulder east towards the fountain at eastsoutheast. 

So the plan would be: move south to (38,10), then push east or southeast. 

Alternatively, since the agent is already at (38,9), maybe move south to (38,10), then check the boulder's position. 

But based on the current state, the best action might be to move south to interact with the boulder there. Alternatively, since the agent is adjacent to a fountain to the southwest, perhaps there's a boulder that can be pushed there from the west. 

Given the confusion in the map symbols and the previous errors when pushing west, perhaps the safest valid action is to move south to (38,10) where there's a boulder and a fountain nearby. 

So the chosen action is south.

I need to figure out the best action for the agent in this Boxoban-like game. Let me start by understanding the current state based on the observations provided.

The agent is at position (38,9) and moved south to (38,10) previously. The map shows some bars and a boulder in the vicinity. The goal is to push boulders onto fountains. Let me check the surrounding areas.

Looking at the language observation, there's a boulder very near the southeast and southsoutheast. Also, there's a fountain adjacent to the southwest. That suggests there's a fountain nearby that a boulder needs to be pushed onto. The bars are blocking some paths, so the agent needs to navigate around them.

The agent's inventory has various items, but the relevant ones for movement and pushing are the boulders. Since the agent was trying to move west earlier but got blocked by bars, maybe that's not the way. Alternatively, moving east might be possible if there's a clear path.

The cursor is now at (38,10), which is south of the previous position. The map shows symbols like {, ., @, which might represent different objects or features. The `@` typically denotes the player's position. The `<` and `>` could be other entities or goals.

The message history shows that pushing west resulted in getting blocked by bars. So moving west again isn't helpful. Moving east might lead towards the boulder in the southeast. Let me check the adjacent areas.

The bars are adjacent to north, northeast, east, and northwest. So moving north or northeast might hit bars. The fountain is adjacent to the southwest, so perhaps moving southwest could reach it, but there's a dark area near the southwest and west, which might be obstacles.

The stairs up are near westsouthwest, so maybe going back west to the stairs isn't the priority right now. The main goal is to push the boulder onto the fountain. The boulder is very near southsoutheast, so the agent should move towards that direction.

If the agent moves southeast, they might be able to reach the boulder. Let's verify the map layout. The agent is at (38,10). Moving southeast would take them to (39,11), but looking at the map's symbols, there's a `#` in some areas which might be walls or barriers. The map shows `##########` at the bottom, indicating walls surrounding that area. So moving southeast directly might hit a wall.

Alternatively, moving east from (38,10) to (39,10) could be possible if there's no bar or obstacle. The bars very near eastnortheast and east might be in that direction. The language observation mentions bars very near north, northeast, etc., so moving east could lead into bars again.

Wait, the bars are very near eastnortheast, east, southeast, and westnorthwest. So moving east from the agent's current position might hit the bars. But the boulder is near southsoutheast, so maybe moving south or southeast is the way to go.

Looking at the map again, the agent's current position is marked with `<.{@.{..#`. The `@` is the player. To the southeast, there's a `.{..#`, which might be a path. Maybe moving south to (38,11) is possible if there's no obstacle. But the dark area is far south, so perhaps moving south isn't safe.

Another option is to push the boulder. Since the boulder is very near southsoutheast, the agent needs to get next to it and push it towards the fountain. To do that, the agent might need to move in a direction that allows them to position themselves to push the boulder.

If the agent moves east to (39,10), but there are bars very near east, that might block. Alternatively, moving south to (38,11) and then east or southeast could reach the boulder. However, the dark area is far south, so perhaps moving south isn't advisable.

Alternatively, moving west to (37,10) and then south or east might open up a path. The agent was previously at (37,10) after moving west. From there, moving south could lead towards the fountain adjacent southwest.

Wait, the fountain is adjacent southwest. So if the agent moves southwest from (38,10), they would go to (37,11). But is that path clear? The language observation mentions dark area near southwest and west, so maybe there are obstacles there.

Alternatively, moving east and then south might allow the agent to reach the boulder. Let me think. If the agent moves east to (39,10), but there are bars very near east, so that's blocked. Maybe moving south to (38,11) and then east?

Looking at the map's symbols at (38,11), there's a `##...` which might be a path. So moving south to (38,11) is possible. From there, moving east might be feasible if there's no bar.

Once the agent is at (38,11), they can try to move east towards the boulder. If they can get adjacent to the boulder, they can push it south or southeast towards the fountain.

Alternatively, the agent could try to navigate around the bars to reach the boulder. Since the bars are in the north, northeast, east, and northwest, the agent might need to go around them by moving south or southwest.

In summary, the best approach seems to be:

1. Move south to (38,11) to avoid bars in the north and northeast.
2. From there, move east towards the boulder in the southeast.
3. Once adjacent to the boulder, push it south or southeast towards the fountain.

But need to check if the path is clear. The language observation says bars very near eastnortheast, east, etc., so moving east from (38,11) might still hit bars. Maybe moving southwest first to (37,11) and then east?

Alternatively, check the map symbols. At (38,11), the map shows `##...` which might mean a path. So moving south to (38,11) is safe. Then moving east to (39,11) could be possible if there's no bar. But the bars very near east would block that.

Hmm. Maybe the agent needs to find a different route. Let me look again at the language observation: bars very near eastnortheast, east, southeast, and westnorthwest. So moving east from (38,10) is blocked by bars. Moving southeast to (39,11) might also hit a bar.

Wait, the boulder is very near southsoutheast. So perhaps moving south to (38,11), then east to (39,11), but if there's a bar, that's not possible. Alternatively, moving south again to (38,12), but the dark area is far south, so maybe that's not safe.

Alternatively, the agent could move west to (37,10) and then south to (37,11), then east towards the boulder. Let's see: from (37,10), moving south to (37,11) is possible if there's no obstacle. The map at (37,11) shows `#<.{..{..#`, which might have a path.

Once at (37,11), moving east to (38,11) which has `##...`, then east again to (39,11). If there's a bar there, the agent can't proceed. But the goal is to get to the boulder near southsoutheast.

Alternatively, the agent could try to push the boulder from the current position. If the boulder is adjacent, pushing west or north might move it towards the fountain. But the agent is at (38,10), and the boulder is very near southsoutheast, which would be to the southeast direction.

Wait, the boulder is very near southsoutheast, so maybe it's at (39,11) or (40,12). The agent needs to move towards it. But the bars are in the way. So perhaps moving around the bars by going south first.

Another idea: The stairs up are near westsouthwest, which is at (36,8) perhaps. The agent could go back there, but the priority is to push the boulder onto the fountain.

Given all this, the best action might be to move south to (38,11) to clear the bar obstacles, then proceed east or southeast towards the boulder. However, since moving east is blocked, moving south and then east might be the way.

But looking at the map, moving east from (38,11) would lead to `##..###..#`, which includes `###` indicating walls or bars. So that's blocked.

Alternative path: Move south to (38,11), then west to (37,11), then east to (38,11) again. Not helpful.

Wait, the agent is at (38,10). If they move south to (38,11), then south again to (38,12), but the dark area is far south, so maybe that's not good. Alternatively, move southwest to (37,11).

From (38,10) moving southwest to (37,11) is possible if there's no obstacle. The map at (37,11) shows `#<.{..{..#`, which might allow movement. Then from (37,11), move east to (38,11), then perhaps southeast to (39,12).

But I'm getting a bit confused with the map coordinates. Let me try to visualize the map layout based on the provided map section.

The map has 9 rows (y=0 to 8) as per the indentation. Each row represents a horizontal slice. The agent's position is at (38,9), which is likely near the bottom of the map since y=9 is the last line. The map's last line is ""##########"", which could be a boundary wall.

Looking at the map rows:

Row y=9: ""##{.@##.`#""
Row y=10: ""#<.{@.{..#""
Row y=11: ""##...`#..#""
Etc.

The `@` is at position (38,10) as per the cursor. So moving south from there would take to y=11, which has ""##...`#..#"". 

The boulder is very near southsoutheast, which would be in the direction of increasing x and y. So perhaps at (39,11) or (40,12). The fountain is adjacent southwest, which would be at (37,10) or (37,9).

To reach the boulder, the agent needs to move southeast. From (38,10), moving southeast would be to (39,11). Checking the map at y=11, x=39 is `#`, which is a wall. So that's blocked.

Alternative route: Move south to (38,11), then east to (39,11). The map at y=11, x=39 is `.` which might be a floor. Then from there, move southeast to (40,12), but need to check if that's a valid path.

Alternatively, move south to (38,11), then west to (37,11), then east to (38,11), then south to (38,12).

This is getting complicated. Maybe the best immediate action is to move south to (38,11) to get past the northern bars, then try to move east towards the boulder, avoiding the southern bars.

So the chosen action would be to move south again to y=11.

The agent is stuck in the game trying to move through these bars and push the boulders onto the fountains. From the observations, the bars are blocking most directions, especially north, northeast, east, and northwest. The boulders are located southsoutheast and east, but the agent can't get past the bars to reach them.

Looking at the current position (38,11), the agent is on a map with a lot of bars around. The nearest fountain is adjacent to the northwest, so maybe moving towards there could help. The stairs up are to the westnorthwest, but the agent's goal is to push boulders onto fountains, not necessarily climb stairs.

The agent tried pushing west before but got blocked by bars. Now, the message says there's a boulder adjacent east. So maybe the agent should try pushing the boulder east towards the fountain. But to do that, the agent needs to move east first, then push the boulder.

Wait, the cursor is at (38,11), and the boulder is adjacent east. So east is possible if there's no obstacle. Let me check the map. The map shows at position (38,11), the character is '@' with a boulder to the east. The map line for that row is '#<.{..{..#' which might indicate the agent is in a certain tile. Moving east would take the agent to (39,11), and if there's a boulder there, they can push it.

But the bars are adjacent southeast and south. So moving east might not be blocked by bars immediately. The agent needs to move east, then push the boulder further east towards the fountain. Alternatively, if the boulder is already next to a fountain, pushing it there would solve the level.

So the plan is: move east to get next to the boulder, then push it east towards the fountain. But the agent needs to check if there's a clear path after pushing. Given the bars are in the way, maybe the fountain is in a direction where the boulder can be pushed without hitting bars.

Looking at the language observation, the fountain is adjacent northwest. That's the opposite direction of the boulder. So perhaps the boulder needs to be pushed to the southeast, where there's a fountain near southsoutheast. But the bars are blocking southsoutheast.

Wait, the boulder very near southsoutheast. So maybe the agent should move south to reach that area. But the bars are blocking south. The agent's current position is y=11, and moving south would take them to y=12, but there are bars southsouthwest and south. So south is blocked.

Alternative approach: move west to the stairs up, but that's not helpful. The main goal is to push boulders to fountains. The closest boulder is east, adjacent. So move east, then push east. But need to confirm if that direction is clear.

The bars are adjacent southeast and south, which would be (39,12) and (38,12). If the agent pushes the boulder east to (39,11), then checks if there's a path further east. The map shows #######..# which might be solid barriers, so pushing the boulder past that is impossible. Therefore, the only feasible option is to push the boulder towards the fountain in the southeast direction, but the bars are blocking that way.

Alternatively, maybe the fountain is in the eastsoutheast area. The language observation mentions fountain very near east and westnorthwest. So eastsoutheast might have a fountain. If the agent can push the boulder east into that area, that would solve the level.

So the steps would be: move east to reach the boulder, then push it east towards the fountain. But need to navigate around the bars. Since moving east from (38,11) is possible if there's no bar there. The bars are adjacent southeast and south, but east is clear.

Looking at the map row for y=11: the agent's position is at (38,11) which is part of the line ##..@`#..#. So moving east from (38,11) would go to (39,11), which is a '.' or another walkable tile. Then, pushing the boulder east into (40,11) towards the fountain.

But the problem is that after pushing, the boulder might get stuck behind bars. The bars are very near eastnortheast, east, southeast, and westnorthwest. So pushing east might lead the boulder into a position where it's blocked by bars, preventing it from reaching the fountain.

Alternatively, maybe the agent should move south first to get a better position. But the south is blocked by bars. So perhaps the only option is to push the boulder east as much as possible.

Another observation: the stairs up are near westsouthwest, but the agent's goal is to push boulders, not climb. So focusing on the boulder east.

In the current state, the agent is at (38,11), east has a boulder. So action should be to move east to get next to the boulder, then push east. But the previous attempts to push west failed due to bars. So the correct action now is to move east, then push east.

But the agent's last action was south, moving to (38,11). Now, the next step is to move east to (39,11), then push east towards the fountain. But need to check if that's allowed.

Given the bars are mostly south and southeast, moving east should be possible. So the chosen action would be 'east' to get next to the boulder, then 'push east'. However, since the agent can only output one action at a time, the first step is to move east.

94,push west,"<reasoning>
The agent is stuck trying to move the boulder but keeps failing. The last action was 'push east', which resulted in a message saying the boulder couldn't be moved. Let me look at the current observation.

The agent is at (38,11). The map shows a boulder adjacent to the east and southeast. The bars are all around, especially to the south and southeast. The message indicates that trying to push the boulder east didn't work. Maybe the boulder is blocked by another obstacle, or there's a bar in the way. 

Looking at the bars, they're very near the northeast, east, southeast, and southsoutheast. The boulder is adjacent to the east, so maybe there's a bar right behind it, preventing movement. The agent needs to find another way to move the boulder. Since pushing east didn't work, maybe trying a different direction? Let's check the bars again. The bars are also adjacent to the south, so pushing south might be blocked too. 

What about pushing west? The agent is at x=38, y=11. If they move west, they might be able to position themselves to push the boulder in another direction. Alternatively, moving north or south to find an opening. But the bars are all around. The agent's inventory has a blessed potion of extra healing and other items, but maybe that's not needed right now. 

The goal is to push boulders onto fountains. There's a fountain adjacent to the west. If the boulder can be moved west towards that fountain, that would solve the problem. But the boulder is currently east of the agent. To get it to the west, the agent might need to navigate around the bars. Since pushing east isn't working, maybe moving south or west to create a path. 

Wait, looking at the map, the agent is on a path with `##..@`#..#`, so there's a door or a barrier. The boulder is at `eastnortheast`, which is diagonal from the agent's current position. Maybe the agent needs to move south to get a better angle. Or perhaps there's a way to go around the bars to the westsouthwest stairs. 

Alternatively, since the stairs are up near westsouthwest, maybe moving west to get closer to the stairs and find another route. But the agent's main goal is to push the boulder to the fountain. Let's focus on that. The fountain is adjacent to the northwest, so perhaps moving the boulder north? But the bars are adjacent to the north and northeast. 

This is tricky. The agent might need to try pushing the boulder in a different direction, like south. If the boulder is at eastnortheast, pushing it south could move it towards the fountain in southeast. But the bars are also southsoutheast. Maybe there's a space there. Alternatively, the agent could move south to get under the boulder and try pushing again. 

Wait, the agent's current position is (38,11). The boulder is at eastnortheast, which would be (39,10) or similar. If the agent moves south to (38,12), maybe they can position themselves to push the boulder east again, but there are bars in the way. 

Another approach: since the agent tried pushing east and it failed, maybe the boulder is blocked by a bar. The agent could try to move around the bars to find a path. For example, moving west to (37,11) and then trying to push the boulder north or south. But the bars are adjacent to the northwest, so that might not help. 

Alternatively, the agent could use the stairs up at westsouthwest to go to another level, but the problem is on level 1. The main action needed here is to manipulate the boulder. Since pushing east isn't working, maybe trying a different direction. Let's check the bars again. The bars are very near northeast, east, southeast, and south. So pushing the boulder south might be blocked by bars. 

Wait, the fountain is adjacent to the northwest. If the boulder can be moved northwest towards the fountain, that would work. But the agent is at (38,11), and the boulder is at eastnortheast. To move the boulder northwest, the agent would need to push it in a northwest direction, which might require moving diagonally. However, in MiniHack, you can only push in cardinal directions. So the agent would have to push the boulder north or west, then adjust. 

If the agent moves north to (38,10), then pushes the boulder west, that might work. But the bars are north of the boulder. Let me visualize the map. The agent is at (38,11) with a boulder at (39,10) perhaps. The bars are to the northeast, east, etc. If the agent moves north to (38,10), then tries to push the boulder west, they might clear the path. 

Alternatively, the agent could try to move west to (37,11) and then push the boulder north. But the bars are to the northwest. This is getting complicated. Maybe the best bet is to keep trying different push directions, even if the immediate attempt fails. Since the previous push east didn't work, maybe trying push south or west. 

Alternatively, the agent could move around to the side of the boulder and try pushing in the right direction. For example, moving south to (38,12) and then pushing east, but there are bars there. 

Hmm. Given the current position and the obstacles, perhaps the best action is to try pushing the boulder south. If that's blocked by bars, then move west and try another direction. Alternatively, the agent could move north to get a better angle. 

Wait, the message says ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" which implies that the last push action was attempted but failed. The agent needs to find a different direction. Since pushing east didn't work, maybe pushing west. The agent is at (38,11). If they push west, the boulder would move to (37,11). Are there bars there? The bars are adjacent to the northwest, so (37,11) might be clear. 

Let me check the language observation: bars very near northnortheast, northeast, east, eastsoutheast, southsoutheast, south, and southsouthwest. So the area to the west of the agent (37,11) might not have bars. If the agent pushes west, the boulder would move to (37,11), which is adjacent to the fountain at northwest. That could work. 

So the action should be to push west. But the previous attempts to push west didn't work? Wait, looking at the history, the agent tried push west earlier and got the same message. Maybe the boulder is blocked by a bar behind it. The bars are very near northeast, east, etc., but maybe the path behind the boulder is clear. 

Alternatively, the agent needs to move around to the side of the boulder. For example, move south to (38,12) and then try pushing west. But there are bars southsoutheast. 

This is challenging. Given the information, the best guess is to try pushing west again, as it's the direction towards the fountain. If that's blocked, maybe try moving north and then pushing west. 

Alternatively, the agent could use the stairs to go down, but the problem is on level 1. 

Given the current situation, the safest action might be to push west again, hoping that the previous failure was due to an incorrect direction. Alternatively, try pushing south. 

But the message indicates that the boulder couldn't be moved east, so pushing in another direction is needed. Let's choose to push west again, as it's closer to the fountain.

",-0.001,False
95,south,"<reasoning>
Let's see. I need to figure out the best way to move in this Boxoban-like game. The goal is to push the boulders onto the fountains. First, I'll look at the current observations to understand the environment.

The agent is at position (38, 10). The map shows several bars blocking paths, a boulder near southsoutheast, and a fountain also in that area. There's a stairs up near westsouthwest, which might be where the player started. The inventory has some items, but I don't see any tools that would help move boulders other than walking into them.

The previous actions tried moving north, south, east, west, and pushing in various directions. However, some actions like ""push west"" weren't valid, possibly because there's a bar in the way. The latest message says that trying to push the boulder failed, which might mean the boulder is blocked by another obstacle or the agent isn't positioned correctly.

Looking at the map, the agent is currently facing a boulder marked with '@' at (38, 11). To push it west, the agent would need to be adjacent to the boulder and move in the direction opposite to where they want to push it. Since the agent is at (38, 10), moving south to (38, 11) would place them next to the boulder. Then, pushing west from there could work if there's no obstacle behind the boulder.

Wait, in the latest observation after moving south to y=11, the map shows the boulder at (38,11) with '@'. The agent needs to be next to the boulder to push it. So moving south again to get adjacent, then pushing west. But the last action was 'east' which kept the agent at (38,11). The message said ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain,"" which probably means the boulder wasn't pushed because the agent wasn't positioned correctly. Maybe the boulder is blocked by a bar or another obstacle behind it.

Looking at the language observation, bars are adjacent north, northeast, east, and northwest. So the agent is surrounded by bars on some sides, making it hard to push the boulder in certain directions. The fountain is adjacent to the southwest, so pushing the boulder west towards the fountain might be the goal.

But the agent is at (38,10) after moving north from (38,11). Maybe the correct path is to move south to get next to the boulder, then push west. However, the bars adjacent to the agent's current position might block that. Alternatively, maybe moving west first to get around the bars, but the bars are to the west and northwest, so that's probably not possible.

Another approach: check if the boulder is stuck because there's a bar behind it. If the boulder needs to be pushed west into the fountain, but there's a bar in the way, then the agent needs to find a way around. However, the bars are all around, so maybe the only feasible direction is south or east. But the fountain is to the southwest, so pushing the boulder west towards there.

Wait, the fountain is adjacent southwest. So if the boulder is pushed west, it would reach the fountain. But the agent needs to position themselves to push it. Let's see the map again. The agent is at (38,10), and the boulder is at (38,11). To push the boulder west, the agent needs to be at (38,11) and push west to (37,11). But there might be a bar at (37,11) blocking that path. Looking at the language observation, bars are adjacent north, northeast, east, and northwest of the agent's current position (38,10). Wait, the bars adjacent are north, northeast, east, and northwest. So at (38,10), moving west would go to (37,10), which might be a bar? Or is that a dark area?

The dark area is near southwest and west. The agent's current position (38,10) has bars adjacent to the east and northeast, so moving west might be possible if there's no bar. But according to the language observation, the bars are very near eastnortheast, east, southeast, and westnorthwest. So moving west from (38,10) to (37,10) might be blocked by a bar. Therefore, the agent can't move west directly.

Hmm. Maybe the agent needs to move south to (38,11) next to the boulder, then try pushing west from there. But when the agent tried moving east to (38,11) earlier, the message said they couldn't move the boulder. Maybe because the boulder is already west of where they tried to push. Alternatively, perhaps the boulder is blocked by another obstacle.

Another observation: the boulder is very near southsoutheast. So maybe there's another boulder there. The agent needs to push all boulders to their respective fountains. The fountain is in the southwest, so focusing on that.

Given the barriers, the most feasible path might be to move the boulder south into the fountain. But the fountain is southeast, according to some observations. Wait, earlier messages mentioned the fountain is near southsoutheast. So the boulder needs to be pushed towards there.

But the agent is at (38,10), and the boulder is at (38,11). To push it south, the agent would need to be at (38,11) and push south to (38,12). However, looking at the map, there's a long row of ###..# in the fourth line, which might be bars or walls blocking the path south.

Alternatively, maybe the agent should move north to avoid the boulder and find another way. But the bars are blocking north as well.

Given the constraints, perhaps the only way is to try pushing the boulder west again from (38,11). The agent needs to get there. So moving south to (38,11), then push west. But earlier attempt to push west failed. Maybe because there's a bar behind the boulder. Let's check the bars' positions. Bars are very near eastnortheast, east, southeast, and westnorthwest. So when pushing the boulder west from (38,11) to (37,11), there's a bar at westnorthwest, which might be at (37,11) or nearby. If there's a bar there, the boulder can't be pushed further west.

In that case, the boulder can only be pushed as far west as possible before hitting a bar. The fountain is adjacent southwest, which might be at (37,10) or similar. If the boulder is pushed to (37,11), and the fountain is at (37,10), then the boulder isn't on the fountain. So maybe the correct move is to push the boulder south into the fountain. But checking the map, the fourth line has ##..###..# which might be a barrier.

Alternatively, maybe the agent should explore other directions. Moving east might lead to a path, but the bars are adjacent east. Perhaps moving north to (38,9) where there are fewer barriers. Wait, the agent was at (38,9) earlier, but the bars are adjacent there as well.

Given the information, the best action seems to be moving south to get next to the boulder and then attempting to push it west, even if it only moves it partway. Alternatively, trying a different direction if west is blocked. But since the fountain is southwest, pushing west is the right direction.

So the action plan is: move south to (38,11), then push west to (37,11). If that's blocked by a bar, then maybe push in another direction. But based on the latest observation, the agent is at (38,10) and the boulder is at (38,11). So moving south once more to (38,11), then push west.

Let me try to figure out what the agent should do next in this Boxoban-like environment. The goal is to push the boulders onto the fountains.

First, looking at the current observation, the agent is at position (38, 11). The map shows a grid with various obstacles like bars and dark areas. The boulders are near southsoutheast and eastnortheast. The fountains are located at southeast and eastsoutheast.

The agent's previous actions have been moving around, trying to push a boulder to the east, but it failed because the boulder couldn't be moved, possibly due to another obstacle or a wall. The message ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" suggests that there's something blocking the boulder's path when the agent tried to push it west.

Looking at the map, the current position has a '@' which represents the agent. To the east is a boulder ('<'), but pushing it further east isn't working. Maybe there's a bar or another obstacle there. The agent needs to navigate around to find a way to reposition the boulder towards the fountain.

The fountain is at southeast, which is likely south of the current position. The agent should move towards the southeast direction to reach the fountain. However, there are bars and dark areas blocking the path. The agent needs to find a clear route.

The cursor's position is (38,11), and the stairs up are near westsouthwest. But the priority is pushing the boulder. Let's check the adjacent cells. South of the agent is a '.' which is an open floor. Moving south might be a good idea to get closer to the boulder or find a better path.

Alternatively, checking the language observation, the boulder adjacent to east, so to the east of the agent is the boulder. But trying to push it west didn't work, so maybe the path is blocked. The agent needs to move around the boulder. Moving south first could allow the agent to position themselves to the west of the boulder, then try pushing it west towards the fountain.

Another option is to move west to see if there's an alternative path. The stairs up are in westsouthwest, but that might not be necessary right now. The immediate task is to push the boulder to the fountain.

So, possible actions: move south to get a better angle, or move west to check the surroundings. Since the agent was trying to push east and failed, moving south might help to approach the boulder from another direction.

Looking at the map, the agent is at y=11. Moving south would take them to y=12. The cell south of the agent (38,12) is likely an open floor (based on the map's structure). Moving south would allow the agent to be below the boulder, perhaps enabling a push to the west or south.

Alternatively, moving west to (37,11) might be possible if that cell isn't blocked. Checking the map, the cell to the west (37,11) has a '#' which could be a wall or obstacle. So moving west might not be feasible.

Therefore, the best immediate action is to move south to y=12, giving the agent a better position to interact with the boulder to the east. Once south, the agent can attempt to push the boulder west towards the fountain at southeast.

Let's see. I need to solve Boxoban in this environment. The goal is to push all the boulders onto the fountains. From the observations, there's a boulder to the southeast and one at southsoutheast. The fountains are in the southsoutheast and southeast.

Looking at the map, the player is at (38, 11). The boulder is at (38, 11) currently, marked with '@'. Wait, the map shows '##..@`#..#' on row 3 (y=10?), but the cursor is at (38, 11). Maybe the coordinates are a bit different. Let me check the map layout again. The map has multiple rows, each representing a y-coordinate. The player's position is (38, 11), which is somewhere in the middle of the map.

The bars are surrounding a lot of areas, making it hard to move freely. The stairs up are near westsouthwest, so maybe the exit is there, but the priority is to push the boulders onto fountains.

The boulder adjacent east (probably at (39, 11)) is stuck because there are bars to the south and southeast. The message says ""You cannot pass through the bars,"" so pushing the boulder east is blocked by bars. The other boulder is at southsoutheast, which might be near the fountain there.

The player needs to navigate around the bars to reach the boulders. Since moving east is blocked by bars, maybe moving west or south could help. But the player is already at (38, 11), and moving south again might not help. Alternatively, going west to (37, 11) could allow accessing the boulder at (38, 11) and pushing it west, but there are bars to the northwest and west.

Wait, the boulder at (38, 11) is adjacent to east, which is blocked. To push it west, the player needs to be to the west of it. So the player is at (38, 11), the boulder is at (38, 11) as well? That doesn't make sense. Maybe the '@' represents the player, and the boulder is elsewhere. Let me check the map again.

In the map, the third row (y=3) is '##{.@##.`#', which might be the player's position. But the cursor says (38, 9) in some observations. This is confusing. Maybe the map's coordinate system is different. Alternatively, the '@' in the map might be the player, and the boulder is marked differently, like a '{' or another character. Looking at the map, there's a '<' which might be the player icon. In the latest map, the line with '<' is: '#<.{..{..#', which would be at y=9 perhaps. The cursor is at (38,9) in some observations. 

This is getting a bit tangled. Let me focus on the actionable steps. The player needs to push boulders onto fountains. The boulders are near southsoutheast, and there's a fountain there. The player is currently at (38,9) or (38,10) in various observations. The bars are blocking movement to the east and south. 

Possible actions: Try to move around the bars to reach the boulders. For example, move west to get past the bars, then south to reach the boulder. Alternatively, look for a path that allows pushing the boulder towards the fountain. Since pushing the boulder east is blocked by bars, maybe push it south or west. 

In the last observation, the player is at (38,11), and the boulder is adjacent east. So the boulder is at (39,11), blocked by bars to the south and southeast. To push it west, the player needs to be at (38,11) and move west, but the boulder is already there. Wait, maybe the '@' is the player, and the boulder is marked with another character. Let me check the map again. In the map provided, the line with the '@' is '##..@`#..#' which is at y=10 (since the cursor was at y=10 in one observation). So the player is at (38,10) with the boulder at (38,10) as '@', but that can't be right. Maybe the '@' is the boulder, and the player is '<'. 

This is confusing due to the coordinate system and map symbols. Assuming the player is the '<' icon, which was at (38,9) in some observations. The boulders are marked with '{' perhaps. Looking at the map, there's a '{' in various places. For example, in the line '#<.{..{..#', the '{' are boulders. So the player needs to move to the position of these boulders and push them towards the fountains.

The fountain is at southsoutheast, so the boulder there should be pushed onto it. The bars are making it difficult, but perhaps there's a path. The player might need to move west to avoid the bars, then south to reach the boulder. Once adjacent, push it south or west towards the fountain.

Given the previous actions, the agent tried moving south, west, east, etc., but encountered bars. The latest valid action was 'south' to get to (38,11). Now, the player is at (38,11), and the boulder is adjacent east (39,11), blocked by bars to the south. So pushing west might not be possible. Alternatively, move south again to get past the bars, or find another route.

Another approach: Since the stairs up are near westsouthwest, maybe the exit is there, but the goal is to push boulders, not to climb stairs. So the priority remains pushing boulders.

If the player moves west from (38,11) to (37,11), then perhaps can navigate around the bars. Then move south to reach the boulder at (38,11) and push it west. But the bars are adjacent southeast and south, so moving south from (38,11) might hit a bar.

Alternatively, move west to (37,11), then south to (37,12), avoiding bars. Check the map for obstacles. The map's lower rows are filled with '#######`{#' etc., indicating walls or bars. So moving south from (37,11) might be blocked.

Given the complexity, the safest action might be to continue moving south to see if there's a path, or try to move west to navigate around the bars. However, the previous attempts to move east or push resulted in errors due to bars.

Considering all this, the next logical action is to move west to (37,11) to get closer to the boulder and try pushing it west when possible.

The agent is trying to solve Boxoban by pushing boulders onto fountains. The current observation shows the agent's position at (37, 11) and the map has several bars and a boulder marked with @. The message indicates that moving the boulder didn't work, so maybe it's blocked by bars or another obstacle.

Looking at the map, the boulder is at (38, 11) based on the previous observations. The agent was trying to push it west, but there are bars to the south and southeast, which might be blocking the path. The fountains are near eastsoutheast and northwest, so the goal is to get the boulder to one of those.

The agent's last move was ""south"" which didn't result in any change, and then tried pushing west again but it failed because of the bars. Now, the agent is at (37, 11). The bars are adjacent to the southeast, so maybe the boulder is stuck between the bars and the agent. 

To proceed, the agent needs to find a way to move around the bars. Since the bars are blocking the direct path, perhaps moving north or west could help. But looking at the map, the agent is already at the edge of the visible area. There's a stairs up near westnorthwest, which might be an exit, but the priority is pushing the boulder.

The boulder is at (38, 11), and the agent is at (37, 11). To push the boulder west, the agent needs to be adjacent to it and move towards the west direction. However, the bars are adjacent to the southeast, which might mean the boulder is against the bars. If the bars are solid, the boulder can't move further west. So maybe the agent needs to move north or south to position themselves to push the boulder in a different direction.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to move the boulder north or south around the bars. If the agent moves north, they might be able to get around the bars and then push the boulder in another direction. Let me check the language observation again. The bars are very near northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, and northwest. So the area around the boulder is pretty confined with bars.

Another option is to look for other boulders. The current boulder is at (38, 11), and there's another one near southeast. Maybe the agent should focus on that one first, but the primary goal is to get the boulder onto the fountain. The fountain near eastsoutheast might be a target. 

Wait, the boulder is at (38, 11) and the fountain is near eastsoutheast, which is in the opposite direction. So pushing the boulder west isn't helping. Maybe the agent needs to move the boulder east instead. But east is blocked by bars. Hmm.

Wait, the message says ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" So the last attempt to push west failed because the boulder is blocked. The bars are adjacent to the southeast, so perhaps the boulder is against the bars, making it impossible to push further west. Therefore, the agent needs to find another way to move the boulder, maybe by moving it north or south around the bars.

Looking at the map, the boulder is at (38, 11) with @. The agent is at (37, 11). If the agent moves north to (37, 10), they might be able to get around the bars and then push the boulder west from there. But the bars are adjacent to the southeast, so moving north might not reveal a path. Alternatively, moving south could lead to more bars.

Another approach is to check if there are any other fountains. The language observation mentions a fountain very near eastnortheast and northwest. The agent's current position is (37, 11), and the fountain near eastnortheast would be to the east. Maybe pushing the boulder east towards that fountain, but east is blocked by bars. 

Alternatively, the agent could move west to get closer to the stairs up and perhaps find another pathway. But the main goal is to push the boulder onto a fountain. Since pushing west isn't working, the agent should try a different direction. Maybe pushing south? Let me see. If the agent moves south to (38, 12), they could attempt to push the boulder south. But the map shows bars near southsoutheast and south, so that might be blocked as well.

Alternatively, the agent could move north to (37, 10) and then try pushing the boulder west from there. If the bars are only to the southeast, moving north might clear the path. The map's north area isn't fully visible, but the language observation mentions dark areas far north. 

Considering all this, the best immediate action might be to move north to position the agent adjacent to the boulder and then try pushing it west again, hoping the bars aren't in the way now. Alternatively, move west to (36, 11) and see if there's a clearer path. 

But looking at the cursor position after the previous steps, the agent is at (37, 11). If they move north to (37, 10), they can then attempt to push the boulder west again. The bars are adjacent to the southeast, so moving north might avoid those bars temporarily. 

Another possibility is that the boulder is already on a fountain, but the observation doesn't indicate that. The fountains are near eastsoutheast and northwest, so the current boulder's position isn't on a fountain. 

Given the constraints, the most logical action is to move the agent north to (37, 10) and then try pushing the boulder west again. Alternatively, move west to (36, 11) to see if there's a path. However, the agent needs to avoid repeating the same actions without progress. 

Given that the last few actions were pushing west and south, which didn't work, the agent should try a different direction. Moving north seems like a viable option to explore a new path.

Let's try to figure out what to do next here. The agent is in Boxoban, a Sokoban-like game. The goal is to push all the boulders onto the fountains. The current observation shows the agent's position at (37,10), and the map has various bars, dark areas, and a fountain nearby.

Looking at the map, there's a boulder at (38,11) marked with '@'. The agent is at (37,10). The nearest fountain seems to be to the east, maybe at (38,10) or similar. The bars are blocking some paths, especially to the south and southeast. 

The agent tried pushing west before, but there were bars in the way. Now, they're back at (37,10). The inventory shows some items, but maybe not relevant for movement. The key is to get the boulder to the fountain. 

The boulder is to the east. To push it, the agent needs to move towards it. But the path east from (37,10) is blocked by bars very near northeast. So maybe the agent should move south to get around the bars. Alternatively, check if there's a way to push the boulder west, but the agent was there before and hit bars. 

Another option is to move south to y=11, where the boulder is. From (37,10) moving south to (37,11), but the message says ""You cannot pass through the bars"" when moving south earlier. Wait, the latest observation after moving south to y=11 had a message about bars, so that's blocked. So maybe the agent needs to navigate around the bars. 

Alternatively, check if the boulder can be pushed east when there's space. The boulder is at (38,11). To push it east, the agent would need to be adjacent and move east. But the agent is at (37,10), which is north-west of the boulder. So moving south to (37,11) first, but that's blocked. Maybe move east to (38,10) and then push the boulder south or east. 

Wait, the map shows at (38,11) there's a boulder with '@'. The agent is at (37,10). To get to the boulder, they need to move south to (37,11), but that's blocked by bars. So perhaps the agent needs to go around via west or north. 

Looking at the language observation, the bars are adjacent to north, northeast, east, and northwest. The agent is at (37,10). The stairs up are near westsouthwest, so maybe moving west to reduce proximity to bars. 

Alternatively, try to move south again but find another path. Since the previous attempt to move south from (38,11) was blocked by bars, maybe the agent should move east to (38,10), then south to (38,11), and try to push the boulder west or east. 

But the boulder at (38,11) is adjacent to bars to the south and southeast. So pushing it east might be possible if there's space beyond the bars. However, the observation mentions bars very near east, southeast, etc., so maybe pushing the boulder east isn't feasible. 

Another approach: The fountain is near east. If the agent can push the boulder to the east side, perhaps onto the fountain. To do that, the agent needs to move the boulder from (38,11) to a position where it's over a fountain. The latest observation shows a fountain adjacent to west, so maybe moving the boulder west towards the fountain. 

But the agent is at (37,10), west of the boulder. To push the boulder west, the agent would need to be to the west of it. The current position is west of the boulder's x-coordinate (37 vs. 38). So the agent is at x=37, boulder at x=38. To push west, the agent needs to be east of the boulder. Wait, no: in Boxoban, you push by moving into the boulder, which then moves in the direction you're coming from. So if the agent is at (38,10) and moves east into the boulder at (38,11), the boulder would move east to (39,11), but there might be bars there. 

Alternatively, the agent could move south to (37,11), but that's blocked. Maybe the best move is to move east to (38,10), then south to (38,11), and then try to push the boulder east or west. 

But given the previous attempts to push west resulted in errors due to bars, perhaps the agent should try to push the boulder east. If the boulder is moved east to (39,11), but there are bars nearby, that might not work. Alternatively, check if there's a fountain east of the boulder. 

Looking at the language observation, there's a fountain very near east and westnorthwest. So maybe the fountain is at (39,11) or similar. If the agent can push the boulder east past the bars, that could work. But the bars are very near eastnortheast, east, etc., so moving the boulder east might hit a bar. 

Alternatively, the agent could try to move around the bars to the north and push the boulder south. But the bars are adjacent to north, so that's not possible. 

Another idea: The agent's current position is (37,10). If they move south to (37,11), but that's blocked. Maybe move west to (36,10) and then see if they can approach the boulder from the north. 

But the cursor's position after previous moves was (38,9) then moving south to (38,10), etc. The latest observation after moving north was at (37,10). 

Considering all this, perhaps the best immediate action is to move south again to see if there's an alternative path, but that might be blocked. Alternatively, move east to (38,10) and then attempt to push the boulder south or east. 

Wait, the boulder is at (38,11). If the agent moves east to (38,10), then south to (38,11), they can then try to push it east. Let's see: from (38,11), pushing east would move it to (39,11). If there are no obstacles there, that's good. But the language observation says bars very near east, so maybe (39,11) is blocked. 

Alternatively, push the boulder west from (38,11) to (37,11), but the agent is at (37,10). To push west, the agent needs to be to the east of the boulder. So from (38,10), move south to (38,11), then push west into (37,11). But (37,11) might be blocked by bars. 

Looking at the map, at (37,11) there's a `#` which might be a wall or bar. The agent earlier tried moving south to (38,11) and got a message about bars, so perhaps (38,11) is blocked to the south. 

This is getting a bit confusing. Maybe the best approach is to move the agent closer to the boulder and attempt to push it in a direction that's clear. Given the agent is at (37,10), moving east to (38,10), then south to (38,11), and then try to push west or east. 

But since pushing west earlier resulted in an error due to bars, maybe pushing east is the way. However, the bars being very near east might block that. 

Alternatively, check if there's a fountain to the north. The language observation mentions a fountain adjacent to northwest. So maybe moving the boulder northwest. 

The agent could try to move north to (37,9), then west to (36,9), and approach the boulder from the north-west. But that's a longer path. 

Given the time constraints and the need to avoid repeating actions, perhaps the best next action is to move east to (38,10) to get closer to the boulder and then decide the push direction.
