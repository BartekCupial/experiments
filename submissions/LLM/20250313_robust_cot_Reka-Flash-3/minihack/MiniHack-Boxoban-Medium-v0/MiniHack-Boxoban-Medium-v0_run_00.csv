The game is Boxoban, a box-pushing game. My goal is to push the boulders onto the fountains. I need to look at the map and find the boulder and the fountains.

Looking at the message and the map description, there's a boulder far westsouthwest and another near westnorthwest. The fountains are also mentioned in the same areas. The cursor shows my position at (41,13). I need to figure out the layout here.

The map has a lot of bars and dark areas. The bars are probably walls. The player is in a position where they need to navigate to the boulders. Let me try to visualize the map. The agent is probably near the center or the west side. The boulders are westsouthwest, which is to the southwest direction. The fountains are in the westnorthwest, which is northwest. So maybe the layout is a grid where the boulders are in one corner and the fountains in another.

The first step is to move towards the boulder. Since the boulder is far westsouthwest, I should go west first. But maybe check if there's a path. The bars are near various directions, so I need to avoid them. The message mentions bars very near north, northeast, etc., which might block movement.

My current position is (41,13). To go westsouthwest, I need to move west multiple times. Let's see, each move west would decrease the x-coordinate. Let's try moving west first. If there's a bar or a wall, I can't move there. The observation says that the boulder is adjacent west, so maybe there's a boulder right next to me west side. Wait, the message says ""boulder adjacent west"". So if I'm at (41,13), west would be (40,13). That's where the boulder is. But to push it, I need to move into it, but only if there's space behind it.

The goal is to push the boulder onto the fountain. So first, I need to position myself to push the boulder. Since the boulder is adjacent west, I need to stand next to it. But I'm already at (41,13). Wait, the cursor shows myself as a samurai at (41,13). If the boulder is adjacent west, then moving west would take me to (40,13), which is the boulder. So I can push it by moving west into it. But I need to check if there's space behind the boulder in the west direction. If the boulder is at (40,13), pushing it west would take it to (39,13). Is there a fountain there?

The fountains are in the westnorthwest area. Let me see the message again: ""fountain far westnorthwest"" and ""fountains near westsouthwest"". Wait, maybe the westsouthwest has a fountain near it? Or is the boulder in westsouthwest and the fountain in westnorthwest? That would mean pushing the boulder to the northwest direction. Wait, this is a bit confusing. Let me parse the message again.

Message details:
- boulder far westsouthwest
- fountain far westnorthwest
- boulder near west and westnorthwest
- fountain near west

So there's a boulder in the far westsouthwest, another nearby west and westnorthwest. The fountains are in the far westnorthwest and near west. Maybe the layout has two boulders and two fountains. But the goal is to push all boulders onto fountains.

Assuming the boulder adjacent west is the one near westsouthwest, pushing it west would move it towards westsouthwest direction. But the fountain is in westnorthwest, which is northwest. So maybe that's the wrong direction. Alternatively, perhaps the boulder is near westnorthwest and needs to be pushed to the fountain there.

Wait, the message says ""boulder near west and westnorthwest"". So there's a boulder near west (which is adjacent to the player's current position) and another near westnorthwest. The fountains are near west and westsouthwest. So perhaps the player has to move the boulder from the west (adjacent) to the westnorthwest fountain. Let's see.

If the player is at (41,13), moving west to (40,13) is the adjacent boulder. To push it, the player needs to move west into it. But where is the space behind the boulder? If the boulder is at (40,13), pushing it west would take it to (39,13). Is there a fountain there? The message mentions a fountain near westsouthwest. If westsouthwest is southwest of the player's position, then (39,13) might be westsouthwest. But the fountain is far westnorthwest. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the boulder adjacent west is the one that needs to be pushed towards the westnorthwest fountain. So after pushing it west, it would go to (39,13), but then maybe from there, push further north or something. But not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the player should first move towards the westnorthwest area where the fountain is. Let's think about the directions.

The player's position is (41,13). West is towards lower x, north is towards lower y. So westsouthwest would be southwest direction. To get to the westnorthwest (northwest), the player would need to move north and west.

But first, the adjacent boulder is to the west. Let's try to push it. If I move west into the boulder, it will push it to (39,13). Then maybe from there, push it further north or west. But the fountain is in the westnorthwest, which would be (39,12) perhaps. So after pushing the boulder to (39,13), moving it north to (39,12) would place it on the fountain.

So the steps would be:

1. Move west into the boulder at (40,13), pushing it to (39,13).
2. Move north from (40,13) to (40,12), then move north again to (40,11), but maybe need to adjust direction.
Wait, after pushing the boulder to (39,13), the player is now at (40,13). To push it further north, the player needs to be next to it. So move north to (40,12), then push the boulder north to (39,12). Then if (39,12) is a fountain, that's the goal.

But I need to confirm if (39,12) is indeed a fountain. The message says ""fountain far westnorthwest"". If the player's position is (41,13), then westnorthwest would be moving west and north. Let's calculate:

Westnorthwest from (41,13) would be decreasing x and y. So (40,12) is northwest, (39,11) is westnorthwest. But the fountain is far westnorthwest, which might be (39,11). So pushing the boulder from (39,13) to (39,12) would not reach the fountain. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the fountain is at (39,13) southwest direction. Wait, the message mentions ""fountain near west"" which is adjacent west, but that's where the boulder is. This is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should focus on pushing the boulder towards the fountain mentioned in the message.

The message says ""fountains near westsouthwest"". So if the boulder is pushed to the westsouthwest, it would reach a fountain. The player's current position is (41,13). Westsouthwest would be moving west and south. So from (41,13), moving west once to (40,13) (the boulder), then pushing it west to (39,13), then maybe south to (39,14), but that area might be dark or have bars.

Alternatively, perhaps after pushing the boulder west to (39,13), the player can move south to (39,14) and then push it further south? But the message mentions a fountain near westsouthwest. Let me check the map description again.

The map shows a lot of bars and some dark areas. The agent is in the center of the map as per the map grid shown, which has many empty spaces and bars. The exact positions of fountains and boulders might be in specific coordinates. However, without the actual ASCII map, it's a bit hard to tell. But based on the message, the fountains are in westsouthwest and westnorthwest.

Given that the adjacent boulder is to the west, the best immediate action is to push it towards a fountain. The fountain near westsouthwest is the target. So pushing the boulder west once would move it to (39,13). Then, perhaps moving south to (39,14) and pushing again? Or maybe the fountain is at (39,13) southwest. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the player should first move to a different position to avoid being blocked by bars. The message mentions bars very near north, northeast, etc., which might block movement in those directions. The player's current position has bars near north, northeast, east, southeast, etc. So moving north or northeast is likely blocked. Therefore, the safe initial move is west to push the boulder.

So the first action should be to move west into the boulder, pushing it to the west. That would be action: west.

But wait, the tip says not to output the same action over and over if nothing changes. So after pushing the boulder, the player would need to move around it to push further. But for the first action, just pushing the boulder west is the immediate step.

Let's see. The agent is in a Boxoban-style environment where the goal is to push boulders onto fountains. The current observation shows that after moving west, the agent is now at position (40, 13). The map has a lot of bars (walls) and a boulder adjacent to the west. The stairs up are adjacent to the east, which might be relevant for exiting once the boulders are placed.

First, I need to check where the boulders and fountains are located. The previous observation mentioned a boulder far westsouthwest and near west and westnorthwest. The fountains are near westnorthwest and westsouthwest. So, the goal is to move the boulders to those fountain locations.

Since the agent moved west once and is now adjacent to a boulder west of them (x=40, y=13), the boulder is at (39,13). The fountain is near westnorthwest, which might be at a position like (38,12) or similar. To push the boulder towards the fountain, the agent needs to move in the direction opposite to the boulder's position until there's space to push it. Wait, no. Wait, the agent is at (40,13) and the boulder is adjacent west, so at (39,13). To push the boulder west, the agent needs to move west into it, but they can only do that if there's no obstacle behind the boulder. So the agent should check what's behind the boulder. The map shows bars adjacent to north, northeast, east, southeast, south, and northwest at (40,13). The boulder is at (39,13), so behind it (west direction, towards (38,13)) is probably open or a fountain. The fountain is near westnorthwest, which might be at (38,12) or (38,14). If pushing the boulder west from (39,13) to (38,13), that square should be a fountain. So the agent can push the boulder west into the fountain.

But wait, the agent is at (40,13), and the boulder is at (39,13). To push the boulder west, the agent needs to move west into the boulder, which would then move the boulder west. So the agent's next move should be 'west' again to push the boulder. However, the previous action was 'west', and moving west again might not change anything if the boulder is already there. But according to the current observation, the boulder is adjacent west, so moving west again would push it. Let me confirm the map. The map at (40,13) has the agent's position marked with '@', and the boulder is west of that, so at (39,13). The map line for that row (y=13) is #.`{.`@<## — let's parse this. Each character represents a position. The agent is at position 6 (assuming the line is indexed from 0 or 1). Let's see: the line is ""#.`{.`@<##"". Let's count the characters. Assuming each '#' is a wall, then the positions are:

0: #
1: .
2: `
3: {
4: .
5: `
6: @ (agent)
7: <
8: #
9: #
10: #
So the boulder is at position 7, which is '<' in the map. Wait, but the agent is at position 6 (x=40, y=13). So moving west would take the agent to x=39, y=13, which is the boulder's position (the '<' character). So pushing the boulder would require moving into it, which would then move the boulder west (to x=38, y=13). The question is, is there a fountain there? The fountains are near westnorthwest, which might be at (38,12) or (38,14). Let's check the map. The fountain is near west, which in this case would be to the west of the agent's current position. The map's other lines might show the fountain locations. Looking at the map provided, the fountains are mentioned in the language observation, but the actual map doesn't show them explicitly. However, the agent's goal is to push the boulders onto fountains. So the agent should push the boulder west towards a fountain.

Therefore, the correct action here is to move west again to push the boulder. However, the tip says not to repeat the same action if nothing changes. But in this case, moving west again would result in the boulder being pushed, which is a valid action. The previous action was 'west', leading to the boulder being adjacent. Now, moving west again would push it. So the next action should be 'west' again. Alternatively, check if there's another boulder to handle, but based on the current observation, there's only one boulder adjacent. So the agent should push it west towards the fountain.

Let's tackle this Boxoban problem. The goal is to push the boulder onto the fountain. From the observations, I need to track the positions of the boulder, the fountain, and the agent's location.

Looking at the latest map, the agent is at (39,13). The boulder is very near westnorthwest, which I think is to the west and a bit north. The fountain is very near westsouthwest, which is southwest of the boulder. There's also stairs up near east, but that's probably not relevant right now.

The last few actions were moving west three times. Now the agent is at (39,13). The boulder is adjacent west. So if I move west again, the boulder would be behind me. Wait, in the map, the agent's position is marked with <, so after moving west three times from (41,13) to (40,13) to (39,13), the next west would take to (38,13). The boulder is adjacent west, meaning it's at (38,13). 

So, if I move west now, I would be at (38,13), and the boulder is there. To push it, I need to walk into it. But I need to make sure there's space behind the boulder. Looking at the map, after pushing, the boulder should move west to (37,13). Is there a fountain there? The fountain is at westsouthwest, which might be (39,14) or similar. Wait, the fountain's position isn't exactly clear. Let me check the language observation again. It says fountain very near westsouthwest and west. The boulder is at westnorthwest, so maybe the fountain is a bit further south. 

If I push the boulder west, it would move towards the fountain. Let's assume that pushing it west into (37,13) would place it closer to the fountain. Then, maybe after pushing, I can move around to position myself to push it again towards the fountain. Alternatively, if there's a clear path west from the boulder after pushing, that's the way to go. 

The stairs are east, but getting the boulder on the fountain is the priority. So the best action now is to move west to push the boulder. The action would be ""west"" again. But wait, the tip says not to repeat the same action if nothing changes. But in this case, moving west is necessary to push the boulder. Since the boulder is adjacent, moving west would result in pushing it. The previous actions were moving west three times, but each time the boulder was getting closer. So repeating west is necessary here. 

I think the correct action is to move west again to push the boulder towards the fountain.

Let's try to figure out what the agent should do next. The user is playing Boxoban, so the goal is to push boulders onto fountains. The observations show the agent moving west repeatedly. From the map, it looks like the agent is steadily moving west towards some obstacles.

Looking at the current position (x=38, y=13), the agent is facing a boulder adjacent to the west and northwest. The stairs up are near the east, so maybe moving towards the boulder is necessary to push it towards a fountain.

The last few actions were west, and each time the agent moved closer to the boulder. Now, the boulder is adjacent to the west, so the next step should be to push it. In Boxoban, you push a boulder by moving into it if there's space behind it. The tooltip says you can push if there's no obstacle behind.

Looking at the map, after pushing the boulder west, where would it go? The map shows a fountain very near southwest and westsouthwest. If the boulder is pushed west from (38,13), it would move to (37,13). The adjacent positions after that would need to be checked for obstacles. From the language observation, there's a fountain very near southwest, so maybe pushing the boulder west into a fountain would solve the level.

So the agent should push the boulder west. To do that, the correct action is to move west, which would push the boulder west. The action to push is done by moving towards the boulder when there's space behind. Since the boulder is adjacent west, moving west again should push it.

Let's see where I am right now. The agent has been moving west multiple times. The last observation shows that after moving west to (38,13), there's a boulder adjacent to the west and northwest. But when the agent tried to move the boulder, it failed. Why did that happen?

Looking at the map, the agent is surrounded by bars and dark areas. The boulders are near westsouthwest and very near west. The fountain is at westnorthwest and southwest. The stairs are up near east. The agent's position is (38,13). The boulder adjacent to the west means there's a boulder directly west of the agent. But the agent just tried to push it and failed. Why?

Possible reasons: Maybe the boulder is stuck against another obstacle, like a wall or another boulder. Or maybe there's something in the way behind the boulder that prevents it from being pushed. The message says ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" So the action of pushing west (the direction of the boulder) didn't work.

The agent needs to check the surroundings again. The bars are adjacent to northeast and southeast. The fountain is adjacent to southwest. So maybe pushing the boulder isn't the right move here. The goal is to push boulders onto fountains, so perhaps the current boulder isn't near a fountain yet. Or maybe the agent is not positioned correctly to push it towards a fountain.

Alternatively, maybe the boulder is in a spot where pushing it would cause it to go into a dark area or another obstacle. The agent should look for fountains nearby where the boulder can be pushed. The fountain is at westnorthwest and southwest. If the agent can move in a direction that allows pushing the boulder towards one of those fountains, that would be better.

But the agent is at (38,13). The boulder is adjacent west, so at (37,13). The fountain at westnorthwest would be further north and west? Wait, the map's coordinates might be a bit confusing. Let me parse the map again. The agent's position is (38,13). The map shows that as the center of the visible area. Looking at the map rows and columns, perhaps moving west again would reach the boulder, but trying to push it didn't work. Maybe the boulder is blocked.

Another thought: the agent tried to push west, which is the direction towards the boulder. If the boulder is against a wall, then pushing it wouldn't work. But according to the observations, the boulder is adjacent west, meaning there's space to push. Unless there's another obstacle behind it. The language observation mentions bars adjacent to northeast and southeast. Maybe the bars are blocking the path behind the boulder.

Wait, the bars are very near north, northeast, etc. So the agent's current position is in a corridor with bars surrounding it. To push the boulder west, the agent needs to be next to it and have space behind it. Since the push failed, perhaps the agent isn't positioned correctly. Maybe the boulder is in a corner where pushing it west would go into a wall or another obstacle.

Alternatively, the boulder might be too heavy for the agent's strength. But the agent's strength is 18, which is pretty high, so that's unlikely. The message didn't mention anything about strength, just that the movement failed.

In the current state, the agent is at (38,13), with a boulder at (37,13). The agent tried to push west (to move itself west, which would push the boulder west to (36,13)), but it failed. So maybe there's a bar or another boulder at (36,13). The language observation says bars adjacent to northeast and southeast, but maybe there's a bar at (36,13) blocking the path.

Alternatively, the boulder is stuck against a wall. The map's visible area shows that the agent is in a part of the dungeon with many bars. The map rows have characters like # and - which represent walls or bars. Let me look at the map again. In the current map display, the agent's position is marked with @ and is surrounded by # symbols, suggesting walls. So perhaps the boulder is against a wall, making it impossible to push further west.

If that's the case, the agent can't push the boulder west anymore. Then the next step would be to try pushing it in another direction, like north or south, if possible. But the agent needs to check if there's space in those directions.

Looking at the cursor's position and the map, the agent is in a cell that's surrounded by # to the north, south, east, and possibly west. The boulder is adjacent west, so the agent is next to it, but the cell beyond the boulder (west) might be a wall. Hence, the push failed.

In that case, the agent should try a different approach. Maybe move to a different position where the boulder can be pushed towards a fountain. For example, moving north or south to reposition, then trying to push the boulder in that direction.

Alternatively, check if there's a fountain nearby that the boulder can be pushed onto. The fountains are at westnorthwest and southwest. The agent's current position is (38,13). The southwest fountain would be to the southwest direction, perhaps (38,14) or similar. But the agent needs to navigate there and push the boulder accordingly.

Another possibility is that the agent needs to pick up a key or open a door to access more of the map, but the current observations don't mention any locked doors or keys.

Since the agent has been moving west multiple times and the boulder is now adjacent, but can't be pushed, the next logical step is to explore other directions. Maybe moving north or south to see if there's a path to a fountain where the boulder can be placed.

Looking at the language observation, there are fountains very near southwest. The agent's current position is (38,13), so southwest would be (37,14) maybe. If the agent can move south to (38,14) and then west to (37,14), perhaps they can position the boulder there.

Alternatively, the agent could try moving north to see if there's a path towards the westnorthwest fountain.

But given that the agent is surrounded by bars and walls, maybe the best bet is to find a way to move the boulder south or north. However, the current observations don't indicate any clear paths in those directions.

Wait, the stairs up are adjacent east. So the agent could move east towards the stairs, but that might take them away from the boulder. The goal is to push the boulder onto a fountain, so staying near the boulder is better.

Another thought: maybe the agent needs to use a different action, like using the katana to break something blocking the boulder's path. But the agent's inventory has a katana and yumi (bow), but breaking bars might require a different approach. However, the problem states that pushing is the way to go, and using tools might not be necessary here.

Alternatively, check if the boulder is already on a fountain. The language observation mentions a fountain very near southwest. If the boulder is there, then the agent's goal is achieved. But from the map, the boulder is at westsouthwest, which might not be the same as the southwest fountain.

Given the confusion in map coordinates, perhaps the best move is to try pushing the boulder in a different direction. Since pushing west didn't work, maybe try pushing north or south. But the agent needs to check if there's space in those directions.

Looking at the cursor's position and the map, the agent's current cell is surrounded by # to the north, east, south, and possibly west. The boulder is to the west, but pushing it there didn't work. So maybe the agent should move north or south to get a different angle on the boulder.

For example, moving north to (38,12) and then trying to push the boulder west from there. But the map shows that the agent is in a cell with # to the north, so moving north might be against a wall.

Alternatively, move south to (38,14) and then try to push the boulder west. If the cell to the southwest (37,14) is passable, then pushing the boulder there could place it on the fountain.

Given that the agent's last action was west, leading to position (38,13), and the push failed, the next step could be to try moving in a different direction. Let's consider moving south to (38,14) and then attempt to push the boulder west from there. If that's possible, it might allow the boulder to be placed on the fountain.

Another option is to move northwest, but the agent's movement options are only north, east, south, west. So northwest would be a combination, but the allowed actions are only the four directions.

In conclusion, the agent should try moving south to reposition and then attempt to push the boulder west again, hopefully into the fountain located southwest.

",-0.001,False
5,north,"<reasoning>
Let's see where I am. The agent has been moving west multiple times, stopping when they hit a boulder. The last message said trying to move the boulder failed. Now the agent is at (38,14) after moving south once. The map shows some structures with bars and fountains. The goal is to push boulders onto fountains.

First, looking at the current position: (38,14). The boulder is adjacent to the agent (west and northwest). The last attempt to move the boulder failed, so maybe there's an obstacle behind it? The description mentions bars very near northnortheast, etc., and stairs up near eastnortheast. 

The agent needs to navigate to the boulder and push it towards a fountain. The fountains are at westsouthwest and westnorthwest. The boulder is at westnorthwest (very near), so maybe pushing it towards westnorthwest fountain. But the agent tried west before and got blocked. Wait, the last observation after moving west three times showed the boulder adjacent west. Then moving west again tried to push but failed. So the boulder is to the west, but maybe there's another obstacle behind it, preventing movement.

Now after moving south to (38,14), perhaps moving west again? But the previous attempt failed. Alternatively, check if there's a way around. Maybe move north or east to get a different angle. The bars are adjacent east, southeast, south, southwest. So moving east might lead to stairs up. But the stairs are up, which is probably a way out, but the goal is to push the boulders. So maybe focus on the boulder first.

Looking at the map, the agent is at position 38,14. The map shows a '#' character in some areas, which might be walls or obstacles. The '@' is the agent. The boulder is adjacent west, so position 37,13 or similar. To push the boulder, the agent needs to be next to it and move in the direction opposite to where the boulder is. Since the boulder is west, the agent is east of it. To push it west, the agent needs to move west into it, but that's where the agent was trying before. However, the last attempt failed because there's something blocking the boulder's path west. Maybe another boulder or a wall.

Alternatively, check if the boulder can be pushed south or north. But the agent is at (38,14), so if the boulder is at (38,13), pushing it west would be to (37,13), but the message said trying to move it failed. So perhaps there's a wall at (37,13) or another obstacle. In that case, the agent might need to move around to the side of the boulder to push it in a different direction.

Since the agent is at (38,14), maybe moving north or south to get a different position relative to the boulder. For example, moving north to (38,13) and then trying to push the boulder west from there. But the current message after moving south shows the agent at (38,14). Let me check the map again. The map line for y=14 has #`.{@#.... which suggests that at (38,14), the agent is next to a # (wall) on the west side. Wait, the map in the current observation shows at position y=14, the line is ""#`.{@#......."", so the agent is at position x=38, y=14, which is the '@' between a '.' and a '#'. So to the west of the agent (x=37, y=14) is a '.', but the boulder is adjacent west, which would be x=37, y=13 perhaps? Because the boulder's position is adjacent west of the agent. 

Wait, the boulder adjacent west would be in the same row, x=37, y=14. But according to the last observation, after moving west three times, the agent was at (38,13), and the boulder was adjacent west. Then when trying to push, it failed. Now after moving south to (38,14), the boulder is adjacent west again. So the boulder is at (37,14). But the agent is trying to push it west to (36,14), but there's a wall at (36,14) because the map shows a '#' at that position. That explains why the push failed. 

So the agent needs to find a way to move the boulder around the wall. Since the boulder is at (37,14), and the wall is at (36,14), pushing west isn't possible. Maybe push the boulder north or south. The agent is at (38,14). To push north, the agent would need to be at (38,13) and move north, pushing the boulder to (37,13). But the agent is currently at (38,14). So maybe move north to (38,13), then try to push the boulder west. However, the previous attempt when the agent was at (38,13) tried west and failed. Wait, no—the agent was at (38,13) after three west moves, then tried to push west but failed because the boulder couldn't move west due to a wall at (37,13). 

So the boulder is stuck between a wall to the west and perhaps another obstacle. To get the boulder off that spot, the agent needs to move it in a different direction. Let's think: if the boulder is at (37,14), and the agent is at (38,14), pushing it north to (37,13) might be possible if there's no obstacle there. The map shows at y=13, the line is ""#.`{.#.###"", which at x=37 is a '.'. So (37,13) is a floor, not a wall. Therefore, pushing the boulder north from (37,14) to (37,13) could work. To do that, the agent needs to be north of the boulder. So the agent should move north to (38,13), then attempt to push the boulder north. 

But in the current observation after moving south to (38,14), the agent is facing south. Wait, the map shows the agent at (38,14) with '@' in the line for y=14. The line is ""#`.{@#......."", so the agent is between a '.' and a '#'. To move north would take the agent to (38,13), which is a '.' according to the map's y=13 line: ""#.`{.#.###"". So (38,13) is a floor. Then, from (38,13), the agent can try to push the boulder west. Wait, but the boulder is at (37,14), so the agent needs to be adjacent to it. If the agent is at (38,13), the boulder is two steps to the west and one step north. That's not adjacent. So maybe moving the agent to (37,14) west of the boulder. But the agent can't walk through the boulder. Alternatively, move the agent to (37,13), which is north of the boulder. Then, from (37,13), pushing the boulder north to (37,12), but that might not be towards a fountain. 

Alternatively, perhaps the agent should head towards the fountain at westsouthwest. The fountains are at westsouthwest, which might be at a lower coordinate in x and higher in y. The agent is at (38,14). To reach westsouthwest, moving west and south. But the boulder is blocking the direct path. So maybe first move the boulder out of the way. 

Another approach: check if the agent can push the boulder south. The boulder is at (37,14). If the agent moves to (37,14) west of the boulder, then pushes south to (37,15). But the map's y=15 line is ""#...######"", which at x=37 is a '#', so that's a wall. Can't push there. 

Alternatively, push the boulder east. But the agent is already east of the boulder, and pushing east would take it into the agent's current position. That doesn't make sense. 

Hmm. So the boulder is stuck between a wall to the west and possibly a barrier to the north. The agent needs to find a way to move it either north or south. Since pushing north to (37,13) is possible, the agent should move north to (38,13), then try to push the boulder north. But how to get the agent to be north of the boulder? The boulder is at (37,14), so the agent needs to be at (37,13) to push it north. But the agent is currently at (38,14). 

To get to (37,13), the agent can move west once to (37,14), but that's where the boulder is. Can't walk through. So instead, move north to (38,13), then west to (37,13), which is a floor. Then, from (37,13), push the boulder north to (37,12). Check if (37,12) is a floor. The map's y=12 line is ""##########"", which is all walls. So can't push there. 

This is tricky. Maybe the agent should look for another boulder or interact with the environment differently. Wait, there's another boulder very near westnorthwest. The agent's current position is (38,14). The westnorthwest direction would be towards (36,12) or similar. Not sure. 

Alternatively, check the stairs up near eastnortheast. Maybe going up the stairs would end the level, but the goal is to push boulders onto fountains. So the agent should prioritize that. 

Another idea: since the agent can't push the boulder west or north, maybe move around it to the east and push it in another direction. But the agent is already east of the boulder. 

Wait, in the current position (38,14), the agent is at x=38, y=14. The boulder is adjacent west (x=37, y=14). The agent can try to move south to (38,15), but looking at the map's y=15 line, it's all walls. So that's not possible. 

Maybe the agent needs to move north to (38,13), then west to (37,13), then try to push the boulder north to (37,12), but as before, that's a wall. 

Alternatively, push the boulder south to (37,15). The map's y=15 line at x=37 is a '#', so can't. 

This seems like a dead end. Maybe the agent should look for another boulder or a different approach. Wait, the initial observations mentioned a boulder far westsouthwest and another near west. Maybe there are multiple boulders. The agent's focus is on the one adjacent west. 

Alternatively, the agent could try to move in a different direction to find a path. For example, move east towards the stairs up, but that might not help with the boulders. 

Wait, the message after the last failed push said ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" So the boulder can't be moved west because of a wall. The agent needs to find a way to move the boulder north or south. 

Looking back at the map's y=13 line: ""#.`{.#.###"". At x=37, it's a '.', so (37,13) is a floor. So pushing the boulder from (37,14) to (37,13) is possible if the agent can get north of the boulder. 

To do that, the agent needs to move to (37,13). From current position (38,14), move north to (38,13), then west to (37,13). Then, push the boulder north to (37,12), but that's a wall. So instead, push the boulder east? But the agent is already east of the boulder. 

Hmm. Maybe the agent should move to (37,13), then push the boulder east into (38,13). But (38,13) is a '.' according to the map's y=13 line. So pushing east from (37,13) to (38,13) is possible. That would move the boulder east, away from the wall. Then, the agent can try to push it west again. 

Let me outline the steps:

1. From (38,14), move north to (38,13).
2. From (38,13), move west to (37,13).
3. Push the boulder east from (37,14) to (38,14). Now the boulder is at (38,14), and the agent is at (37,13).
4. Then move west to (38,14) (where the boulder is now), but that's occupied. Maybe move north or south. 

Alternatively, after step 3, the boulder is at (38,14), same as the agent's previous position. Then the agent can try to push it west again from (38,14) to (37,14), but that's where the agent was before. Not helpful. 

This approach might not resolve the issue. Maybe there's another way. 

Alternatively, check if there's a way to push the boulder into a fountain. The fountains are at westsouthwest and westnorthwest. The agent is at (38,14). The westnorthwest fountain is likely at a lower x and lower y. For example, (34,12) or similar. The boulder adjacent west is at (37,14), which is closer to the agent than the fountain. So moving the boulder towards the fountain would require going west and south. But the boulder is blocked by the wall to the west. 

Perhaps the agent needs to move the boulder south into a position where it can be pushed west into a fountain. But the boulder's current position is (37,14). Pushing south would take it to (37,15), which is a wall. 

This seems stuck. Maybe the agent should look for another boulder or interact with items. The inventory has a katana, wakizashi, yumi, and ya arrows. Maybe using the yumi to shoot something, but the goal is to push boulders. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent can dig or kick, but the available actions are only movement. The problem states the possible actions are north, east, south, west. 

Wait, the user mentioned that the agent is playing Boxoban, so the standard Sokoban mechanics apply. To push a boulder, the agent must be behind it and the space behind it must be free. 

In the current situation, the boulder is at (37,14), agent at (38,14). To push west, need the space at (36,14) to be free. But according to the map, (36,14) is a '#', so it's a wall. Hence, can't push. 

Therefore, the agent must find a way to move the boulder north or south. But pushing north to (37,13) is possible. So the steps would be:

1. Move agent to (38,13).
2. Move west to (37,13).
3. Push boulder north to (37,12) – but (37,12) is a wall.
4. Alternatively, push boulder east to (38,13) – which is a free space. 

If the agent pushes the boulder east to (38,13), then the boulder is now at (38,13), and the agent can move into (38,14) again. But that doesn't help with the fountain. 

Alternatively, after pushing the boulder east to (38,13), the agent can move to (38,13) and then try to push it further east or another direction. 

But the fountain is at westsouthwest, which is in the opposite direction. Maybe the other boulder near westsouthwest is the one that needs to be pushed. 

The initial observations mentioned a boulder far westsouthwest. The current boulder the agent is trying to move is near west. Maybe there are two boulders. The agent should focus on the one that can be moved towards a fountain. 

Given the complexity, perhaps the best immediate action is to move the agent north to (38,13), then attempt to push the boulder north into (37,13). Even though that space is free, it doesn't get the boulder closer to a fountain. Alternatively, move the boulder east to (38,13), creating space. 

But without knowing the exact layout of the fountains, it's hard to say. The agent's priority is to push boulders onto fountains. The current boulder is stuck, so maybe the agent should move to the other boulder mentioned in the observations. 

Looking back at the language observation, there's a boulder far westsouthwest and near west and westnorthwest. The agent is currently dealing with the one near west. The other boulder far westsouthwest might be the target. 

To reach that boulder, the agent needs to move west and south. But the path might be blocked by bars and walls. 

Alternatively, the agent can try to find a path around the current boulder to reach the other one. 

But given the current position and the immediate obstacle, the best action might be to move north to (38,13) to get a better angle on the boulder, then attempt to push it north or east. 

So the next action would be north to (38,13), then west to (37,13), then push north. But since the agent can only take one action per step, the first step is to move north from (38,14) to (38,13). Then, from there, move west, then push. 

But the user is asking for the next action based on the current observation, which is after moving south to (38,14). The current map shows the agent at (38,14) with a boulder adjacent west. The agent needs to decide the next move. 

Given that pushing west failed, the agent should try to move around the boulder. The best next step is to move north to (38,13), which is a free space ('.'), allowing the agent to get north of the boulder and try pushing it north. 

So the chosen action is north.

",-0.001,False
6,south,"<reasoning>
Let's try to figure out what to do next. The agent is in a Boxoban-like environment, pushing boulders onto fountains. The current position is (38,13). Looking at the map, there's a boulder adjacent to the west and northwest. The agent just tried moving west repeatedly but hit a boulder when at (38,13). Moving west again would try to push that boulder, but the message said it's in vain, so maybe there's something blocking it.

The stairs are up to the east, but the goal is to push the boulder onto the fountain. The fountain is at westnorthwest, and there's a boulder very near westnorthwest. The agent needs to get that boulder to the fountain. 

Since moving west wasn't working, maybe moving south or north could create a path. Let's check the map again. The agent is at (38,13). If they move south to (38,14), the map shows a '@' there, but also some bars and a fountain west. Wait, the cursor position after moving south was (38,14), and the map showed #``...<##. Not sure if that's a path. 

Alternatively, maybe moving north from (38,13) would allow accessing a different part of the map. The north direction might lead to a passage where the boulder can be pushed. But the previous attempt to move north didn't change much. 

Another idea: check if the boulder adjacent to the northwest can be moved. Since the agent is at (38,13), northwest would be (37,12), but the boulder is adjacent to west and northwest. Maybe the agent needs to position themselves so they can push the boulder in the right direction. 

Wait, the message when trying to move west said ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" That probably means there's an obstacle behind the boulder. So the agent needs to clear the path behind the boulder. Maybe moving south or north to get around? 

Alternatively, check the fountain locations. The main fountain is at westnorthwest. The boulder near westnorthwest might need to be pushed there. So perhaps moving northwest to approach that boulder. But the agent's current position is (38,13), so moving northwest would take them to (37,12), but is that passable? The map has bars very near north, northeast, etc., so maybe that path is blocked. 

Looking at the language observations, there are bars adjacent to northeast, southeast, south, and southwest at (38,13). So moving in those directions might hit bars. The only open directions might be north or west, but west is blocked by the boulder. 

Wait, the agent tried moving west three times, ending up at (38,13) again after the third attempt. The boulder is adjacent west, so moving west would try to push it, but it's stuck. Maybe the block behind the boulder is a wall or another obstacle. 

So, the agent needs to find another way to position the boulder. Maybe move south to (38,14) and see if there's a path there. From the map, at (38,14), there's a `@` followed by <##, which might be an open path. If the agent moves south, they can then try pushing the boulder in a different direction. 

Alternatively, move north to (38,12) and see if that path is clear. The map shows #`.{.#.### at line 7, which might correspond to y=12. Not sure. 

Another approach: since the stairs are up east, maybe the goal is to get the boulder to the fountain on this level, then use the stairs to proceed. The priority is pushing the boulder to the fountain. 

Looking at the current state, the boulder very near westnorthwest is adjacent to the agent's current position. If the agent can move northwest to get beside that boulder, they could push it towards the fountain. But how to get there? The agent is at (38,13). Moving northwest would require going to (37,12), but need to check if that's passable. 

From the map, line 8 at y=12 is #.{#######, which is a solid wall. So moving northwest from (38,13) to (37,12) is blocked by a wall. Hmm. So that's not possible. 

Alternative route: move south to (38,14), then see if they can move west from there. The map at (38,14) shows #.``...<##, which might have an open path west. If the agent moves south to (38,14), then perhaps they can move west into that path and push the boulder. 

But when the agent moved south previously, they ended up at (38,14) and the map showed #.``...<##. The '<' might indicate the agent's position there. If the agent is at (38,14), moving west would take them to (37,14). Let's check if that's passable. The map for y=14 is #`.{@#.###, which at x=37 is a '{', so maybe a door or a wall. 

This is getting a bit confusing. Maybe the best bet is to try moving south again to (38,14) and see if there's a path west from there. Alternatively, try moving north to see if that opens up a different route. 

Alternatively, since the boulder is adjacent west, maybe the agent needs to move in a different direction to create space. For example, move south, then try pushing the boulder north or east. 

Wait, the agent's inventory has a yumi (bow) and ya (arrows), but pushing boulders typically requires being behind them. Since the agent is a samurai, they can attack with the katana or bow, but the main task is to push boulders. 

Another thought: the fountain is at westnorthwest, which is probably up north a bit. The agent is currently south of that area. So maybe moving north would allow them to approach the boulder and the fountain. 

But earlier attempts to move north didn't change the position, suggesting maybe a wall is blocking. Let me check the map again. The map line for y=13 is #.`{.#.###, which at x=38 is a '.' (floor), so moving north from (38,13) to (38,12) would be into #`.{.#.### at x=38, which is a '.'? Wait, no. The y-coordinate in the map might be inverted. Typically, in game maps, the first line is the top, so lower y-values are north. But in the given map, the agent's position is at y=13. Looking at the map lines:

Line 4: #...###### (y=4)
Line 5: #{.`.##### (y=5)
Line 6: #.`{..`@## (y=6) → agent's position at y=6?
Wait, the user's initial observation had the agent at (41, y=13), but in the subsequent steps, after moving west, the position changed to x=40, y=13, then x=39, y=13, etc. But the map lines are labeled from top to bottom as lines 4 to 12, perhaps. This is a bit confusing. Maybe the map's y=13 corresponds to a certain line. 

Alternatively, perhaps the map's structure is such that each line represents a row in the game, with the agent's position (x,y) corresponding to the column and row in the map. For example, in the initial map, the agent's position is at (41,13), which might be near the bottom of the map provided. The map has 12 lines (from line 4 to line 15?), but the exact layout is unclear. 

This ambiguity makes it harder to navigate, but the key is to push the boulder onto the fountain. The agent is stuck trying to move west into a boulder. Maybe the solution is to move in a different direction to position the boulder. 

Since moving west isn't working, perhaps move south to create space. Then, from there, try pushing the boulder in another direction. For example, move south to (38,14), then maybe move west into a corridor and push the boulder north towards the fountain. 

Alternatively, check if the boulder adjacent northwest can be moved. The agent is at (38,13). Moving northwest would be to (37,12), but that's a wall. So that's not possible. 

Another approach: since there's a stairs up to the east, maybe the goal is to get the boulder to the fountain on this level first, then use the stairs. The agent needs to focus on pushing the boulder at (westsouthwest) onto the fountain at (westnorthwest). 

But the boulder at westsouthwest is adjacent to the agent's current position. When the agent tried moving west, they were trying to push that boulder. The message said it's in vain, meaning there's an obstacle behind it. So the agent needs to clear that obstacle. 

Maybe moving south to (38,14) and then trying to move west from there. If the path is clear, the agent can push the boulder south or north. 

Alternatively, check if the boulder can be pushed east. But east is blocked by bars and stairs. 

Given the limited information, the best action might be to move south to (38,14) and then see if pushing the boulder is possible from there. Alternatively, move north to see if there's a way around. 

But looking at the previous observation after moving south, the map shows #.``...<## at (38,14). The '<' might indicate the agent's position there. If the agent moves south again, they might be stuck. So maybe try pushing the boulder in a different direction. 

Alternatively, since the boulder is adjacent west, maybe the agent needs to move northwest around it. But that's blocked by a wall. 

Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe the correct action is to move south and then try pushing the boulder in a different direction. Let's try that.

7,west,"<reasoning>
Let's see. The agent is in Boxoban, which is similar to Sokoban. The goal is to push boulders onto fountains. The player's current position is (38,14), moving south from (38,13) where there was a boulder adjacent to the west and northwest. The map shows some bars (walls), dark areas, and fountains. Let's look at the observations again.

In the current state, the agent is at (38,14). The message history shows that trying to move west into the boulder at (38,13) resulted in a failure. Now, looking at the map, the agent's position is marked with @..<##. The boulders are adjacent to the west and northwest. The fountains are near westsouthwest and westnorthwest. 

The agent needs to push the boulder towards the fountains. Since the boulder is adjacent to the west (same y-coordinate, x=37), moving west again isn't possible. But maybe moving south or another direction could allow pushing the boulder. Alternatively, check if there's a way to navigate around the boulders to reach the fountains.

The stairs up are near eastnortheast, so that's probably an exit but not relevant for the current box pushing. The dark areas might block movement in some directions. The agent's inventory includes a katana, yumi, and arrows, but those might not be needed here since the task is pushing boxes.

The best move would be to try pushing the boulder. Since the boulder is adjacent west, moving west would just hit it. To push it, the agent needs to move into the boulder, which requires that there's space behind it. Looking at the map, after (38,13) west is (37,13). Is there space there? The map shows at (38,13) the position is `.` (floor), so maybe (37,13) is a floor or a fountain. If that's a floor, then moving west into the boulder would push it to (36,13), which could be towards a fountain.

But in the previous step, moving west from (38,13) resulted in a message that the boulder couldn't be moved. Wait, the message was ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" So, that suggests that when the agent tried to move west (into the boulder), there was no space behind the boulder to push it. So the boulder is blocked by another obstacle, like a wall or another boulder.

Looking at the current map, at (38,13) the agent is at `@..<##`. The `<` might indicate the direction of some feature, but the boulder is adjacent west. Let me check the adjacent positions. The boulder is adjacent west, so at (37,13). The position behind the boulder (36,13) must be blocked, otherwise the agent could push it. So perhaps there's a wall or another boulder there.

In that case, the agent can't push the current boulder west. So need to find another way. Maybe move south or north to reposition. The agent is currently at (38,14). Moving south to (38,15) might reveal if there's a path. Alternatively, moving east to get around the boulder. But the previous steps showed that moving east led to stairs up, but maybe there's a way to go around.

Another approach: check if there's a fountain nearby that the boulder can be pushed onto. The fountains are at westnorthwest and westsouthwest. The boulder adjacent west (37,13) needs to be pushed towards westsouthwest, which might be at a lower coordinate in x or y. If the fountain is to the south of the boulder, the agent could push it south.

But the map's layout isn't fully visible. The agent is in a dark area far north, west, and northwest, so perhaps the fountains are in a different part of the map. The agent's current position is in a corridor with bars (walls) around. Maybe moving south to explore further or east to find a path.

Alternatively, the agent could try to move the boulder to the northwest. If the boulder is at (37,13), pushing it northwest would be to (36,12). But is there space there? The agent would need to position themselves to push it in that direction. However, the agent is at (38,14), so moving northwest from there would be to (37,13), which is where the boulder is. That might not help.

Wait, the agent is at (38,14). If they move north to (38,13), which has the boulder adjacent west. From there, maybe move west and then push the boulder. But earlier attempt failed. So perhaps the boulder is blocked. The agent needs to find another boulder or clear a path.

Alternatively, check if there's another boulder nearby that needs to be moved first. The language observation mentions a boulder very near westnorthwest and northnorthwest. Maybe moving to that boulder and pushing it towards a fountain.

But the current priority is to interact with the boulder at (37,13). Since pushing west didn't work, perhaps try pushing it in another direction. For example, pushing it south into a fountain. To do that, the agent needs to move towards the boulder, possibly from the south. The agent is at (38,14), so moving south to (38,15) and then west to (37,15), allowing them to push the boulder south into (37,14). But this is speculative without seeing the map clearly.

Alternatively, the agent could move east to get a different vantage point. The stairs up are near eastnortheast, so moving east might lead to them, but that's not helpful for pushing boxes. The agent needs to focus on the boulders and fountains.

In the previous step, the agent moved south to (38,14), and the boulder is still adjacent west. The message didn't indicate any change. The best action might be to try pushing the boulder again but from a different direction. If moving west again doesn't work, perhaps moving south into the boulder's position and then pushing it south.

Wait, the agent is at (38,14). If they move west to (37,14), then they can attempt to push the boulder at (37,13) south into (37,12). But first, they need to move into position. So the sequence would be: move west to (37,14), then move west into the boulder (37,13), which would push it to (37,12). But this requires that (37,12) is a floor or fountain.

Alternatively, check if (37,13) is a boulder and (37,12) is a floor. If so, pushing it south would be possible. The agent needs to verify the map layout.

Given the uncertainty, the safest action is to attempt to push the boulder in a direction where there's space. Since previous attempts to push west failed, maybe try pushing it north or south. But without knowing the map's obstacles, it's risky.

Another possibility is that the agent is stuck in a loop moving west and then south and north. The tip says not to repeat actions if nothing changes. The agent has been moving west multiple times, which isn't effective. So perhaps a different approach is needed. Maybe move east to the stairs and then use them, but that's not helpful for the box pushing.

Alternatively, check if there's a fountain nearby that the boulder can be pushed onto. The fountains are at westnorthwest and westsouthwest. If the agent can push the boulder towards those locations, that would solve the level. Let's assume westsouthwest is south of the current position. The agent could move south and then west to reposition.

Alternatively, the agent could try to move the other boulder mentioned in the language observation, the one very near westnorthwest and northnorthwest. Moving towards that boulder and pushing it towards its fountain.

But the immediate boulder at (37,13) is adjacent, so focusing on that first. Since pushing west didn't work, perhaps try moving south to (38,15) and then west to (37,15), allowing a push south into (37,14). If (37,14) is a floor, then this could work.

In the current observation, after moving south to (38,14), the map shows #.``...<## at that position. The `<` might indicate a direction, perhaps a corridor. Moving west from here to (37,14) would be entering the `...` part. If that's a floor, then the agent can move west and attempt to push the boulder.

So the plan is: move south to (38,14), then west to (37,14), then west into the boulder at (37,13), pushing it to (37,12). If that position is a floor or fountain, this would progress the game.

But need to check the map again. The agent's current map at (38,14) is #.``...<##. The `<` is at position (38,14), so moving west from there would go into the `...` area. Assuming that's a path, the agent can move west.

So the next action should be west to get into position to push the boulder.

8,Failed to obtain a valid action from the reasoning.,"<reasoning>
Let me try to figure out what to do next. The agent is in a Boxoban-like game, needing to push boulders onto fountains. The current position is (37,14). Let's look at the map and observations.

From the map, the agent is near some boulders. The observation mentions a boulder very near north and west. Also, there's a fountain to the southwest. The cursor is at (37,14), and the agent's inventory has a katana and some yumi (bows), but pushing boulders requires using the body, not weapons.

The previous actions were moving west multiple times, then south, north, and west again. But the last move to west resulted in a boulder being adjacent. The message about trying to move the boulder but failing suggests that the agent is next to a boulder but there's an obstacle behind it, making it impossible to push. 

Looking at the current map, the agent is at position 37,14. To the west (position 36,14) there's a boulder. But the agent needs to check if there's space behind the boulder to push it. The observation says the boulder is adjacent northwest. So maybe the boulder is to the northwest, meaning the agent is south of it. If the agent moves north, they could potentially push the boulder north if there's space. 

Wait, the language observation mentions ""boulder adjacent north and northwest."" So the boulder is directly north and to the northwest of the agent. So the agent is at (37,14), and the boulder is at (37,13) and (36,13) or similar. To push the boulder north, the agent would need to move north into the boulder, which would require the space north of the boulder (e.g., (37,12)) to be unobstructed. 

Checking the map, the line for y=13 has a #`.@.#.###, which might indicate walls or obstacles. If the space north of the boulder is a wall or another obstacle, the agent can't push. The bars and dark areas might block movement. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent should try to move in a different direction to create space. For example, moving south might allow accessing a different part of the map where there are fountains. The stairs up are near eastnortheast, but the goal is to push boulders onto fountains. 

Another approach: since the agent is near a boulder, perhaps they need to position themselves to push it towards a fountain. The fountain is very near the southwest, so maybe moving west or southwest could help. But the agent has already moved west multiple times and encountered the boulder. 

Wait, the latest observation shows the boulder adjacent north and northwest. So if the agent is at (37,14), the boulder could be at (37,13) and (36,13). To push the boulder north to (37,12), the agent needs to move north into it, and there must be nothing at (37,12). Looking at the map, the line for y=12 is part of the ########## structure, which are probably walls. So (37,12) is a wall, making it impossible to push the boulder north. 

In that case, the agent can't push the boulder north. Maybe they need to move around it. Since the boulder is also to the northwest (36,13), perhaps moving west to (36,14) could allow accessing the boulder from the side. But the agent just moved west to (37,14) from (38,14). Wait, the previous moves were west, south, north, south, west again to (37,14). 

The agent's current position is (37,14), with a boulder at (37,13) and (36,13). The fountain is at southwest, so maybe moving southwest would be better, but the dark area and bars might block that. Alternatively, moving east to get a different perspective. 

Wait, the stairs are up near eastnortheast, but the primary goal is to push boulders. The agent should focus on interacting with the boulder. Since pushing north is blocked by a wall, perhaps moving south to (37,15) and then pushing the boulder south into a fountain. 

Looking at the map, y=15 might be another row of ##########, which are walls. So moving south might not work. Alternatively, moving west to (36,14) and then trying to push the boulder northwest. 

But the boulder is at (36,13), so if the agent moves to (36,14), they can try to push it north to (36,12), but again, checking the map for y=12, it's a wall. So that's blocked. 

Hmm. Maybe the agent should look for another boulder. The observation mentions another boulder very near north and west. Wait, the latest observation after moving west to (37,14) says ""boulder very near north and west."" So maybe there's another boulder to the west of (37,14), like at (36,14). 

If the agent moves west again to (36,14), they could be next to that boulder. Then, perhaps push it. But where is the fountain? The fountain is very near southwest, so maybe after pushing the boulder, move it towards there. 

Alternatively, check if there's a path to the fountain. The southwest has a fountain, but the agent is surrounded by bars and dark areas, which might be walls or passages. 

Another possibility: the agent needs to use the yumi (bow) to maybe break obstacles, but the inventory has 26 ya arrows. However, the goal is to push boulders, not destroy walls. So using the bow might not be necessary here. 

Wait, the message when trying to move the boulder earlier was ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" That suggests that there's something blocking the boulder's path. So the agent needs to ensure that behind the boulder (the side they're pushing it to) is clear. 

If the agent is trying to push the boulder north but there's a wall, they can't. So maybe they need to move around to the side where pushing is possible. For example, if the boulder is at (37,13), pushing it east into a fountain if there's a fountain there. But the observation says the fountain is very near the southwest. 

Alternatively, perhaps the agent should move south to a different part of the map where there are fountains. But the stairs are up near eastnortheast, but the agent's goal is to push boulders, not use stairs. 

Wait, looking at the map again, the agent's current position is at x=37, y=14. The map rows for y=13 and y=14 show #`.@.#.### and #`.@#.###, which might indicate that moving west from here goes into more walls (the ### part). So perhaps the agent is in a corridor with walls to the west beyond x=37. 

In that case, moving west further might not be effective. The boulder is to the north and northwest, so maybe the agent should try to move north into the boulder and push it, but as before, the north direction is blocked by a wall. 

Alternatively, the agent could move south to y=15 and see if there's a path. But looking at the map, y=15 is also ##########, which are walls. 

This is tricky. Maybe the agent needs to try a different approach. Since the last move west didn't work, perhaps moving east to (38,14) to see if there's a different path. The stairs are up near eastnortheast, so moving east might lead to the stairs, but the goal is to push boulders. 

Alternatively, check if there's another boulder somewhere else. The observation mentions ""boulder very near west,"" which could be at (36,14). If the agent moves west to (36,14), they could be next to that boulder and try to push it. 

But the agent's current position is (37,14), and moving west again would take them to (36,14). Let's see what's there. The map at x=36, y=14 shows a '<' which might be the agent's previous position. Wait, the map for y=14 is #.``...<##. So at x=36, y=14, there's a '<' indicating the agent was there previously. Now the agent is at x=37, y=14. 

If the agent moves west to (36,14), they would be next to the '<' position, which was previously occupied. Maybe that's a space they can move into. Once there, they could try to push the boulder at (36,13) north to (36,12), but again, checking the map, y=12 is a wall. 

Alternatively, maybe pushing the boulder to the southwest. If the boulder is at (36,13), pushing it southwest would take it to (35,12), but again, need to check if that's a passable space. 

This seems complicated. Maybe the best move is to try pushing the boulder in a direction where there's space. Since the agent can't push north or west due to walls, perhaps moving south to y=15 and then pushing the boulder south. But y=15 is a wall. 

Alternatively, the agent could move east to (38,14) and see if there's a path. From the current position, moving east would take them to x=38, y=14. The map for y=14 at x=38 is a '#', which is a wall. So that's not possible. 

Wait, the map for y=14 is: #.``...<##. So at x=38, y=14, it's a '#', meaning a wall. So moving east isn't possible. 

The agent is stuck between walls to the east and west beyond their current position. The only possible movement might be north, south, or around the boulders. 

Since pushing north is blocked, maybe the agent should try to move around the boulder to the east or west. But east is a wall, and west leads back to the previous position. 

Alternatively, use the yumi to shoot arrows at obstacles, but that might not help in pushing boulders. The goal is to push, not attack. 

Wait, the inventory has 26 ya arrows. If there's a way to destroy a wall to create a path, that could help. For example, shooting an arrow at a bar (which is probably a destructible wall) to clear a path. 

Looking at the language observation, there are bars very near northeast, east, eastsoutheast, etc. The agent is at (37,14). The bars to the northeast might be at (38,13) or similar. If the agent shoots an arrow there, it could destroy the bar, creating a passage. 

But the agent's goal is to push boulders, not destroy walls. However, if a wall is blocking the path to a fountain, removing it could allow placing the boulder there. 

Alternatively, focus on pushing the boulder towards the fountain in the southwest. To do that, the agent needs to maneuver the boulder into that direction. 

Given the current observations and map layout, the best immediate action might be to try pushing the boulder in a direction where there's space. Since pushing north and west are blocked, maybe pushing south or east. 

But the agent can't move east due to the wall. Pushing south into the boulder might work if there's space south of it. The boulder is at (37,13), so pushing south to (37,14) would be where the agent is standing, which isn't possible. 

Alternatively, pushing the boulder to the east. If the boulder is at (37,13), pushing it east to (38,13). Is there space there? The map at x=38, y=13 is a '.' (floor) based on the map row for y=13: #`.{.#.###. So x=38, y=13 is a '.', which is passable. So pushing the boulder east from (37,13) to (38,13) would be possible if the agent moves east into the boulder. 

Wait, the agent is at (37,14). The boulder is adjacent north (37,13) and northwest (36,13). To push the boulder east, the agent would need to move east into it, which would require the agent to be at (37,13) and move east, but the agent is currently at (37,14). 

Alternatively, the agent could move north to (37,13) and then push the boulder east. But moving north is blocked by the boulder. 

This is getting confusing. Let me summarize:

- Agent is at (37,14).
- Boulders are at (37,13) (north) and (36,13) (northwest).
- Fountain is at southwest.
- Walls block north and east movements beyond current position.
- Need to push a boulder onto a fountain.

Possible steps:

1. Move north to (37,13) to be adjacent to the boulder, then try to push east to (38,13). Check if (38,13) is a free space.
2. From (37,14), move north to (37,13), then east to (38,13), pushing the boulder.
3. If successful, the boulder would be at (38,13), which might be near a fountain if there's one in that area.

Looking at the map, at y=13, x=38 is part of the ########. So (38,13) is a wall. That can't be. So pushing east into a wall isn't possible. 

Alternative plan: Move west to (36,14), then try to push the boulder at (36,13) north to (36,12), but (36,12) is likely a wall. 

Alternatively, push the boulder south. The boulder at (37,13) can be pushed south to (37,14), which is where the agent is. That's not useful. 

Hmm. Maybe the agent should look for another boulder. The observation mentions ""boulder very near west,"" which could be at (36,14). If the agent moves west to (36,14), they can try to interact with that boulder. 

From (37,14), moving west to (36,14). Then, if there's a boulder at (36,14), the agent can try to push it north to (36,13), but that's where the other boulder is. Or push it south to (36,15), but again, check the map. 

The map for y=15 is ##########, so (36,15) is a wall. 

This is really challenging. Given the current observations and the need to avoid repeating the same actions, the best bet might be to try a different direction. The agent has been moving west multiple times, but that might not be the way. 

Looking at the message when trying to push the boulder earlier: ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" That indicates that there's something blocking the boulder's path. The agent needs to ensure that there's nothing behind the boulder in the direction they're pushing. 

If the agent moves south to (37,15), which is a wall, that's not possible. Moving north is blocked by the boulder. Moving east is a wall. Moving west to (36,14), then maybe pushing the boulder there. 

Alternatively, use the yumi to shoot an arrow at a bar to clear a path. For example, shooting a bar to the northeast (at (38,13)) to destroy it, creating a passage. Then the agent could move east into that space. 

The inventory has 26 arrows, so shooting is feasible. The agent's position is (37,14). The bars very near northeast would be at (38,13) or similar. 

If the agent shoots an arrow northeast, targeting the bar at (38,13), it might destroy the bar, allowing movement east. Once there, the agent could then push the boulder. 

This seems like a viable strategy. Using the yumi to break a wall and create a new path. 

So the chosen action would be to use the yumi (bow) to shoot an arrow in the northeast direction. The action for shooting would be ' shooting northeast' or a similar direction. 

But the available actions are only north, east, south, west. Wait, no—the initial problem statement lists the possible actions as north, east, south, west. But in Boxoban-like games, sometimes more actions are possible, like pushing, but according to the user's initial message, the possible actions are only the four directions. 

Wait, the user specified: ""You are an agent playing MiniHack. The following are the possible actions you can take in the game, followed by a short description of each action: north: move north, east: move east, south: move south, west: move west."" So the only allowed actions are the four directions. 

That changes things. The agent can only move in the four cardinal directions. They can't pick up items, shoot arrows, or push boulders—those actions are not in the allowed list. 

Wait, but the problem statement says the agent is playing Boxoban, which involves pushing boulders. However, according to the actions listed, the only possible actions are moving in the four directions. This is a contradiction. 

But the user might have simplified the actions for this particular task. So the agent can only move north, east, south, or west. Pushing boulders would have to be done by moving into them, which is allowed as a move action. For example, if the agent is adjacent to a boulder and moves in the direction of the boulder, they can push it if there's space behind. 

But in the previous observation, when the agent tried to move west, the boulder didn't move, likely because there was an obstacle behind it. 

Given that the only possible actions are the four directions, the agent must move in a way that allows pushing boulders by moving into them. 

So the agent's current problem is that they're next to a boulder but can't push it because the path is blocked. The solution is to move around to a position where pushing is possible. 

Given the agent's position (37,14) with a boulder to the north (37,13), the agent needs to move in a direction that allows pushing the boulder. For example, moving north to (37,13) and then moving east, south, or west if possible. 

But the agent can't move north because they're already next to the boulder, and moving north would take them into the boulder, which requires that the space behind the boulder (e.g., (37,12)) is free. Since (37,12) is a wall, pushing north isn't possible. 

Moving south from (37,14) to (","

",-0.001,False
9,west,"<reasoning>
Let's try to figure out what the agent should do here. The agent is in a Boxoban-like environment, trying to push boulders onto fountains. From the observations, the agent has already moved west multiple times, ending up at position (37,14). The latest message says ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain,"" which probably means the agent tried to push a boulder but it couldn't because it's blocked or there's no boulder in that direction.

Looking at the map, the cursor is at (37,14), and the agent's character is @. The map shows some bars (obstacles) and fountains. The nearest boulder is adjacent to the northwest and north. The agent's current position is next to a boulder to the northwest and north. The message about failing to move the boulder suggests that the agent might have tried pushing it north or northwest but couldn't because something is blocking it.

The agent's previous actions were moving west repeatedly, then south, north, south again, and then west once more. Now, after trying to push a boulder (which failed), the agent needs to figure out the next step. 

Since the boulders are adjacent to the north and northwest, maybe the agent needs to navigate around them to push them towards the fountains. The fountains are nearby in the northwest and southwest. The stairs up are eastnortheast, so maybe the goal isn't to use them yet. 

The agent's position is (37,14). If there's a boulder to the north (at (37,13)), the agent could try pushing it south towards the fountain. But the message says the last attempt failed, so perhaps there's an obstacle behind the boulder. Alternatively, the agent might need to move in a different direction to get a better angle to push the boulder.

Looking at the map again, at (37,14), the agent is next to a boulder to the north and northwest. The fountain is very near northwest, so maybe the boulder to the northwest needs to be pushed towards that fountain. To do that, the agent could move west to get next to that boulder and then push it south or southeast. However, the agent is already at (37,14), west of where they were before. 

Wait, the agent's current position is (37,14), and the boulder is adjacent northwest. That would be at (36,14) or (37,15)? Depending on the map's coordinate system. Assuming standard grid coordinates where moving north decreases the y-coordinate, then northwest from (37,14) would be (36,13). But the boulder is adjacent north and northwest, so maybe at (37,13) and (36,14). 

If the agent is at (37,14), moving north to (37,13) would be where the boulder is. But the message says the last attempt to push failed. Maybe the boulder is blocked by another obstacle. The bars are very near northeast, east, etc., but near the agent's current position, there might be bars blocking the path behind the boulder. 

Alternatively, the agent could try to move around the boulder. Since the boulder is to the north and northwest, moving west from (37,14) to (36,14) might allow the agent to get behind the boulder to the northwest (at (36,14)) and push it south towards the fountain. 

But the agent already tried moving west multiple times. Let's check the observations. After moving west to (38,13), then (37,13), then (36,13), then (38,13 again), etc. The latest move was west to (37,14). Now, the boulders are adjacent north and northwest. 

If the agent is at (37,14), moving northwest would take them to (36,13), which is where the boulder is. Then, trying to push it south into the fountain at (36,14) or something. But the fountain is at westsouthwest, which is maybe to the southwest. Wait, the fountain very near northwest is probably at (38,13) or similar. 

This is a bit confusing. The key point is that the agent needs to push the boulder onto the fountain. The latest failed attempt was probably pushing the boulder north or northwest, but it's blocked. The agent should instead position themselves to push the boulder in the correct direction. 

Looking at the current position (37,14), if there's a boulder to the northwest (say at (36,14)), then moving west to (36,14) and then pushing south into the fountain. Alternatively, if the boulder is at (37,13), moving north to (37,13) and pushing south. But the message said the last attempt failed, so maybe the boulder is blocked. 

Another possibility is that the agent needs to rearrange their position to get a clear path. For example, moving east to create space, but that might not help. Alternatively, moving south to get a different angle. 

Given that the agent is at (37,14) and the boulders are adjacent north and northwest, perhaps moving west to (36,14) and then pushing the boulder at (36,14) south into the fountain at (36,13). But the fountain is at westsouthwest, which might be further west. 

Alternatively, the agent could move south to (37,15) and then try to push the boulder from there. But the map shows bars adjacent southeast and south, so moving south might be blocked by bars. 

Considering all this, the best next action might be to move west to get next to the boulder to the northwest and then push it south towards the fountain. However, since the last attempt to push failed, maybe the agent needs to check their position again. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent should push the boulder to the north (at (37,13)) southward into the fountain. But if that's blocked, then the agent needs to find another way. 

Since the agent's last action was west to (37,14), and the boulder is adjacent northwest, moving northwest to (36,13) and then pushing the boulder south. That could work. 

But the available actions are north, east, south, west. So the agent can choose to move in any of those directions. Given the need to push the boulder, the agent should move into a position where they can push it. 

So, from (37,14), moving west to (36,14) would place them next to the boulder at (36,14) (if that's the northwest direction). Then, pushing south. But since the agent can't issue a push action directly, they have to move into the boulder's space, which would push it if there's space behind. 

Therefore, the agent should move west to (36,14) and then try to push the boulder south. But the immediate next action is to choose between north, east, south, west. 

Given that the boulder is to the northwest, moving west again would get the agent next to it. So the next action should be west again to position themselves to push the boulder south. However, the agent already moved west multiple times, and the tip says to avoid repeating actions. But in this case, it's necessary to reposition. 

Alternatively, maybe moving north to (37,13) where another boulder is adjacent, but the last attempt there failed. Perhaps there's an obstacle behind that boulder. 

Given the uncertainty, the best immediate action is to move west to get next to the boulder and attempt to push it south. So the chosen action is west.

Let me try to figure out what the agent should do next. The agent is in a Boxoban-like environment, and the goal is to push boulders onto fountains. Let's look at the current observation.

The agent's current position is (36, 14). The map shows there are several boulders and fountains around. The last action the agent took was moving west to (36,14), and when they tried to push a boulder, it didn't work. Now, looking at the language observation, there's a boulder very near northnortheast, and another adjacent to north, northeast, and west. The fountains are adjacent to east and south.

The agent needs to navigate to the boulder and push it towards a fountain. The immediate boulders around the agent are to the north and northwest. Since the agent is at (36,14), moving north would take them to (36,13), but there's a boulder adjacent there. To push the boulder north, the agent would need to move into it, but the boulder is blocked by something behind it. The message mentioned that pushing the boulder failed before, so maybe there's an obstacle behind it.

Looking at the map, there's a `#` character which represents a wall or obstacle. The agent's current position is at `@` on the map line: `#` `@` `{.` `#` `.` `#` `.` `#` `###`... So the agent is next to a `{` which might be a crate or another obstacle. Moving north from (36,14) would take the agent into the `{`, which is probably not passable. Therefore, pushing the northern boulder isn't possible right now because the path behind it is blocked.

The other boulder adjacent is to the west, but the agent is already moving west and can't go further west without hitting a wall (denoted by `#` on the map). So maybe the agent should try to move south or east to find a better position to push the boulder.

Looking at the fountains, there's one adjacent to the east and south. If the agent can get the boulder to the east or south, that would solve the level. Let's see the bars and dark areas. The east direction might have less obstacles. The agent's last move was west, and they are now at (36,14). Moving south to (36,15) could be an option. Let's check the map there. The line for y=15 is `#` `.` `@` `<` `##`... So moving south would take the agent into `@` but that's their current position. Wait, maybe the map's y-coordinate increases downward. Let me confirm the map layout.

In NetHack, the map typically has the top line as y=1 and the bottom as higher. So in the given map, the agent is at y=14. The line for y=14 is `#` `.``...<##`... So moving south from (36,14) would go to y=15, which is `#` `.` `@` `<` `##`... Wait, no, the agent's current position is at (36,14), which is in the line `#` `.``...<##`... So the '@' is at position 36,14. Moving south would take them to y=15, which in the map is `#` `.` `{@#`.###`... So the agent would move into the `{@#` part. That might be a wall or another obstacle.

Alternatively, moving east from (36,14) to (37,14) might be possible. The current position's east is a `<` in the map line: `#` `.``...<##`... So the `<` is at (37,14), which might be a door or another interactive element. But moving east into `<` could be a way to proceed. However, the agent needs to reach a boulder to push.

Another approach: the boulder adjacent to the northwest (position 35,14). The agent is at (36,14). To reach the northwest boulder, they need to move west to (35,14), but that's blocked by a `#` in the map. Wait, the agent's current position is at (36,14), and the map line shows `#` `.``...<##`... So between the agent and the northwest boulder (which is at 35,14), there's a `.` which is passable ground. Wait, no, the agent is at (36,14), and the boulder is adjacent to the northwest. So maybe the boulder is at (35,14), and the agent can move west to (35,14) to interact with it. But the map shows a `.` at (35,14) in that line. Let me check again.

The map line for y=14 is: `#` `.``...<##`... So positions 34,14 is `#`, 35,14 is `.`, 36,14 is `@`, 37,14 is ```, etc. Wait, maybe the formatting is off. Let me parse the map correctly. Each line represents a row in the game. Assuming that each `#` is a wall, `.` is floor, `@` is the agent, `<` is maybe a door, `{` is a crate, etc.

Looking at the map for y=14: the line is `#` `.``...<##`... So breaking it down:

- Position 34,14: `#` (wall)
- 35,14: `.` (floor)
- 36,14: `@` (agent)
- 37,14: ``` (unknown, maybe floor)
- 38,14: `<` (door or something)
- Then `##` etc.

So the agent is at (36,14). The boulder adjacent to the west would be at (35,14), but that's a `.` on the map. Wait, maybe the boulder is represented by another character, like `o` for boulder. But in the current map, I don't see any `o` in the vicinity. The language observation mentions a boulder adjacent west, so perhaps it's at (35,14), but the map shows a `.` there. That might be a discrepancy. Maybe the map uses different symbols for boulders when they are pushable or not. Alternatively, the boulder could be behind an obstacle.

Alternatively, the boulder might be at (37,14), but the map shows a `<` there. Hmm. This is a bit confusing. Let me refer back to the language observations.

The language observation says: ""boulder adjacent north, northeast, and west"". So the agent at (36,14) has boulders adjacent to north (35,13?), northeast (37,13?), and west (35,14). But on the map, those positions don't show a boulder symbol. Maybe the boulders are behind walls or not yet visible.

The agent tried to push a boulder before and failed, which probably means there's an obstacle behind it. So the best move now is to navigate around to find a way to push the boulder. Maybe moving east to get a better angle, or south to avoid the walls.

Another thought: the stairs up are near eastnortheast. The agent's goal is to push boulders to fountains, not necessarily use the stairs. So focusing on that.

Looking at the fountains adjacent to east and south. If the agent can push a boulder to the east or south, that would solve the level. The agent is currently at (36,14). Moving south to (36,15) might be possible. Let's check the map for y=15: it's `#` `.` `{@#`.###`... So at (36,15), there's a `{@#` which might be a crate and the agent. Wait, the agent's position is at (36,14), and moving south to y=15 would place them at (36,15), which is the `@` in the y=15 line. Wait, no, the y=15 line is `#` `.` `{@#`.###`..., so position (36,15) is the `{`? That can't be right. Maybe I'm misreading the map.

Alternatively, perhaps the map's lines are structured with each character representing a cell. Let's assume each line corresponds to a y-coordinate, starting from the top. So the first line is the highest y (top of the map), and the last line is the lowest y (bottom). The agent's position is at (36,14), which is in the line corresponding to y=14. That line is: `#` `.``...<##`... So the agent is at the 6th character (0-indexed) of that line, which is `@`.

To move south, the agent would go to y=15, which is the next line down: `#` `.` `{@#`.###`... So at y=15, x=36 is `{`, which is a crate. The agent can't move into a crate, so moving south directly is blocked.

Moving east from (36,14) to (37,14) would take them to the `<` character. In NetHack, `<` usually represents a door that can be opened. So the agent could try to open the door by moving into it, which might allow passage eastward. Once the door is opened, the agent could proceed east to potentially find a boulder or a path.

Alternatively, moving north from (36,14) to (36,13) would take the agent into the `{` character, which is another crate. That's also blocked.

So the possible moves are:

- East to (37,14) towards the `<` door.
- South is blocked by a crate.
- North is blocked by a crate.
- West is towards (35,14), which is a `.` on the map, but according to the language observation, there's a boulder adjacent west. This might mean the boulder is behind the agent's current position, perhaps at (35,14) but blocked by a wall. So pushing west isn't possible.

Given that, the best option is to move east to the door `<` and attempt to open it. Once the door is open, the agent can proceed east to find a boulder or a path to push a boulder towards a fountain.

Another possibility is that the boulder is north of the agent, at (36,13). The agent is at (36,14), so moving north to (36,13) would be into the `{` crate, which is blocked. Therefore, the boulder must be somewhere else.

Alternatively, the boulder adjacent to the northwest (35,14) but the map shows a `.` there. This discrepancy suggests that maybe the boulder is represented by a different symbol or is obstructed by a wall. Since the agent can't push the boulder north, perhaps they need to reposition.

In summary, the agent should try to move east to the door `<` and open it to explore further. This could provide a path to maneuver the boulder towards the adjacent fountain to the east.

",-0.001,False
11,north,"<reasoning>
Let's see where I am. The agent is trying to push boulders onto fountains in this Boxoban-like game. The problem here is that the boulder is adjacent to the agent (west), but previous attempts to move west resulted in a message saying ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" That probably means there's something blocking the boulder.

Looking at the map, the agent's position is (x=37, y=14). The boulder is adjacent west, which would be at (36,14). The map shows that moving west from here might hit a wall or another obstacle. The latest observation shows that the boulder is adjacent north and northwest, so maybe there's a barrier behind it preventing it from being pushed further west.

The agent needs to find a way to position itself so that it can push the boulder north or northwest towards the fountain. The cursor is at (37,14), and the fountain is very near northwest. So maybe moving north or northwest first could create space to push the boulder west into the fountain.

The last action was west, which didn't work. Now the agent is back at (37,14). The next step could be to try pushing the boulder again, but first, check if there's a way to move around. Since moving west again is blocked, perhaps moving north towards the boulder's current position (northwest) might allow a push. Alternatively, moving northwest directly could help.

Looking at the map, the agent's current position is marked with @, and the boulder is adjacent west. The bars and dark areas suggest walls or obstacles. To push the boulder, the agent needs to be next to it with nothing blocking its path behind. Since the boulder is adjacent northwest, maybe moving northwest would position the agent to push it towards the fountain.

Another option is to check if there's a clear path to the boulder's northwest direction. The fountain is very near northwest, so if the boulder can be moved there, that's the goal. The agent's current position is (37,14), so northwest would be (36,13). If moving there is possible, then pushing the boulder from (37,14) west to (36,14) into the fountain at (36,13) would work. But the previous attempt to move west didn't work, indicating something is blocking the boulder's path.

Wait, the message says ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" That means there's an obstacle behind the boulder where it's trying to go. So to push the boulder, the agent needs to first remove the obstacle. But since the agent can't interact with other objects except pushing boulders, maybe there's a way to rearrange the boulders by pushing them in other directions.

Alternatively, maybe the boulder is stuck against a wall or another boulder. The agent could try moving around to a different angle. For example, moving north to (37,13) and then trying to push the boulder from the northwest direction. That way, the agent would be behind the boulder relative to the fountain, allowing it to push towards the fountain.

So the steps might be: move north to (37,13), then move west to (36,13), which is the fountain's location. But need to check if that path is clear. Looking at the map, there's a bar adjacent southeast and south, so moving north might avoid those. Alternatively, moving northwest directly from (37,14) to (36,13) could be a better approach if that's a valid direction.

Another angle: the boulder is at (36,14) adjacent west to the agent. To push it northwest into the fountain at (36,13), the agent needs to be at (37,14) and push the boulder northwest. But the message says that moving west didn't work, so perhaps the boulder is blocked by something to the west of (36,14). Maybe a wall or another boulder. So the agent needs to first clear that path.

Alternatively, the agent could push the boulder north first. If the boulder is at (36,14), pushing it north to (36,13) towards the fountain. But again, if there's an obstacle there, that won't work. The fountain is at (36,13) very near northwest, so maybe that's the target.

In summary, the agent should try to push the boulder either north or northwest towards the fountain. Since moving west directly didn't work, perhaps moving north first to get a better angle. Let's try moving north to (37,13) and then attempt to push the boulder northwest.

Let's see where I am. The agent is trying to move a boulder but keeps failing. The last action was moving north, which resulted in the same message. The boulder is adjacent to the agent's current position (north and northwest). The agent's position is (37,14).

The agent needs to push the boulder. To push a boulder, the agent must move into it, and there must be no obstacle behind the boulder's new position. Looking at the map, the boulder is to the north. If the agent moves north again, they might be trying to walk into the boulder, but since pushing requires the space behind to be clear, maybe there's something blocking the boulder's path. Wait, the message says ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain,"" which means the agent is either not next to it or there's an obstacle behind. 

Looking at the language observation, the boulder adjacent north and northwest. So the agent is at (37,14), north would be (37,13). The boulder is there. To push it south, the agent needs to move north (into the boulder) and ensure that the space south of the boulder (37,12) is clear. The problem might be that the space behind the boulder is blocked. Let me check the map again. The map shows some bars and fountains around, but the exact position of the space behind the boulder isn't clear. If that space is blocked, the agent can't push the boulder. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent is not positioned correctly. If the boulder is to the northwest, perhaps moving northwest would allow pushing it west or south. But the agent tried moving north multiple times. Maybe trying a different direction. Let's check the cursor position again. The agent is at (37,14). The boulder is adjacent north (37,13). The agent is trying to move north into the boulder but failing. That suggests that the space behind the boulder (37,12) is blocked. So the agent can't push the boulder south because that space is occupied. 

In that case, the agent needs to find a way to create space behind the boulder. Maybe move around to a different side where the boulder can be pushed without obstruction. Alternatively, check if there's another boulder nearby that's blocking. But in the current observations, the boulder is only adjacent north and northwest. 

Another possibility is that the agent is not adjacent properly. Maybe needs to get closer. But since the boulder is adjacent north, the agent is already next to it. So the issue must be the space behind. 

Wait, the map shows some characters like `#` which might be walls or obstacles. Looking at the map layout, the agent is in a corridor with walls (##########) around. The exact position of the boulder and the space behind needs to be inferred. If pushing the boulder south is blocked by a wall or another obstacle, the agent can't do it. 

Given that the agent can't push the boulder north, maybe try pushing it west (northwest direction). But the agent is already trying to move north. Alternatively, check if moving west from the current position allows accessing the boulder from another side. But the agent's last move was north, and they are at (37,14). If they move west again to (36,14), maybe they can then push the boulder northwest. 

Alternatively, the agent could try to move in a direction that allows the boulder to be pushed into a fountain. The goal is to push boulders onto fountains. Looking at the language observation, there's a fountain very near northwest. So maybe the boulder needs to be moved west-northwest towards that fountain. 

But to do that, the agent might need to position themselves so that pushing the boulder west or north will get it onto the fountain. Let's think: the agent is at (37,14). The boulder is at (37,13) (north) and (36,13) (northwest?). If the agent moves west to (36,14), then they can face the boulder at (36,13) (northwest of agent's new position). Then, pushing the boulder west would take it to (35,13), which might be towards the fountain. 

So the plan could be: move west to get next to the boulder on the northwest side, then push it west. But before that, the agent needs to free up the path. However, the agent is currently trying to push the boulder north but failing because the space behind is blocked. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent should check the surroundings for obstacles. The bars and dark areas might indicate walls or other blocks. The map shows a lot of ##### and ##########, which are probably walls. So pushing the boulder into a direction where there's a wall would be impossible. 

Given the current state, the best action might be to try pushing the boulder in a different direction, like northwest, if possible. But the agent is already adjacent north. Wait, the boulder is adjacent north and northwest. So the agent is at (37,14), boulder is at (37,13) (north) and (36,13) (northwest). To push the boulder northwest, the agent would need to move northwest into the boulder's space, which would require the space northwest of the boulder (35,12) to be clear. 

If that space is clear, pushing the boulder northwest would place it on the fountain (which is very near northwest). So the agent could try moving northwest to push it there. However, the agent's current position is (37,14). Moving northwest would take them to (36,13), which is where the boulder is. Wait, no. The boulder is at (37,13) (north) and (36,13) (northwest of agent's current position). So if the agent is at (37,14), moving northwest would take them to (36,13), which is the position of the boulder. So to push the boulder northwest, the agent needs to move into the boulder's current position (northwest direction), which would require that the space behind the boulder (35,12) is clear. 

If that space is clear, then pushing the boulder northwest would work. The agent needs to check if that's the case. From the language observation, there's a fountain very near northwest, which suggests that the path might be clear towards there. 

But the agent's previous attempts to push the boulder north failed because the space behind was blocked. So maybe pushing it northwest is the way to go. Therefore, the next action should be to move northwest to push the boulder into the fountain.

Let's take a look at the situation. The agent is in a Boxoban-like environment, needing to push boulders onto fountains. The previous attempts involved moving west multiple times, but the last action was northwest, which resulted in the message ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" So, the agent is trying to interact with a boulder but failing.

First, I need to analyze the current position and surroundings. The cursor is at (37,14). The map shows various bars, dark areas, and a boulder adjacent to the agent's current position. The message indicates that when the agent tried to move the boulder, it didn't budge. This suggests that either the boulder is stuck due to obstacles behind it or perhaps the agent is not positioned correctly to push it.

Looking at the map, there's a boulder adjacent to the northwest. The agent tried moving northwest, which might have been an attempt to approach the boulder from the side or behind. But since the boulder wasn't moved, maybe the agent is not behind it or there's another obstacle blocking the path. The bars and dark areas around might be walls or other obstacles that prevent the boulder from being pushed further.

The agent's inventory includes a katana and a yumi (bow), but since the task is to push boulders, using the bow might not be necessary. The splint mail and weapons are defensive or offensive but not directly relevant here. The key is to find a way to push the boulder onto the fountain.

Possible next steps: Check if there's a clear path behind the boulder. If the agent moves to the position right behind the boulder, they can push it. However, the current attempts to move west or northwest might not have positioned the agent correctly. Alternatively, maybe the boulder is stuck against another obstacle or another boulder.

The agent needs to navigate to a position where they can push the boulder in the direction of a fountain. Looking at the language observation, there's a fountain very near northwest. So the target is to the northwest. If the boulder is adjacent to the agent's current position, perhaps moving north or west again could allow pushing it towards the fountain.

Wait, the previous action was northwest, which didn't work. Maybe the agent needs to move closer to the boulder. Let's see the map again. The agent's position is (37,14) with a boulder adjacent north and northwest. So the boulder is to the north and northwest of the agent. If the agent moves north, they might be able to push the boulder west into the fountain.

Alternatively, moving west and then north could position the agent to push the boulder. Let's check the map layout. The agent is at (37,14). The boulder is adjacent north, so moving north to (37,13) would place them next to the boulder. Then, pushing north from there would move the boulder into the fountain located northwest. But the current map shows that moving north from (37,14) would take the agent into a position where the boulder is already adjacent. Wait, the message says the boulder is adjacent north, so the boulder is at (37,13). If the agent is at (37,14) and moves north to (37,13), they would be next to the boulder. Then, pushing north from there would attempt to move the boulder to (37,12), but need to check if that's a valid position (not blocked by bars or walls).

However, the language observation mentions that there are bars very near northeast, east, etc., which might block the path. The agent needs to ensure that pushing the boulder north would not result in it getting stuck against another obstacle. Given the current setup, perhaps the correct action is to move north to get behind the boulder and then push it north towards the fountain.

Alternatively, if moving northwest again but from a different position could help. But since the previous attempt failed, maybe the agent needs to reposition. Another possibility is that there's another boulder or obstacle blocking the path to the fountain. The agent should check the surrounding areas for clear paths.

In summary, the best course is to move north to get next to the boulder and then push it north towards the fountain. However, if that's blocked, the agent might need to find another route. Given the information, moving north seems like the next logical step to try pushing the boulder.

",-0.001,False
14,west,"<reasoning>
Let's try to figure out what to do here. The agent is stuck trying to push a boulder, but it's not working. Let me look at the observations again.

The current position is (37, 14). The message says ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" So the boulder must be somewhere nearby that's blocking the path. The language observations mention boulders very near north and west. The map shows the agent's position with `<` indicating direction, but the exact map details are a bit unclear with all those `#` and `.`. 

The agent has already tried moving west multiple times but ended up back at the same spot after failing to push the boulder. Moving north also didn't help. The stairs are up to the eastnortheast, but the goal here seems to be pushing the boulder onto the fountain. The closest fountain is reported to be very near northwest. 

Maybe the agent needs to reposition to get a better angle to push the boulder. Since the boulder is adjacent to the agent's current position (north and northwest), perhaps moving diagonally or finding an open space to push it towards the fountain. However, the obstacles like bars and dark areas are complicating the movement. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to check if there's a way to move around the boulder. Since moving west repeatedly didn't work, maybe trying another direction like south or east could create a path. But the observations show bars and dark areas in those directions. 

Wait, the stairs are to the eastnortheast. Should the agent head there instead? But the primary goal is pushing the boulder, not going up stairs. The fountain is northwest, so maybe moving northwest direction could lead to a better position. 

The agent tried northwest but the system defaulted to north. Maybe the correct direction is north again, but that's where the boulder is. Alternatively, perhaps using a different weapon or skill, but the inventory shows basic weapons. 

Hmm, maybe the agent needs to backtrack. Moving east back to x=38, y=14 might allow a different approach. From there, trying to move north or west again. Alternatively, checking if the boulder can be pushed when there's space behind it. 

The problem is the boulder is stuck, so the agent might need to find a way to clear the path behind it. Since the boulder is adjacent north and northwest, moving the agent to a position where they can push it south or east could work. But the current surroundings are mostly barriers. 

Another thought: the agent's inventory has a yumi (bow) and ya (arrows). Maybe using the bow to shoot the boulder loose? But the agent is a samurai, and in NetHack, using ranged weapons requires aiming, which might not be the best approach here. Plus, the boulder is probably too heavy to be affected by arrows. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to pick up the boulder, but in Sokoban-like games, you can't pick up boulders; you can only push them. So the agent must find an open space behind the boulder to push it towards the fountain. 

Looking at the map, the agent is surrounded by bars and dark areas. The only open paths might be towards the east or south, but those are either blocked or lead back. The fountain is northwest, so maybe the agent needs to move northwest around the boulder. But the previous attempt to go northwest resulted in the same spot. 

Wait, the agent's current position is x=37, y=14. The boulder is adjacent north (y=13) and northwest (x=36, y=13). To push the boulder northwest, the agent would need to move northwest, but if there's a barrier, that's not possible. Alternatively, moving north to y=13 and then trying to push the boulder west or northwest from there. 

But the agent already tried moving north and got the same message. Maybe the boulder is stuck against a wall or another obstacle. In that case, the agent needs to find a different pathway. 

Perhaps the agent should try moving east to x=38, y=14, then try pushing the boulder from there. If the boulder is at x=37, y=13, moving east to x=38, y=14 and then moving north to x=38, y=13 could allow pushing the boulder west into the fountain. 

Alternatively, moving south to y=15 might open up a path, but the observations don't indicate open areas there. 

Another angle: the agent's cursor is at (37,14), and the boulder is adjacent north and northwest. The fountain is very near northwest, so maybe pushing the boulder northwest into the fountain. To do that, the agent needs to be positioned to the southeast of the boulder. Current position is southeast of the boulder (which is at x=37, y=13). So if the agent moves north to y=13, they can push the boulder west into the fountain at (36,13). 

But when the agent tried moving north before, they got the same message. Maybe the boulder is against a wall. Let me check the map again. The map shows ""#"" which are walls, and ""."" as floors. The agent's position is at a floor with `<` indicating direction. The boulder is adjacent north and northwest, so likely on a floor tile. 

If the agent moves north to (37,13), which is where the boulder is, then tries to push it west into the fountain at (36,13), that might work. But the previous attempts to move north resulted in the same position, which suggests that moving north isn't changing the position, meaning there's a barrier. 

Wait, the cursor's position after moving north was still (37,14), which means the movement wasn't successful. So perhaps there's a wall blocking the path north. That would explain why the agent can't move north. 

In that case, the agent needs to find a way around the wall. Looking at the map, the area is filled with ##########, which are walls. The only open spaces are the dots and the agent's position. The bars are probably obstacles (like fences or other structures). 

Given all this, the best approach might be to try pushing the boulder from a different angle. Since moving north is blocked, perhaps moving west past the boulder first. But earlier attempts to move west didn't work because the boulder is blocking. 

Wait, the agent was at x=38, y=13 after moving west multiple times. Then, moving west again got them to x=37, y=13, but pushing the boulder there wasn't working. Maybe the boulder is stuck against another obstacle. 

Alternatively, the agent could try moving east to x=38, y=14, then south to y=13, positioning themselves to push the boulder west into the fountain. 

Let me outline the possible steps:

1. Move east to x=38, y=14.
2. Move south to x=38, y=13.
3. Push the boulder west (to x=37, y=13) into the fountain at (36,13).

But the agent needs to confirm the fountain's location. The observations say the fountain is very near northwest, which would be x=36, y=13 if the boulder is at x=37, y=13. 

Alternatively, maybe the fountain is at (38,12) or another coordinate. Without a clear map, it's tricky, but the goal is to get the boulder onto any fountain. 

Another possibility is that the agent needs to use the stairs up to the eastnortheast to go to a different level, but the immediate goal is pushing the boulder here. 

Given the limitations, the best action might be to continue trying to push the boulder in a direction that leads it towards the fountain. Since the agent is adjacent to the boulder on the north and northwest, perhaps moving northwest (diagonally) if possible. 

But the system didn't accept northwest earlier, defaulting to north. Maybe the correct direction is north again, but that's where the boulder is. 

Alternatively, the agent could try moving in a different direction entirely, like east, to see if there's an open path that allows circling around the boulder. 

In the last observation, after moving west to x=36, y=14, the agent's position is there. Maybe moving south from there to y=13 and then trying to push the boulder. 

Wait, the agent's current position after the last valid action was x=37, y=14. The boulder is adjacent north (y=13) and northwest (x=36, y=13). 

If the agent moves north to y=13 (position x=37, y=13), they can try pushing the boulder west into the fountain. But earlier attempts didn't work, so maybe the boulder is against a wall there. 

Alternatively, moving northwest from x=37, y=14 would take the agent to x=36, y=13, which is the boulder's position. But pushing from there might not be possible. 

This is getting a bit confusing. Maybe the agent needs to try a different approach, like using the bow to shoot the boulder, but that's unlikely to work. 

Given the information, the safest bet is to keep trying to push the boulder in the direction that leads it towards the fountain. Since the fountain is northwest, pushing the boulder west or northwest would be ideal. 

The agent's current position is southeast of the boulder. To push it west, they need to be to the east of the boulder. So moving west to get next to the boulder. Wait, the agent was at x=37, y=14, and the boulder is at x=37, y=13 (north) and x=36, y=13 (northwest). 

If the agent moves north to y=13 (x=37, y=13), they are next to the boulder. Then, pushing west would move it to x=36, y=13, which is the fountain's location. 

But the agent tried moving north before and got the message that they couldn't push the boulder. Maybe there's a wall behind the boulder, preventing it from moving further west. 

In that case, the agent would need to move the boulder in a different direction, like north or east, but those might be blocked. 

Alternatively, if the boulder can be pushed south into the fountain, but the fountain is northwest, so that's not helpful. 

Given all this, the most logical action is to keep trying to push the boulder west from the position adjacent to it. So, moving north to (37,13) and then pushing west. But since that didn't work before, maybe the agent needs to find another way. 

Perhaps the agent needs to move around the boulder to the west side. From x=37, y=14, moving west to x=36, y=14, then south to y=13, putting them west of the boulder at (37,13). Then, pushing the boulder north or west. 

This seems like a possible path. Let's outline the steps:

1. Move west from (37,14) to (36,14).
2. Move south from (36,14) to (36,13).
3. Now, the boulder is at (37,13), adjacent north to (36,13).
4. Push the boulder north to (37,12) or west to (35,13).

But the fountain is at (36,13), so pushing the boulder west from (36,13) would place it on the fountain. 

So the actions would be: west, south, then west (to push). 

However, the agent needs to execute these steps. Given that the previous attempts to move west were successful but didn't resolve the boulder issue, this might be the way to go. 

But the agent's current position is (37,14). Moving west to (36,14), then south to (36,13), then west to (35,13) to push the boulder. 

Alternatively, from (36,13), push the boulder north to (37,12), but that's away from the fountain. 

Given the fountain is at (36,13), pushing the boulder west from (36,13) to (35,13) would place it on the fountain. 

So the agent needs to get to (36,13) and push west. 

To get there:

1. Move west from (37,14) to (36,14).
2. Move south from (36,14) to (36,13).
3. Now, the boulder is at (37,13), adjacent north to (36,13).
4. Push the boulder north into (37,12) or west into (35,13).

But pushing west from (36,13) would require the agent to be adjacent to the boulder. Since the boulder is at (37,13), the agent is at (36,13), which is to the west of the boulder. So to push the boulder west, the agent needs to be to the east of it. 

Wait, no. The agent is at (36,13), and the boulder is at (37,13). The agent is west of the boulder. To push the boulder west, the agent needs to move west into the boulder's space, which is possible if there's space behind it. 

But the boulder's position is (37,13), and behind it (west) would be (36,13), which is where the agent is. So the agent is trying to push the boulder west into their own position, which isn't possible. 

Therefore, the agent needs to be to the east of the boulder to push it west. So from (37,13), the agent can push the boulder west to (36,13). 

But the agent is currently at (37,14). To get to (37,13), they need to move north. But earlier attempts to move north didn't work, possibly because there's a wall. 

Looking at the map, the agent's position is in a area with lots of walls (#). The only open spaces are the dots (.). The agent's position is on a dot, as is the boulder's location. 

If the agent can move north to (37,13), they can then push the boulder west. But why didn't that work before? Maybe there's a wall at (37,12), blocking the boulder's movement. 

In that case, the boulder can't move further west because it's against a wall. So the agent would have to move the boulder in another direction, like north or east. 

But the goal is to get it to the fountain, which is northwest. If the boulder can't move west due to a wall, maybe the agent needs to find a way to push it north into a different path. 

Alternatively, the fountain might be in a different location that the agent hasn't observed yet. 

Given the limited information and the fact that the agent keeps getting the ""boulder in vain"" message, the best immediate action is to continue trying to push the boulder in the direction that seems most logical, which is west towards the fountain. 

So, the next action should be to move north to (37,13) and then push west. But since moving north didn't work before, maybe the agent needs to try a different sequence. 

Alternatively, the agent could try moving in a different direction, like east, to see if there's an open path that allows approaching the boulder from another angle. 

Given the uncertainty, the safest bet is to keep trying to move towards the boulder and push it west. The previous attempts were somewhat successful in getting closer, so another push might work if the path is clear. 

Therefore, the chosen action is to move north to (37,13) and then push west. But since the system requires a single action, the agent should first move north if possible, then push west. 

However, the last observation shows that moving north didn't change the position, indicating a wall. Therefore, the agent should instead try moving west again to see if there's a different outcome. 

Wait, the agent's previous actions were west, west, west, south, north, south, west, etc. Maybe they need to try a different direction like southwest or southeast. 

But given the available actions are only north, south, east, west, the agent has to use those. 

Another idea: the boulder might be a different type that can't be pushed, but the observations say it's a boulder. 

In conclusion, the most logical next action is to continue moving towards the boulder to position oneself correctly for a successful push. Since moving north didn't work, trying to move west again or find a different approach. 

But given the agent is already west of the boulder's northern position, perhaps the correct action is to push west from there. However, the agent needs to be adjacent to the boulder. 

Given the confusion and the need to choose from the allowed actions, the best guess is to try pushing west again, possibly from a different position. 

So, the final action is west.

15,north,"<reasoning>
Let's see. The agent is trying to push a boulder onto a fountain in NetHack. The current position is (36, 14). The map shows some bars and dark areas, but the key elements are the boulders and fountains.

The latest observation says there's a boulder very near northnortheast and a fountain very near northnorthwest. The adjacent areas have boulders to the north and northwest. The agent just tried moving west again but hit a boulder. The message says ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain,"" which implies the last action was trying to push a boulder, which didn't work because there's something blocking it.

Looking at the map, the agent's current position is at (36,14) with the @ symbol. The map shows a ""#"" which might be a wall or obstacle. The nearby boulders are to the north and northwest. The fountain is to the northwest, so maybe the agent needs to position themselves to push the boulder towards the fountain.

Since the agent is stuck trying to move the boulder west again, perhaps they need to reposition. Moving north might allow them to get around the boulder blocking the west direction. Alternatively, checking if there's a clear path to the northwest to push the boulder towards the fountain.

The inventory shows the agent has a katana and yumi (bow), but pushing boulders usually requires being next to them and moving towards the target. The agent might need to go around the current boulder to the north and then push it west towards the fountain.

So, possible actions: move north to get closer to the boulder, then try pushing it west. Alternatively, check if moving northwest is possible. But given the previous attempts to move west resulted in blocking, moving north first could be a better approach to reposition.

Let's see. The agent is trying to solve Boxoban, which is like Sokoban. The goal is to push all the boulders onto the fountains. The previous actions were moving west multiple times, then north, south, etc. The last action was north, and the message said ""With great effort you move the boulder."" So that means the agent successfully pushed the boulder north.

Now, looking at the current observation: the boulder is adjacent to north, northeast, east, and southwest. The fountains are adjacent to southeast and northwest. The agent is at (36,13). The map shows some structures, but it's a bit unclear. The key is to figure out where the fountains are and which direction the boulder needs to go.

The boulder was pushed north, and the message indicates success. The next step is to check if the boulder is now on a fountain. Since the fountains are adjacent to southeast and northwest, but the boulder is now north, northeast, etc., maybe the next move is to push it further north towards a fountain. Alternatively, there might be another boulder that needs moving, but from the observations, it seems like the current boulder was the one being pushed.

The agent is at (36,13). The boulder is adjacent north, so if the agent moves north again, they might be able to push it further. But need to check if there's space behind the boulder. The message after pushing north said it succeeded, so there must be a clear path north from the boulder's new position. Therefore, moving north again to push the boulder towards a fountain would be the next logical step.

Alternatively, check the surrounding areas for other obstacles. The dark areas and bars might indicate walls or other obstacles. Since the agent successfully pushed north last time, repeating that action to push further north makes sense. The goal is to get the boulder onto a fountain, so if pushing north gets it closer to a fountain at northwest, that would be ideal.

So the best action here is to move north again to continue pushing the boulder towards the fountain.

Let me try to figure out what to do next. The goal is to push the boulder onto the fountain. Looking at the current observation, the agent is at position (36, 12). The boulder is very near southsouthwest, and there's a fountain to the west. The agent just moved the boulder north to (36,13) and now it's at (36,12). The message says that moving the boulder was successful.

So now, I need to check the map and surroundings. The cursor is at (36,12), and the boulder is adjacent to north, east, and southeast. The fountain is adjacent to the west. That means the boulder is next to the fountain on the west side. Wait, but the agent needs to push the boulder onto the fountain. If the boulder is adjacent to the fountain, maybe the agent can push it further west into the fountain.

Looking at the map, the agent is facing west (since the last action was north to get to (36,12)). The fountain is adjacent west, so perhaps the agent should try to push the boulder west into the fountain. But the current observation says the boulder is adjacent north, east, and southeast. Wait, after moving north from (36,13) to (36,12), the boulder would be where the agent was before, which was (36,13). But the message said the boulder was moved, so maybe the boulder is now at (36,12) as well? Or maybe the boulder is in a different position.

Wait, maybe the boulder was at (36,14) previously. The agent moved north from (36,14) to (36,13), and then pushed the boulder north to (36,12). So the boulder is now at (36,12), and the agent is also at (36,12). The fountain is adjacent west, which would be at (35,12). So the agent needs to push the boulder from (36,12) to (35,12), which is the fountain.

But the problem is that the agent is already at (36,12) where the boulder is. To push the boulder west, the agent needs to move into the boulder's direction. Since the boulder is adjacent west, the agent should move west into the boulder, which would push it further west into the fountain.

So the correct action here would be to move west. That should push the boulder west into the fountain, achieving the goal. Let me confirm the directions. The agent is at (36,12). Moving west would take them to (35,12), which is where the fountain is. Since the boulder is adjacent west (at (36,12) next to the agent's current position), moving west into the boulder's space would push it to (35,12), the fountain. That should solve the problem.

Another thing to check: are there any obstacles behind the boulder? The observation mentions that the agent can push the boulder if there's no obstacle behind. Looking at the language observation, there's no mention of obstacles behind the boulder. The bars and dark areas are in other directions. So it should be safe to push the boulder west.

Therefore, the best action is to move west to push the boulder into the fountain.

Let's see. The goal is to push the boulders onto the fountains. The latest observation shows that after moving north a few times, the boulder was moved once successfully. Now, the agent is at (36,13) and pushed the boulder north to (36,14). But then when trying to move further north, the message says ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" So maybe there's an obstacle blocking the boulder's path now.

Looking at the current observation: The agent is at (35,12) after moving west. The boulder is very near east, eastsoutheast, and south. The fountains are near southsoutheast and southeast. The bars near north and northeast might be walls or obstacles. The agent needs to position the boulder next to a fountain.

Since the boulder is to the east, maybe pushing it towards the southeast fountain would work. But the agent is now at (35,12), west of where the boulder is. To reach the boulder, the agent should move east. But when the agent tried moving north previously, the boulder couldn't be moved. Maybe the boulder is stuck against a wall or another obstacle.

Wait, in the map, the agent's current position is marked with '@' at (35,12). The boulder is very near east (so perhaps at (36,12)), eastsoutheast (37,13), and south (35,13). The fountains are near southsoutheast (maybe at 37,14) and southeast (36,13). 

To push the boulder onto the fountain at southeast (36,13), the agent needs to be adjacent to the boulder and push it south. But the agent is at (35,12). If the boulder is at (36,12), the agent can move east to (36,12), then push south to (36,13), which is a fountain. That would solve the problem. However, the previous attempts to move north and other directions might have the boulder blocked. 

Wait, the latest message after pushing north was success, moving the boulder to (36,13). Now, the agent is at (36,12) after moving west. The boulder is now at (36,13). The fountain is at southeast, which might be (37,13) or (36,13). Need to check the map. The fountain very near southeast could be (37,13). So the boulder is at (36,13), which is adjacent to the southeast fountain. If the agent can push the boulder east to (37,13), that would be onto the fountain. 

But the agent is at (36,12). To reach the boulder at (36,13), the agent needs to move south to (36,13). Then, from there, push east to (37,13). However, the agent's current position is (35,12) after moving west. Wait, maybe the timeline is a bit off. Let me retrace:

1. Started at (38,13), moved west multiple times.
2. Pushed boulder north to (36,13) after moving north.
3. Then moved north again but failed.
4. Then moved west to (35,12).

So the boulder is now at (36,13), and the agent is at (35,12). To get to the boulder, the agent needs to move east to (36,12), then south to (36,13), then east to (37,13) onto the fountain. 

But the current observation shows that the boulder is very near east (36,12), eastsoutheast (37,13), and south (35,13). So the boulder is at (36,12)? Or maybe (36,13)? The message after pushing north said ""With great effort you move the boulder,"" so the previous position was (36,14), now moved to (36,13). 

So the boulder is now at (36,13). The agent is at (35,12). To get to the boulder, move east to (36,12), then south to (36,13). Then push east to (37,13), which is a fountain. 

But the agent is at (35,12). Let's check the map. The map shows at (35,12) the cell is `@`, and the boulder is very near east (36,12). So the agent needs to move east to (36,12), then south to (36,13), then push east. 

But in the current observation, the agent is at (35,12). The possible actions are north, south, east, west. So the best next step is to move east towards the boulder. Once adjacent, push south or east. 

So the action should be east to get closer to the boulder.

19,west,"<reasoning>
Let's try to figure out what to do next in this Boxoban-like environment. The goal is to push the boulder onto the fountain. Let me look at the current state.

The agent is at position (36, 12). The boulder is adjacent to north, east, and southeast. The fountain is adjacent to the west. So the boulder is blocking the way to the fountain. But to push the boulder onto the fountain, the agent needs to position it correctly.

The message says ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" when trying to push it before. That probably means there's an obstacle behind the boulder. Let me check the observations again.

Looking at the language observation, there's a boulder adjacent to north, east, and southeast. The bars adjacent to southwest, west, and northwest. The fountain is adjacent to west. So the boulder is next to the west fountain, but maybe there's something else blocking the path.

Wait, the map shows the agent's position with '@' at (36,12). The boulder might be north of the agent. Let me visualize the map. The agent is at (36,12), and the boulder is adjacent north. So to push the boulder north towards the fountain, the agent needs to move north first, then push the boulder. But perhaps there's an obstacle in the way.

Alternatively, maybe the boulder is east or southeast. Let me check the adjacent directions. If the boulder is east, the agent could try to move west to get behind it. Wait, the agent is at (36,12). If the boulder is east, the agent could move west to position themselves to the west of the boulder, then push it east towards the fountain. But the cursor's x-coordinate is 36, so moving west would take the agent to x=35, which might be next to the boulder.

Wait, the boulder is adjacent to north, east, and southeast. So the boulder is either at (36,11), (37,12), or (37,13). The fountain is adjacent to west, which would be at (35,12). So the agent is at (36,12), and the fountain is at (35,12). The boulder is east at (37,12). To push the boulder west into the fountain at (35,12), the agent needs to be to the east of the boulder. But the agent is currently at (36,12), west of the boulder at (37,12). So to push the boulder west, the agent needs to move east to (37,12) and then push it west. However, the boulder is adjacent to east, so maybe there's another boulder or obstacle there.

Wait, the boulder is adjacent east and southeast. So the boulder at (37,12) also has a boulder to the southeast at (37,13). That might block the path if the agent tries to push the boulder west into the fountain. Because pushing it west would require the path to be clear. But the fountain is at (35,12), so between the boulder at (37,12) and the fountain is the agent's current position at (36,12). So the agent needs to push the boulder from (37,12) to (36,12), which is the agent's current position. But that's occupied by the agent. So that's not possible. Therefore, the agent needs to move out of the way first.

Alternatively, maybe the agent should move north to (36,11), then try to push the boulder north. But the boulder is already adjacent north. If the agent moves north, they might be next to the boulder, allowing them to push it. Wait, the boulder is at (36,11), north of the agent. So the agent is at (36,12), north is (36,11), which has the boulder. To push the boulder north, the agent needs to move north to (36,11) and then push it further north. But where is the path after that? If there's a clear path north from (36,11), then pushing the boulder there would place it on a fountain. But the observation doesn't mention a fountain to the north. The fountain is west at (35,12).

Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me recap:

- Agent is at (36,12).
- Boulder is adjacent north (36,11), east (37,12), southeast (37,13).
- Fountain is at (35,12), adjacent west.
- Need to push the boulder onto the fountain at (35,12).

So to get the boulder to (35,12), the agent must push it west. But the boulder is currently at (37,12), east of the agent. The agent needs to be to the east of the boulder to push it west. So the agent should move east to (37,12), then push west. However, the boulder at (37,12) is adjacent to east and southeast. So pushing west would require clearing the path to (36,12), which is occupied by the agent. So the agent can't be there. Therefore, the agent needs to move out of the way first.

Wait, the agent is at (36,12). To get to (37,12), the boulder's east position, the agent can move east once. Then, from there, push the boulder west. But before that, check if the path west from (37,12) is clear. The agent is at (36,12), so moving the boulder from (37,12) to (36,12) would require the agent to be at (37,12) and then push west into (36,12), which is where the agent is. That's not possible. So the agent needs to move to (37,12), then move to (38,12) to get behind the boulder? But there's a boulder at (37,13), southeast of (37,12). So moving south from (37,12) to (37,13) is blocked by another boulder. Therefore, the agent can't get behind the boulder to push it west into the fountain.

Alternatively, maybe the agent should push the boulder north. The boulder is at (36,11), north of the agent. If the agent moves north to (36,11) and pushes the boulder north to (36,10), then maybe that's a path. But what's beyond (36,10)? There's a dark area mentioned in the language observation. If there's a fountain there, that could work, but the goal is to push the boulder onto the fountain at (35,12). So pushing north might not be the right direction.

Another approach: The agent is at (36,12). The fountain is at (35,12). The boulder is at (37,12). To push the boulder west into the fountain, the agent needs to be to the east of the boulder. So move east to (37,12), then push west. But the path from (37,12) west to (35,12) is blocked by the agent at (36,12). Therefore, the agent needs to move west to (35,12) first, but that's the fountain's position. Wait, the agent can't move onto the fountain; they need to push the boulder there. So perhaps the agent needs to move out of the way.

Wait, maybe the agent should move west to (35,12), which is the fountain, but that's not possible because the agent can't stand on the fountain; they have to push the boulder onto it. So the agent must be adjacent to the boulder to push it. Let me think again.

The agent is at (36,12). The boulder is at (37,12) (east). To push it west, the agent needs to be at (37,12) and then push west. So the agent should move east to (37,12), then push west. However, after pushing, the boulder would move to (36,12), which is where the agent is. That's a problem. So the agent can't be in the way. Therefore, the agent needs to move to a position where they can push the boulder without being in its new position.

Alternatively, maybe the agent can push the boulder in another direction. For example, push it north into a different position, then from there push it west. But that might take multiple steps.

Alternatively, check if there's another boulder that can be moved to create space. But from the observations, there's a boulder at (37,12) and another at (37,13). So pushing the boulder at (37,12) north into (37,11) might be possible if that path is clear. But then from there, pushing west would still require the agent to be positioned correctly.

This is getting complicated. Let's look at the latest observation after moving north:

After moving north to (36,13), the message was ""With great effort you move the boulder."" So that means the boulder was at (36,14) and the agent moved it north to (36,13). Wait, no, when the agent moves north, they would be moving themselves north, and if there's a boulder north of them, they can push it by moving into it. So if the agent is at (36,12) and moves north to (36,11), and there's a boulder at (36,11), then pushing it north to (36,10). But in the latest observation after moving north, the agent is at (36,13), which suggests they moved north twice. Let me check the history.

Wait, in the previous steps, the agent moved north multiple times. Let me trace back:

- Started at (38,13), moved west to (37,13), then south to (37,14), west to (36,14), east to (37,14), north to (37,13), west to (36,13), north to (36,12), west to (35,12), east to (36,12), north to (36,11), then north to (36,10). 

In the latest observation after moving north to (36,10), the message said ""With great effort you move the boulder."" So the boulder was at (36,11) and pushed north to (36,10). Now the agent is at (36,10), and the boulder is at (36,11). The fountain is at (35,12), which is west of the agent's current position.

So now, the agent is at (36,10), and the boulder is at (36,11). To get the boulder to the fountain at (35,12), the agent needs to navigate the boulder there. Let's see the surrounding area.

From (36,10), possible directions: north, south, east, west. The boulder is at (36,11), north of the agent. The agent can move north to be next to the boulder again and push it further north, but that doesn't help. Alternatively, move east to (37,10), then perhaps push the boulder east. But where would that lead? The observation mentions a dark area to the east, so maybe not useful.

Alternatively, the agent could move west to (35,10), then push the boulder west to (35,11), and then to (35,12), which is the fountain. Let's see:

1. Agent is at (36,10), boulder at (36,11).
2. Move west to (35,10).
3. Push boulder west from (36,11) to (35,11).
4. Then move west again to (34,10), push boulder to (34,11), but that's away from the fountain.
5. Alternatively, after pushing to (35,11), move north or south to position for final push.

This seems like a possible path. Let's check if the path from (36,11) west to (35,11) is clear. According to the language observation, there are bars near north, northeast, etc., but not specifically mentioning obstacles in that direction. The dark areas are far north, northeast, and east. So maybe the path is clear.

Alternatively, the agent could move north from (36,10) to (36,9), push the boulder north, but again, not towards the fountain.

Another approach: Once the boulder is at (36,11), the agent can move west to (35,10), then move north or south to get into a position to push the boulder west into the fountain.

But this requires multiple steps. Given the current state, the agent is at (36,10) with the boulder at (36,11). The goal is to get the boulder to (35,12). The direct path is west from (36,11) to (35,11) to (35,12). So the agent needs to move west, then push the boulder west twice.

So the next action should be to move west from (36,10) to (35,10), then push the boulder west to (35,11), then move west again to (34,10), push to (34,11), etc. But maybe there's a better way.

Wait, after moving the agent to (35,10), they can push the boulder from (36,11) to (35,11). Then, from (35,10), the agent can move west to (34,10), then push the boulder from (35,11) to (34,11). But this isn't leading towards the fountain.

Alternatively, after pushing the boulder to (35,11), the agent can move north or south to position themselves to push it west into the fountain. But the fountain is at (35,12), which is north of (35,11). So the agent would need to push the boulder from (35,11) north to (35,12), which is the fountain. But can they do that?

Yes. Here's the plan:

1. Agent at (36,10), push boulder from (36,11) north to (36,10) – but the agent is already there. No, that's not possible. Wait, the agent is at (36,10), and the boulder is at (36,11). If the agent moves north to (36,11), they can push the boulder north to (36,10), but the agent is already there. That won't work.

Alternatively, agent moves west to (35,10), then pushes the boulder west to (35,11). Now the boulder is at (35,11). The agent is at (35,10). Then, the agent can move north to (35,9), then push the boulder north to (35,12), which is the fountain. That could work.

So step by step:

- Current agent position: (36,10)
- Boulder position: (36,11)
- Action 1: west to (35,10)
- Then, push boulder west from (36,11) to (35,11)
- Now agent is at (35,10), boulder at (35,11)
- Action 2: north to (35,9)
- Then push boulder north from (35,11) to (35,12) – the fountain!

This seems feasible. Let's check if there are any obstacles. The language observation mentions bars near north, northnortheast, etc., but not specifically blocking this path. The dark area is far north, so the path from (35,11) north to (35,12) should be clear.

Therefore, the next action should be to move west to (35,10), then push the boulder west. But since the agent is choosing one action at a time, the first step is to move west.

Let's see. The goal is to push the boulder onto the fountains. The agent is a samurai at position (35, 12). Looking at the map and observations, there's a boulder very near east, eastsoutheast, and south. The fountains are near southsoutheast and northwest. The boulder is adjacent to the northeast, so maybe it's next to a fountain?

First, I need to check the current positions. The agent is at (35,12). The boulder is east, so maybe at (36,12). The fountain very near southeast might be at (35,13) or nearby. If the boulder is at (36,12), pushing it east would move it towards the southeast fountain. But need to make sure there's no obstacle behind the boulder. The map shows that at (36,12) there's a boulder, and the agent is at (35,12). So the agent is west of the boulder. To push the boulder east, the agent needs to move east towards it, then push. But when the agent moved east before, they were already at (36,12) and then moved west back. The message says when trying to move the boulder, it failed because it's in vain, probably because there's something behind it or the agent isn't adjacent.

Wait, the latest observation after moving west to (35,12) shows the boulder very near east, eastsoutheast, and south. So the boulder is probably at (36,12), (37,12), or (36,13). The agent is at (35,12). To push the boulder east, the agent needs to be next to it. So the agent should move east to (36,12), then push east again. But when the agent tried moving north or other directions before, the boulder didn't move because maybe they weren't adjacent.

So the plan is: move east to (36,12), then push east towards the southeast fountain. Let's check the map. At (36,12), the agent is at that position. The boulder is very near east, so moving east from (35,12) to (36,12) would place the agent next to the boulder. Then, pushing east would move the boulder to (37,12), which is towards the fountain at southeast. The language observation mentions a fountain very near southeast, so probably at (37,13) or similar. Need to ensure that after pushing, the boulder is on a fountain.

Another thing: the agent has a katana and yumi, but pushing the boulder doesn't require shooting. Just need to move adjacent and push. Also, the dark areas and bars might indicate walls or other obstacles. The map shows lots of ########## which are probably walls. The agent is in a corridor maybe.

So the next action should be east to get next to the boulder, then push east. But in the previous steps, moving east from (35,12) to (36,12) was possible. Then, pushing east would require the action 'push east' or just 'east' again if the game allows that. Wait, the allowed actions are north, east, south, west. So to push the boulder, the agent needs to move in the direction they want to push it. So if the boulder is to the east, the agent needs to move east (which would push the boulder east if there's space).

In the current position (35,12), moving east to (36,12) would place the agent next to the boulder. Then, moving east again (action 'east') would push the boulder east. But we need to check if there's a fountain behind it. The language observation says fountain very near southeast, so maybe at (37,13). If the boulder is pushed to (37,12), then moving it further east to (38,12) would take it towards the fountain. But first, get adjacent.

So steps: move east to (36,12), then east again to push to (37,12). Then check if that's on a fountain. If yes, then success. Otherwise, adjust direction.

Alternatively, if the agent is at (36,12) and pushes east, the boulder moves to (37,12). Then, maybe move north or south to position towards the fountain. But the fountain is southeast, so perhaps moving east again from (37,12) to (38,12), then south to (38,13) where the fountain is.

But need to ensure that the path is clear. The map shows some bars and dark areas, but perhaps the path is open. The agent's current map has a lot of '#' which are walls, so the corridor might be narrow. Let's assume that pushing the boulder east from (36,12) to (37,12) is possible if there's no wall there.

So the next action should be east to get next to the boulder, then another east to push it. Since the previous attempts to move the boulder failed because the agent wasn't adjacent, moving east now should allow pushing.

Let's try to figure out the next move here. The goal is to push the boulder onto the fountain. Let's look at the current situation.

The agent is at position (36, 12). The boulder is very near southsouthwest, so probably located nearby. There's a fountain adjacent to the west, which is a good target. But the boulder is blocking the path. The agent needs to push it towards the fountain.

Looking at the map, the agent is facing east. To reach the fountain west of the boulder, the agent has to move west first, but there's a boulder adjacent to the northwest. Wait, the boulder is at (35, 12)? Or maybe (36, 11)? Not sure about the exact positions. The language observations mention the boulder is north, east, and southeast of the agent's current position. 

The agent tried moving north several times before, but it failed because there was a wall or obstacle. Now, after moving to (36, 12), the agent needs to find a way to position the boulder towards the west fountain. Since the fountain is adjacent to the west, perhaps the boulder needs to be pushed west into that fountain.

But the boulder is currently adjacent to the agent's northwest. So the agent could try to push the boulder west by moving into it from the east. So the agent should move northwest to get next to the boulder, then push it west.

Wait, the agent is at (36,12). If the boulder is adjacent northwest, that would be (35,11). To push it west, the agent would need to move into the boulder's position and then push it. So first, move west to (35,12), then move northwest to (34,11), then push west to (34,10). But the map might have obstacles. Alternatively, the agent could move north first, then west.

Alternatively, since the boulder is adjacent north, east, and southeast, maybe there's a path. Let me check the map again. The map shows #`.{.#.### near the agent's position. The '<' represents the agent. So the agent is standing on a '.' which is a floor. The boulders are nearby.

The agent needs to find a way to navigate to the boulder and push it towards the fountain. The fountain is to the west, adjacent. So if the agent can push the boulder west, that would solve the problem.

Perhaps the best approach is to move west to (35,12), then check if the boulder is there. If the boulder is to the west, the agent can push it. But the current observations say the boulder is very near southsouthwest, which is further south. Hmm, maybe the boulder is at (36, 11) or (35,11).

Wait, the message after moving north said ""With great effort you move the boulder."" So previously, moving north pushed the boulder. Now, the agent is at (36,12), and the boulder is adjacent north, east, and southeast. That suggests the boulder is north of the agent at (36,11), east at (37,12), and southeast at (37,13). But the agent is trying to get it to the fountain at westnorthwest, which is maybe (34,11) or similar.

Alternatively, perhaps the agent should try to move the boulder west by approaching it from the east. So move west to (35,12), then move northwest to (34,11), which is where the boulder might be. Then, push it west to (34,10), which is the fountain.

But I need to make sure there are no walls blocking that path. Looking at the map, the walls are represented by '#'. The agent's current position is near some walls to the north and east, but the west direction seems open. The fountain is adjacent west, so if the boulder can be moved there, that's the solution.

Another thing to consider is that the agent tried moving north multiple times before, but perhaps that's because the boulder was blocking. After pushing the boulder north, moving back might not be necessary. The priority is to get the boulder to the fountain west.

So the next step would be to move west to (35,12), then check the boulder's position. If the boulder is there, push it west. Alternatively, move northwest to get next to the boulder. Let me think.

In the last observation, after moving north, the agent's position is (36,13), but then moved back. Now the agent is at (36,12). The boulder is adjacent north, east, and southeast. So the boulder is likely at (36,11) (north), (37,12) (east), and (37,13) (southeast). To get the boulder to the west fountain, which is at (35,11) or similar, the agent needs to move the boulder west.

The best approach would be to move the boulder east first? No, because the fountain is west. So perhaps the agent should move towards the boulder to the east (37,12) and push it west. But that would take the boulder further east, away from the fountain. Not ideal.

Alternatively, the boulder to the north (36,11) can be pushed west to (35,11), which is towards the fountain. So the agent should move north to (36,11), then push west to (35,11). But the agent is currently at (36,12). Moving north to (36,11) would be possible if there's no wall. The map shows ""#`.{.#.###"", so the agent's current position is on a '.' with a '{}' maybe indicating the boulder's position. Wait, the map might have the boulder represented by 'O' or another character, but in the given map, it's using different symbols. The problem is that the map provided is not clear on the exact positions of the boulders and fountains.

Alternatively, based on the language observations, the fountain is very near south, and adjacent west. The boulder is very near southsouthwest. So the agent is somewhere in the center, and needs to move the boulder southwest towards the fountain.

Given the confusion in the map, the safest action is to move towards the boulder that's adjacent and push it towards the fountain. Since the agent is at (36,12), and the boulder is adjacent north, the agent can move north to (36,11), then push west to (35,11), which is towards the fountain west of (36,12).

So the sequence would be: north to get next to the boulder, then push west. However, the previous attempts to move north resulted in failure, but that might have been because there was a wall. Wait, in the earlier steps, the agent moved north and succeeded in pushing the boulder, but then moving north again failed. Maybe after pushing, the path was blocked.

Alternatively, the agent should try to move west to get next to the boulder that's east of them. If the boulder is at (37,12), moving west to (36,12) is already where the agent is. Then move northwest to (35,11), and push west. But the agent needs to be adjacent to the boulder to push it.

Given the uncertainty in the map, the best action is to move west to (35,12), then check if the boulder is there. If not, try northwest. Alternatively, push the boulder west if possible.

Another possibility is that the agent should move to the position of the boulder and then push it. Since the boulder is adjacent north, the agent can move north to (36,11), then push west towards the fountain at (35,11).

So the chosen action would be north to approach the boulder, then push west. But first, the agent needs to move north. However, in previous steps, moving north failed, but that might have been because the boulder was already pushed. Let me check the history.

In the first few steps, the agent moved north, then south, west, etc. Then when the agent moved north again after pushing, it succeeded. So perhaps now, moving north again would work if the path is clear.

Alternatively, the agent should try to push the boulder west directly. If the boulder is to the north, moving north and then pushing west would move it to the desired position.

In conclusion, the best action is to move north to get next to the boulder, then push west towards the fountain. So the next action would be north, and then push west. But since the agent can only output one action at a time, the first step is to move north to the boulder's position.

I need to figure out the next move in this Boxoban-like game. Let's start by understanding the current situation. The agent is a samurai at position (36, 12). The goal is to push all the boulders onto the fountains.

Looking at the map and observations, there's a boulder adjacent to the north, east, and southeast. The fountain is adjacent to the west. So, the boulder to the north is right next to the agent. The message says trying to move the boulder resulted in failure, which probably means there's something blocking it. 

The language observations mention bars very near the north, northeast, eastnortheast, etc. Maybe there are obstacles or walls there. The agent can't push the boulder north because it's stuck. So, the next best step is to move around the boulder to a position where it can be pushed towards the fountain.

The agent is at (36,12). The boulder to the north is at (36,11) maybe. The fountain is to the west at (35,12). To push the boulder west into the fountain, the agent needs to position themselves to the north of the boulder and push it west. But right now, the agent is south of the boulder. 

So, the agent should move north to get adjacent to the boulder. But earlier attempts to move north resulted in failure, possibly because the boulder is stuck. Wait, no, the message says ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" So, when the agent tried to push the boulder, maybe there's an obstacle behind it. Let me check the map again. 

The map shows a lot of '#' which are walls. The agent's current position is at a spot with some structures. Maybe the boulder is against a wall or another obstacle, making it impossible to push further north. If that's the case, the agent needs to find another way to move the boulder. 

Looking at the adjacent directions: east has a boulder, west has a fountain. The agent could try pushing the east boulder south or west. Let's see. The boulder to the east is at (37,12). If the agent moves east to (37,12), then tries to push the boulder west towards the fountain at (35,12), that might work. But the agent is currently at (36,12). Moving east would take them to (37,12), which is next to the boulder. Then, pushing west would move the boulder to (36,12), which is the agent's current position. But the agent is already there, so that's not helpful. Alternatively, pushing the east boulder south into another position. 

Alternatively, the agent could move south to get a different angle. But the agent is already at the lowest y-coordinate mentioned (12). Moving south would take them out of the map maybe? Not sure. 

Another approach: check the stairs up near eastnortheast. Maybe going up there could change the level, but the goal is to push boulders on this level. So probably not necessary right now. 

The key is to get the boulder adjacent to the fountain. The fountain is at (35,12) west of the agent. The boulder to the north is at (36,11), but it can't be moved north. The boulder to the east is at (37,12). If the agent can push that east boulder west towards the fountain, that would place it on the fountain at (36,12), which is where the agent is now. But the agent needs to position themselves to push it. 

So, moving the agent to the east of the east boulder (which is at (37,12)) would allow pushing it west. The agent is currently at (36,12). Moving east once gets to (37,12), which is next to the boulder. Then, pushing west would move the boulder to (36,12), which is the agent's current position. But that would replace the agent's position with the boulder, which isn't ideal. Maybe the agent needs to move further east first? But there's a boulder there already. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent should move south to avoid the boulders and find another path. But the south direction might have obstacles. 

Wait, the agent's current position is (36,12). The fountain is at (35,12) west. The boulder to the east is at (37,12). If the agent moves west to (35,12), which is the fountain, but there's a boulder adjacent to the west? No, the boulder adjacent to the agent's current position is north, east, and southeast. The west adjacent is the fountain. So, moving west to the fountain's position is possible, but there's a boulder to the north. 

Hmm. Maybe the agent needs to move the north boulder south. But earlier attempts to move it north failed, perhaps because it's stuck. If the agent moves south to (36,13), then tries to push the boulder north again, but that might not help. 

Alternatively, check if there's a way to move the east boulder south into a clear spot. The agent could move east to (37,12), then push the boulder south to (37,13). Then, from there, push it west to (36,13), and then south to (36,14), and place it on the fountain at (35,14)? But the fountain is at (35,12), so that's not matching. 

This is getting complicated. Let's recap:

- Agent at (36,12)
- Boulders at (36,11) north, (37,12) east, (37,13) southeast?
- Fountain at (35,12) west

The immediate goal is to get a boulder onto the fountain at (35,12). The closest boulder is the east one at (37,12). If the agent can push it west to (36,12), then that would block the agent's position. But maybe the agent can push it further west to (35,12), which is the fountain. 

To do that, the agent needs to be adjacent to the east boulder. So move east to (37,12), then push west twice: first to (36,12), then to (35,12) which is the fountain. 

So the steps would be:

1. Move east to (37,12)
2. Push west to (36,12)
3. Push west again to (35,12) onto the fountain

But the agent needs to check if those moves are possible. The first move east is possible if there's no obstacle. The map shows that at (37,12), there's a `#` in the map? Let me check the map again. 

Looking at the map provided, each line seems to represent a row. The agent's position is at (36,12), which corresponds to the 36th character in the 12th row (assuming y=12 is the 12th row from the top). The map rows are filled with '#' and some symbols. For example, the 12th row is: `#`....`<##`... which might mean that at position (36,12), there's a '.' or another character. Wait, the map might be a bit unclear. 

Alternatively, perhaps the agent can move east to (37,12) since there's no wall there. Then push the boulder west. 

So the next action should be to move east to get next to the boulder, then push west. But the agent needs to choose the first action. Since the previous attempts to push failed, moving into position is necessary. 

Therefore, the best next action is to move east to (37,12), which is adjacent to the boulder, allowing the agent to push it west towards the fountain.

Let's see. I need to push a boulder onto a fountain in this game. I'll start by understanding the current situation based on the observation.

The player is at (37, 14) initially but moved around. Now they're at (37, 12). The message says they successfully moved a boulder north previously. The latest successful move was pushing the boulder north, so maybe there's a path there now.

Looking at the map, the agent's position is marked with @. There's a boulder very near north and west, but after moving north, the boulder is now adjacent to east, south, and northwest. The fountains are adjacent to southwest and west. The stairs are up near eastnortheast, but the goal is to get the boulder on the fountain.

The latest action was east, which moved the agent to (37, 12). The boulder is now adjacent to east, south, and northwest. So, the boulder is to the east of the agent? Wait, the boulder adjacent east would mean it's to the east of the agent's current position (37,12). The fountains are adjacent southwest and west. So the agent needs to get the boulder towards the southwest or west.

But the boulder is east of the agent. Maybe the agent needs to move west to be next to the boulder again, then push it south towards the southwest fountain. Or check if there's a clearer path.

Looking at the language observation, there's a fountain very near southwest and west. The bars and dark areas might indicate walls or obstacles. The agent needs to navigate around obstacles to get the boulder to the fountain.

The inventory shows the agent has a katana and a wakizashi, but pushing a boulder would require just moving into it from behind. The boulder can be pushed if there's space behind it.

So the plan is: move west to get next to the boulder, then push it south or southwest towards the fountain. Alternatively, check if moving south from the current position (37,12) is possible. But the message says trying to move the boulder before resulted in failure, so maybe the direction wasn't correct.

Looking at the map, the agent is at (37,12). The boulder is adjacent east. So to push the boulder east, the agent would need to move into the boulder's position from the west. Then push it east. But the fountain is southwest, so maybe pushing it south or southwest.

Wait, the fountains are adjacent southwest and west. If the boulder is pushed towards the southwest fountain, that's the goal. So the agent needs to position themselves such that they can push the boulder southwest.

From the current position (37,12), the boulder is east. If the agent moves west to (36,12), they can then push the boulder east towards (37,12), but that's where the agent is. Alternatively, push the boulder south or southwest.

But the boulder's current adjacent positions are east, south, and northwest. So the boulder might be blocked on the north and west by walls or other obstacles. The agent needs to find a direction where the boulder can be pushed towards the fountain.

Another approach: check the map layout. The agent's position is near some walls (##########), so movement might be restricted. The fountains are in the southwest area. The boulder needs to be moved from its current position east of the agent towards the southwest.

Perhaps moving the agent west to (36,12) and then pushing the boulder south into the fountain. Alternatively, check if the boulder can be pushed east first to clear a path, then south.

Wait, the latest successful move was pushing the boulder north, which moved it to (36,13). Now the boulder is at (37,12)'s east? Or maybe the coordinates are different. Need to clarify the map.

Looking at the map, the agent's position is marked with @ at (36,12) after moving west. The boulder is adjacent east, so it's at (37,12). The fountain is adjacent southwest, which would be (36,11) perhaps. So to push the boulder from (37,12) to (36,11) southwest, the agent needs to be south of the boulder and push it southwest. But can the agent move into position?

The agent is at (36,12). To push the boulder southwest, the agent needs to be south of it. So the agent would need to move south to (36,11), then push the boulder southwest to (35,10), but that might not be towards the fountain. Alternatively, push the boulder south to (37,11), then from there push further southwest.

But the fountain is at (36,11), which is southwest of the agent's current position. So if the boulder can be moved to (36,11), that's the fountain. To do that, the agent needs to be at (35,11) and push the boulder east to (36,11). But how to get there?

Alternatively, the agent can move west to (35,12), then push the boulder east to (36,12), but that's where the agent is. Maybe the agent needs to move south to (36,11), then push the boulder east to (37,11), then push again southeast to (37,12), but that's not the fountain. Hmm.

This is getting a bit confusing. Let's recap:

- Agent is at (36,12).
- Boulder is at (37,12) (east of agent).
- Fountain is at (36,11) (southwest of agent).
- To push the boulder to the fountain at (36,11), the agent needs to be south of the boulder and push it southwest.

So the steps would be:

1. Move the agent south to (36,11).
2. Push the boulder from (37,12) to (36,11) (south direction).
3. Now the boulder is at (36,11), which is the fountain. Success!

But can the agent move south from (36,12) to (36,11)? The map shows that the agent is in a position where moving south might be possible if there's no wall. Looking at the map, the line for y=11 is not shown, but assuming it's possible, the agent can move south.

Alternatively, maybe the boulder is blocked on the north side. Earlier, the boulder was adjacent north, but after moving north, it's now adjacent east, south, and northwest. So the boulder's current position might have space to the south.

So the plan is:

- Move south to (36,11).
- Push the boulder south to (37,11).
- Then move west to (36,11) and push again southwest? Or find another path.

Wait, pushing the boulder south from (37,12) to (37,11), then from there, push southwest to (36,10), which is not the fountain. The fountain is at (36,11). So perhaps after pushing the boulder to (37,11), the agent needs to move west and push it south again.

Alternatively, push the boulder directly southwest from (37,12) to (36,11) in one move. That would require the agent to be south-west of the boulder. But the agent is at (36,12), which is west of the boulder. To push southwest, the agent needs to be to the north and west of the boulder. Wait, pushing a boulder southwest would mean the agent moves into the boulder from the northeast direction. So the agent would need to be at (36,13) (north of boulder at 37,12) and then move southwest into the boulder, pushing it to (36,11).

But the agent is currently at (36,12). To get to (36,13), the agent would need to move north. But earlier attempts to move north resulted in failure, possibly because the boulder is there. Wait, previously, the agent moved the boulder north to (36,13), so now the boulder is at (36,13). Wait, maybe there's confusion in coordinates.

Let me recheck the map and positions. After the agent moved north previously, the boulder was moved. The latest map shows the agent at (36,12) after moving west. The boulder is adjacent east, so at (37,12). The fountain is adjacent southwest, which would be (36,11).

So to push the boulder southwest from (37,12) to (36,11), the agent needs to be at (36,13) (north of the boulder) and move southwest into it. But the agent is at (36,12), which is south of the boulder's current position (37,12). So the agent can't be north of the boulder. Therefore, this approach might not work.

Alternative idea: Move the agent west to (35,12), then push the boulder east to (36,12), but that's where the agent is. Not helpful.

Alternatively, move the agent east to (37,12) and push the boulder south. But the agent is already next to the boulder's east side. If the agent moves east into the boulder, they can push it. But the boulder is at (37,12), and the agent is at (36,12). Moving east to (37,12) would place the agent on the boulder, which isn't allowed. Instead, the agent needs to push the boulder by moving into it from behind.

So the agent should be west of the boulder to push it east, or south of the boulder to push it north, etc. Since the boulder is at (37,12) and the agent is at (36,12), the agent is west of the boulder. To push the boulder east, the agent needs to move into the boulder's position from the west. But the agent is already west. Wait, no: to push the boulder east, the agent needs to move east into the boulder's current position. So the agent is at (36,12), moves east to (37,12), which is the boulder's position, but that's not allowed. Instead, the agent should move into the boulder's position from the west, then push it east. Wait, no. The agent needs to be adjacent to the boulder and move in the direction opposite to where they want to push it.

For example, to push the boulder east, the agent should be west of it and move east into it. So agent at (36,12) moves east to (37,12), pushing the boulder east to (38,12). But the goal is to get it to the fountain at (36,11). That's not helpful.

Alternatively, to push the boulder south, the agent needs to be north of it. The boulder is at (37,12), so the agent would need to be at (37,11) to push it south to (37,11). But the agent is at (36,12). To get to (37,11), the agent would need to move south to (36,11), then east to (37,11), then push the boulder south. But that's a two-step movement.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Agent is at (36,12).
2. Move south to (36,11).
3. Move east to (37,11).
4. Push the boulder south from (37,12) to (37,11) by moving the agent into (37,11) and pushing.
5. Now the boulder is at (37,11).
6. Move west to (36,11).
7. Push the boulder southwest to (35,10), which is not the fountain. Not helpful.

Alternatively, after step 4, the boulder is at (37,11). Then the agent is at (37,11). To push it southwest to (36,10), but the fountain is at (36,11). Not useful.

Hmm. Maybe the correct approach is to push the boulder directly south to (37,11), then from there push it southwest to (36,10), but that's not the fountain. Alternatively, after pushing to (37,11), move west and push again south.

Alternatively, the agent could push the boulder southwest in one move if they position themselves correctly. To do that, the agent needs to be to the north and west of the boulder. The boulder is at (37,12). The agent would need to be at (36,13) (northwest of the boulder) and then move southwest into the boulder, pushing it to (36,11). That's the fountain!

So steps:

1. Agent is at (36,12).
2. Move north to (36,13).
3. Now, from (36,13), move southwest into the boulder at (37,12), pushing it to (36,11), which is the fountain.

But can the agent move north from (36,12) to (36,13)? In previous steps, moving north resulted in failing to push the boulder, but that was when the boulder was in a different position. Now, the boulder is at (37,12), so moving north to (36,13) is possible if there's no obstacle.

Looking at the map, the line for y=13 shows ""#`.{.#.###"", which at x=36 is probably a floor (since the agent is at x=36, y=12). So moving north to y=13, x=36 should be possible.

Once the agent is at (36,13), moving southwest would take them to (37,12), which is the boulder's current position. Pushing the boulder southwest would move it to (36,11), the fountain.

This seems like the correct path. So the actions needed are:

north to (36,13), then southwest.

But the available actions are only north, south, east, west. Wait, no, the possible actions are the four directions. To move southwest, the agent would need to move south then west, or west then south. But the action choices are only the four primary directions. So the agent can't move diagonally. Therefore, to push the boulder southwest, the agent has to move in one primary direction and hope that the boulder can be pushed in the diagonal direction by combined movements.

Wait, in Boxoban, you can push a boulder by moving into it in any of the four primary directions. The boulder will be pushed in the same direction you moved, but only if there's space behind it. So to push the boulder southwest, the agent needs to move south into the boulder, and if there's space to the west of the boulder, it will be pushed southwest.

Wait, no. If the agent moves south into the boulder, the boulder will be pushed south. To push it southwest, the agent needs to move southwest, but the game only allows primary directions. So perhaps the agent needs to move south and then west, but that would require two actions. Alternatively, if the agent can move south into the boulder, then the boulder is pushed south, and if there's a space to the west, the agent can then move west, and the boulder would be pushed west. But that's two separate pushes.

Alternatively, if the agent can position the boulder such that pushing it south first, then west, both into the fountain.

But the fountain is at (36,11), which is southwest of the agent's current position. So pushing the boulder south to (37,11), then west to (36,11).

So steps:

1. Move north to (36,13).
2. Move southwest by first moving south to (36,12), then west to (35,12), but that's not helpful. Alternatively, from (36,13), move south to (36,12), then west to (35,12), then south to (35,11), then east to (36,11). This seems complicated.

Alternatively, after moving north to (36,13), push the boulder south to (37,13). But the fountain is at (36,11), so that's not helpful.

This is getting a bit stuck. Let's try to focus on the immediate actions possible.

Current position: (36,12)
Boulder at (37,12)
Fountain at (36,11)

Possible actions:

- Move west to (35,12)
- Move south to (36,11)
- Move east to (37,12) (but that's the boulder, can't move there)
- Move north to (36,13)

If the agent moves south to (36,11), they are now at the fountain's position. Then, if they push the boulder south from (37,12) to (37,11), but the agent is at (36,11), which is west of the boulder. To push the boulder south, the agent needs to be north of it. So from (36,11), the agent can't push the boulder south because it's to the east.

Alternatively, move the agent to (37,11) and push the boulder south. But how?

This is tricky. Maybe the correct action is to move south to (36,11), then somehow push the boulder. But the agent is west of the boulder, so they can't push it south from there.

Another approach: Since the boulder is at (37,12) and the agent is at (36,12), the agent can push the boulder east by moving east into it. But that would move the boulder to (38,12), which is away from the fountain. Not useful.

Alternatively, push the boulder north. But earlier attempts to move north resulted in failure, possibly because there's a wall or another obstacle. Looking at the map, the agent's current position is at y=12. The line for y=11 is not shown, but the map's structure shows walls (##########) which might block movement north.

Given the confusion in coordinates and the map layout, perhaps the best immediate action is to move south to (36,11) to get closer to the fountain and see if the boulder can be pushed from there.

So the chosen action is south.

Let's see. The goal is to push the boulder onto the fountain. From the previous actions and observations, the agent has moved the boulder once already when it went north. Now, the current position is (37, 14) after moving west, then north again. The boulder is adjacent to north and northwest. The message after moving north previously said ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain,"" which probably means there's something blocking it.

Looking at the map, the agent is at (37,14), and the boulder is adjacent north and northwest. The fountains are at southwest and northwest. Wait, the fountain adjacent southwest was mentioned before. So maybe the boulder needs to be pushed towards the southwest fountain.

The last valid movement was moving the boulder north, so perhaps the agent should try pushing it again in a direction that leads it toward a fountain. Since the boulder is currently adjacent north and northwest, maybe pushing it northwest would move it closer to the fountain at northwest. Alternatively, pushing it north again might not work if there's a wall or another obstacle now. 

Looking at the language observation, there's a fountain very near northwest, and the boulder is adjacent north and northwest. So if the agent can push the boulder northwest, that would place it on the fountain. But the problem is the ""message: You try to move the boulder, but in vain"" when moving north. Maybe the boulder is blocked by another obstacle in the north direction now. So the agent should try a different direction.

Alternatively, the boulder might need to be moved in a way that creates space. Since pushing north didn't work, maybe moving west or southwest could allow moving the boulder. But the agent's current position is (37,14), and the boulder is at (37,13) north and (36,14) northwest. Wait, perhaps the agent needs to position themselves next to the boulder in the correct direction to push it towards the fountain.

Wait, the cursor position after moving north previously was (36,13). Then moving west to (35,12), then east back to (36,12), then north to (36,11). Wait, maybe I need to track the exact positions more carefully. Alternatively, perhaps the best move is to try pushing the boulder again in a direction where there's no obstacle. Since moving north previously didn't work, maybe trying to push it west or southwest.

Looking at the map, the boulder is at (37,13) north and (36,14) northwest. The fountain is at southwest. So pushing the boulder southwest might be the way. To do that, the agent needs to be adjacent to the boulder in the southwest direction. The agent is currently at (37,14), which is south of the boulder's north position (37,13). So if the agent moves west to (36,14), which is next to the boulder's northwest position (36,14), then they can push it northwest or southwest. Wait, the boulder is at (37,13) north and (36,14) northwest. So if the agent is at (36,14), they can push the boulder west (southwest direction) towards the fountain at southwest.

So the plan is: move west to (36,14), then push the boulder west (southwest) onto the fountain. But the agent's current position after the last action (south) is (37,13). Wait, the last observation after moving south had the agent at (37,13). So from there, moving west to (36,13), then south to (36,12), but maybe a different path. Alternatively, from (37,13), move west to (36,13), then try pushing the boulder west or southwest.

Alternatively, since the boulder is adjacent north and northwest, maybe pushing it northwest from position (37,13) would move it to (36,12), which is towards the fountain at northwest. But the fountain adjacent southwest is mentioned, so maybe the correct target is the southwest fountain. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the agent needs to move the boulder to the fountain at northwest. The boulder is currently at (37,13) north and (36,14) northwest. If the agent can push it northwest from (36,14), that would place it on the fountain. So to do that, the agent needs to be at (36,14) and push the boulder northwest. But the agent's current position is (37,13). So moving west to (36,13), then north to (36,12), then west to (35,12), but that might not be the right path.

Alternatively, the agent can move to the northwest of the boulder. The boulder's northwest position is (36,14), so the agent needs to be at (36,14) to push it. From (37,13), moving west to (36,13), then north to (36,12), then east to (37,12), but that's not helpful. Maybe moving west twice to (36,13) and then south to (36,12), then west to (35,12). This is getting complicated. Maybe a better approach is to look for the direction where the boulder can be pushed towards a fountain without obstacles.

The latest language observation says the boulder is adjacent north and northwest, and the fountain is adjacent southwest. So pushing the boulder southwest would move it towards the southwest fountain. To do that, the agent needs to be to the southwest of the boulder. The boulder is at (37,13) north and (36,14) northwest. The southwest direction from the boulder would be to (37,14) south and (36,13) southeast. Wait, maybe the agent is already at (37,13), which is south of the boulder's north position. So if the agent moves east to (38,13), they can push the boulder east, but that's not towards a fountain. 

Alternatively, the agent should try pushing the boulder northwest from its current position. If the agent is at (37,13) and the boulder is at (37,13) north and (36,14) northwest, then pushing the boulder northwest would require the agent to be at (36,13) and push it to (35,12). But that might not lead to a fountain. 

This is getting a bit confusing. Let's look at the latest map. The agent is at (37,13). The boulder is adjacent north (37,12) and northwest (36,13). The fountain is adjacent southwest, which would be at (38,12) or similar. To push the boulder towards the southwest fountain, the agent needs to move it in a direction that heads southwest. From the boulder's current position at (37,12) north and (36,13) northwest, pushing it southwest would mean the agent is at (36,13) and pushes it to (35,12). Then from there, pushing again towards the fountain. But maybe there's a better path.

Alternatively, the agent could move to the northwest of the boulder (position 36,13) and push it northwest to (35,12), which is towards the fountain at southwest. But the exact positions need to be verified. 

Another approach: since the agent successfully pushed the boulder north once, maybe they can try pushing it again in a different direction. The message when pushing north previously said ""vain"" because there was an obstacle. Now, after moving south, the agent is at (37,13). If they move west to (36,13), which is adjacent to the boulder's northwest position (36,14)? Wait, maybe the coordinates are a bit off. Let me try to visualize the grid.

Assuming the agent is at (37,13), and the boulder is at (37,12) to the north, and (36,13) to the northwest. So the agent is south of the boulder's north edge and west of the boulder's northwest edge. To push the boulder northwest, the agent needs to be at (36,13) and push it to (35,12). So the agent should move west to (36,13), then push northwest (which would be the direction towards (35,12)). This would move the boulder closer to the fountain at southwest.

Alternatively, if the agent moves to (36,13) and pushes the boulder west (southwest), that would be the direction towards the fountain. 

Given that the fountains are at southwest and northwest, but the agent needs to get the boulder onto one of them. The latest observation mentions a fountain adjacent southwest, so pushing the boulder towards there makes sense.

So the steps would be:

1. Agent is at (37,13).
2. Move west to (36,13) to be adjacent to the boulder's northwest position (36,13).
3. Push the boulder northwest (direction to (35,12)), which would move it towards the southwest fountain.

But wait, pushing northwest from (36,13) would move the boulder to (35,12), which is southwest from the agent's new position. That seems correct.

Alternatively, if the agent pushes the boulder southwest from (36,13), it would go to (37,12), which is the same as the previous position. Not helpful.

So the correct action is to move west to (36,13) and then push the boulder northwest. However, the available actions are north, east, south, west. So the agent needs to first move west, then determine the correct push direction. But in the current observation, the agent's previous action was south, moving to (37,13). The next step is to move west to (36,13), then the action would be to push the boulder in a direction, but the allowed actions are only the four cardinal directions. Wait, no—the agent can only move in the four directions, but to push a boulder, the agent must move into it, which would push the boulder in the opposite direction. For example, if the agent moves north into the boulder, the boulder moves south.

So in this case, the agent is at (37,13), and the boulder is at (37,12) to the north. If the agent moves north into the boulder, the boulder would move south to (37,11). But that's not towards a fountain. Alternatively, if the agent is at (36,13) and moves northwest (which isn't a direct action), but to simulate a push, the agent would need to move in the direction opposite to where they want the boulder to go. For example, to push the boulder northwest, the agent would move southeast into it. But the available actions are only north, east, south, west.

This is a bit tricky. The correct way to push the boulder in a direction is for the agent to move towards the boulder from the side opposite to the desired direction. For example, to push the boulder northwest, the agent needs to move southeast into it. However, since the agent can only move north, south, east, or west, they can't directly move southeast. Therefore, the agent must position themselves adjacent to the boulder in the correct direction and then move towards it in the opposite direction to push.

So, if the boulder is at (37,12) north of the agent's current position (37,13), and the agent wants to push it northwest, they need to be to the northwest of the boulder. The boulder's northwest corner is at (36,13). So the agent needs to move to (36,13), which is west of their current position. Once there, moving east into the boulder would push it west. Wait, that would push it west, not northwest. To push northwest, the agent needs to move southeast into the boulder. But since they can't move southeast, this isn't possible. 

Alternatively, if the agent is at (36,14) and moves northwest (which isn't an option), but they can move west to (35,14), then move north to (35,13), then move west to (34,13), etc. This seems complicated. Maybe the best approach is to push the boulder north again, but that didn't work before. 

Wait, in the previous step, after moving south to (37,13), the agent tried to push north, but it failed. Maybe there's a wall or another obstacle now. Looking at the map, there are a lot of '#' which represent walls or unfloor tiles. The map shows areas with '...' and '#' blocking paths. So the agent needs to navigate around walls to push the boulder into a fountain.

Given the current position (37,13) and the boulder at (37,12) north and (36,13) northwest, the agent should try to move to the northwest of the boulder to push it towards the fountain. Moving west to (36,13), then moving north into the boulder would push it south to (37,12), which is the same position. Not helpful. 

Alternatively, moving west to (36,13), then moving southwest (but that's not an action). Wait, perhaps the agent needs to move to (36,13) and then push the boulder west. To do that, the agent would move east into the boulder from the west. So from (36,13), moving east into the boulder at (36,13) would push it west to (35,13). But is there a fountain there? The fountain is adjacent southwest, which might be at (38,12) or similar. This is unclear.

Alternatively, considering the latest language observation, there's a fountain very near northwest. If the boulder can be pushed to the northwest fountain, that would solve the problem. The boulder's current position is north and northwest of the agent. To push it to the northwest fountain, the agent needs to move it in that direction. 

Perhaps the correct action is to move west to (36,13) and then push the boulder northwest by moving southeast into it. But since the agent can only move north, south, east, or west, this isn't feasible. Therefore, the agent must find a path around the walls to position themselves correctly.

Looking at the map, there's a '<' symbol at (37,12), which might be a door or a special tile. The agent needs to navigate around these to push the boulder. 

Another possibility is that the agent should move south to (37,12), which is where the boulder is north of that position. Then, moving north into the boulder would push it further north, but that's unlikely to help. 

Given the confusion and the need to avoid repeating actions, the best immediate action is to try pushing the boulder in a direction that wasn't blocked before. Since moving north previously failed, maybe moving west to (36,13) and then attempting to push the boulder west or northwest. 

The final decision is to move west to (36,13) and then push the boulder northwest. But since the agent can only move in the four directions, the actual action would be to move west, and then the next action would be to push north into the boulder. However, in the current step, the agent needs to choose between north, east, south, west. Given that the agent is at (37,13) and the boulder is at (37,12) north, moving north would try to push it again, but it failed before. So perhaps moving west to (36,13) is the better move to position for a different push.

Let's try to figure out the next move here. The agent is in Boxoban, so the goal is to push all the boulders onto the fountains. Looking at the current observation, the agent is at position (36, 13) after moving west. The map shows some fountains near the east and northwest, and there's a boulder adjacent to the southeast and southwest.

The inventory has a katana, wakizashi, a bow, arrows, and some armor. The message says the agent successfully moved a boulder earlier, so maybe that's one towards a fountain. Now, the boulders are very near north and eastnortheast, but the agent needs to check their positions relative to the fountains.

The language observation mentions a fountain adjacent to east and northwest. The agent is at (36,13). If there's a fountain to the east, pushing a boulder there would help. The boulder very near north might need to be moved south towards a fountain. Alternatively, the boulder southeast and southwest of the agent could be pushed towards the fountains mentioned.

Looking at the map, the agent's current position is marked with @. The boulder adjacent southeast and southwest might be in positions that can be pushed north or east. The stairs up are near eastnortheast, but the priority is pushing boulders to fountains.

The agent should check which boulders are not yet on fountains and plan a path. Since the previous move was west, maybe moving east again to interact with the boulder there. Alternatively, moving north to where the boulder is very near northnortheast and push it towards the fountain in the northwest.

Wait, the fountain is adjacent east and northwest. If the agent moves east and pushes a boulder into the east fountain, that would be good. The boulder very near eastnortheast might be close enough to push east into the fountain. So the next action could be east to get closer to that boulder and then push it east.

Let's see. I need to figure out the next move in this Boxoban-like game. The goal is to push the boulders onto the fountains. The agent is a samurai, and the current position is (37,13). The map shows some areas with bars, dark regions, stairs, fountains, and boulders.

First, looking at the observations: there's a boulder adjacent to the northeast and south. The fountains are very near the southsouthwest and westnorthwest. The agent just moved east and ended up at (37,13). The message after moving east says ""With great effort you move the boulder,"" which means they successfully pushed a boulder. But where is it now?

The current cursor position is (37,13). The map shows some symbols like < and # which might be the agent, boulders, walls, etc. The agent needs to check where the boulders are now. The language observation mentions a boulder adjacent northeast and south. So, after pushing the boulder east, it's probably now at (38,13) or (37,14). But since the agent moved east, maybe the boulder was south of the agent before and was pushed north?

Wait, when you push a boulder, you move into it, and it moves in the direction you're pushing. So if the agent was at (36,12) and pushed east, the boulder that was adjacent east would move further east. But looking at previous steps, after moving east from (36,12) to (37,12), the message said the boulder was moved, which suggests the boulder was adjacent to the agent's previous position (36,12) and was pushed east to (37,12). Now, after moving south to (37,13), the boulder might be at (37,12) or somewhere else.

But the current observation says the boulder is adjacent northeast and south. The agent is at (37,13). Northeast would be (38,14), and south would be (37,14). So maybe the boulder is south of the agent now. The fountains are at southsouthwest and westnorthwest. Southsouthwest would be towards (37,14) maybe? Not sure.

The agent's inventory has a katana, yumi, and some arrows. Maybe not necessary right now. The main task is to push the boulders to the fountains. The agent needs to navigate to the boulder and push it towards a fountain.

Looking at the map, the agent is in a corridor with walls around. The stairs up are near eastnortheast. The dark areas are various, but the key is the fountains. The best approach is to push the boulder towards the fountain in the southwest. The previous steps had the boulder moved east, so maybe now it's positioned to be pushed further south into the fountain.

The current position is (37,13). If the boulder is south at (37,14), pushing it south would take it to (37,15), but need to check if there's a fountain there. Alternatively, if the boulder is east at (38,13), pushing it south-east might get it to a fountain.

But the fountains are very near westnorthwest. That's probably up north. Wait, the fountain adjacent southwest. The agent is at (37,13), southwest would be (36,14). Maybe there's a fountain there. If the boulder is at (37,14), pushing it southwest towards (36,14) where the fountain is, that could work.

So the agent should move south to be next to the boulder, then push it southwest. But the current position is (37,13). Moving south to (37,14) would place the agent adjacent to the boulder. Then push it southwest (southwest action). Alternatively, if the boulder is northeast, pushing it north or west.

Wait, the observation says the boulder is adjacent northeast and south. So from (37,13), northeast is (38,14), and south is (37,14). So there are two boulders? Or maybe one boulder in both directions? That seems unlikely. Probably, there's a boulder to the northeast and another to the south. But that might not make sense. Maybe it's a single boulder that's in both directions relative to the agent. Hmm, maybe the agent is surrounded by boulders? Unlikely.

Alternatively, the boulder could be at (38,13) (east) and when pushed, moved to (38,14), making it adjacent northeast from (37,13). Or maybe the boulder was pushed earlier and is now in a different position.

This is getting a bit confusing. Let's look at the map. The agent's position is marked with @, and there are some # symbols which are walls, < is the goal (fountain?), and . are floors. The boulders are probably denoted by a specific symbol, but in the map provided, I don't see any obvious boulder indicators. The language observations mention boulders, so they must be represented somehow on the map, maybe by 'o' or another character. But in the given map, I see symbols like {, }, `, ., @, etc. Maybe the boulders are the { or } symbols?

Looking at the map from previous steps, when the agent moved the boulder east, the map showed #`.@.#.###, which might indicate the boulder's position. It's a bit unclear. Alternatively, the boulders could be the '{' or '}' characters. For example, in the line #`.@.#.###, the '@' is the agent, and the '{' might be a boulder.

In the current map, the line is #`.`.#.###. So no boulders visible here. But the language observation says there's a boulder adjacent northeast and south. So perhaps the boulder is off the current view of the map? Or the map representation is different.

Given the uncertainty, the safest bet is to move towards the direction where the boulder is adjacent, which is south (37,14). So moving south to get next to the boulder and then push it towards the fountain in the southwest. Alternatively, if the boulder is to the northeast, moving north or west.

But considering the previous moves, the agent pushed a boulder east to (37,12), then moved south to (37,13). Now, the boulder adjacent south would be at (37,14). The fountain adjacent southwest is at (36,14). So pushing the boulder from (37,14) to (36,14) would place it on the fountain.

So the steps would be: move south to (37,14), then push south-west (sw) to (36,14), which is the fountain. Therefore, the action should be 'south' to get next to the boulder, then 'southwest' to push it into the fountain.

But the current observation is at (37,13). The message after moving east was that the boulder was moved. So the agent is now at (37,13), and the boulder is either at (37,12) (south) or (38,13) (east). If the boulder was pushed east from (36,12) to (37,12), then it's now at (37,12). But the current observation says the boulder is adjacent northeast and south. So from (37,13), northeast is (38,14), which doesn't align with the previous movement. Maybe the boulder is now at (37,14) south of the agent.

So the agent should move south to (37,14), then push southwest towards (36,14) where the fountain is. Therefore, the next action is 'south' to approach the boulder, then 'southwest' to push it.

Alternatively, if the boulder is to the northeast at (38,14), the agent could move northeast or west to get adjacent. But the fountains are more urgently in the southwest.

Given the information, the best move is to move south to get next to the boulder and then push it southwest into the fountain.

Let's try to figure out the next step here. The goal is to push the boulders onto the fountains. From the current observations, the agent is at position (37,13). There's a boulder adjacent to the northeast and south. The nearest fountains are southsouthwest and westnorthwest.

The previous attempts to move the boulder north and other directions didn't work because maybe the boulder is stuck against another obstacle or wall. So, the agent needs to find a way to position themselves so they can push the boulder towards a fountain.

Looking at the map, the agent is near a staircase up to the eastnortheast. But the current priority is moving the boulder. The boulder to the northeast might be blocking the path. If the agent moves west, they could get closer to the southern boulder. Alternatively, moving south might allow pushing the southern boulder towards the southwest fountain.

Alternatively, maybe the agent should try pushing the northern boulder. But the latest message says trying to move the boulder north didn't work. Perhaps there's a wall there. So, focusing on the southern boulder. If the agent moves south, they can try pushing it towards the fountain. Or maybe move west to get a better angle.

Wait, the current position is (37,13). The southern boulder is adjacent south. If the agent moves south to (37,14), then they can try pushing the boulder south into the fountain at southwest. Let me check the fountain positions. The language observation mentions a fountain adjacent southwest, which is probably at (37,14) or nearby. So moving the southern boulder there would solve the puzzle.

So, the plan is to move south to (37,14) and then push the boulder south into the fountain. Let's check the last observation: the message was trying to move the boulder but failed. That might have been when trying to push north. Now, if the agent moves south and then pushes, it should work.

Let's see where I am in this Boxoban game. The goal is to push all the boulders onto the fountains. The current observation shows that I'm at position (37, 13). There are two boulders nearby: one very near north and west, and another adjacent northeast and south.

The map shows some walls represented by '#' and fountains marked with '<'. From the previous actions, I tried moving north, west, east, and south multiple times. The last successful move was pushing a boulder east, which might have placed it on a fountain. But now, when I tried moving another boulder south, it didn't budge, meaning there's an obstacle blocking its path.

Looking at the cursor position and the nearby boulders, the boulder adjacent to the northeast might be the one I need to move. The message says moving the boulder in vain, so I need to check if there's something blocking it. Maybe another boulder or a wall. The map has a lot of walls, so perhaps the path is blocked. 

I should check possible directions. Since the boulder is to the northeast, maybe pushing it west could free it up. Alternatively, moving around to the east or north to find a way to push it towards the fountain. But the latest observations didn't show any change after moving south. 

Wait, the fountain adjacent southwest might be where a boulder needs to go. If the boulder is blocking the path, I need to reposition myself to push it in the right direction. Maybe moving west to get behind the boulder and then push it south. 

Alternatively, check if the boulder next to the northeast is stuck because another boulder is blocking its path. If so, I need to move that other boulder first. But from the current observations, the boulders are at specific positions. 

Given the last action was south and it failed, perhaps trying to move east again to see if I can get closer to the boulder. Or west to try a different approach. 

I think the best move here is to try pushing the boulder to the northeast. Since it's adjacent northeast, maybe moving west would allow me to push it south towards the fountain. Let me try west again to position myself behind it.

Let's see. The goal is to push the boulders onto the fountains. From the current observation, there's a boulder adjacent to the northwest and northeast. I need to figure out which direction to move it.

Looking at the map, the player is at (36,13). The boulders are nearby. The message history shows that moving east once allowed pushing a boulder before, but now it's not working. Maybe the boulder is stuck because there's something behind it now. Let me check the recent observations.

The last successful move was when the agent moved east, which pushed a boulder. But after that, trying to move north or south again resulted in failure. The cursor is now back at (36,13). The adjacent boulders are north and northeast. The fountains are west and east. 

I need to try pushing one of the boulders towards a fountain. The boulder to the north is at (36,12), and the fountain is adjacent to the southwest. Wait, maybe the boulder to the northeast (37,13) is next to a fountain to the east? Or maybe the southwest fountain is at (35,13)? Not sure about the exact positions.

Alternatively, the boulder at (37,12) was moved east before. If I can get to that area again and push it south towards the fountain. Let me check the cursor position. The agent is at (36,13). Moving north would take them to (36,12), where there's a boulder. But trying to push it north again didn't work before. Maybe they need to move it east instead.

Wait, the last successful move was pushing the boulder east to (37,12). Now the boulder is at (37,12), and there's a fountain adjacent to the west (southwest?). If I can move that boulder further east towards the fountain. But the agent is at (36,13). How to get there?

The agent needs to move east to (37,13), then south to (37,12), and then push the boulder east again. But in the last steps, moving south from (37,13) was unsuccessful. Maybe there's an obstacle. Alternatively, the agent could move north to (36,12) where another boulder is, and try pushing it east or south.

Looking at the latest map, the agent's position is (36,13) with a boulder to the north (36,12) and northeast (37,13). The fountains are adjacent to west and east. Maybe pushing the northeast boulder towards the east fountain. To do that, the agent needs to move to (37,13), then east to (38,13), but is that path clear?

Alternatively, the boulder at (37,12) (south of the agent's current position) was moved there before. If the agent moves south to (36,12), then east to (37,12), they can try pushing the boulder further east towards the fountain. But the message said trying to move the boulder north or south in vain, so maybe need to try a different direction.

Another approach: check if the boulder at (37,13) can be pushed south towards the fountain. The agent is at (36,13). Move east to (37,13), then south to (37,12), then push the boulder east. But need to ensure the path is clear behind the boulder.

Alternatively, maybe the agent should move west to (35,13) and check the boulder there. But the boulder adjacent to southwest might be in a different position. 

Considering the previous successful move was pushing east, perhaps repeating that action where possible. If the agent moves east to (37,13), then south to (37,12), and then push east again, that might place the boulder on the fountain. However, the last time they tried moving south from (37,13), it didn't work. Need to check the map again.

The map shows the agent's position with '@' at (36,13). The boulder adjacent northeast is at (37,13). The fountain is adjacent to east and southwest. If the agent moves east to (37,13), then pushes the boulder east to (38,13), which should be towards the fountain. But need to confirm if there's an obstacle there.

In the current language observation, there are bars very near northeast, southeast, etc., but the specific positions might indicate obstacles. Without the exact map layout, it's a bit hard, but the agent needs to try pushing the boulder in a direction towards a fountain.

Given the previous success with pushing east, the next logical step is to move east to the boulder and push it further east towards the fountain. So the chosen action should be east again.

I need to figure out the next move here. Let's start by looking at the current situation. The agent is in a Boxoban-like environment, trying to push boulders onto fountains. The key elements are the boulders and fountains on the map.

From the observations, there's a boulder very near southsouthwest and northnorthwest. The agent is at position (37,13). The fountains are near southsouthwest and westnorthwest. The message history shows previous attempts to move boulders, sometimes successfully. 

Looking at the map, the agent is facing some obstacles. The cursor shows the agent's position, and the map has various symbols, but it's a bit hard to parse without seeing it clearly. However, the language observations mention bars and dark areas, which might represent walls or other obstacles. 

The latest message says the agent tried to move the boulder but failed. That probably means there's something blocking the boulder's path, like another obstacle or a wall. The agent needs to position itself correctly to push the boulder in the right direction. 

The goal is to get all boulders onto fountains. The current boulders are near southsouthwest and northnorthwest. The fountains are at southsouthwest and westnorthwest. So, maybe the boulder at northnorthwest needs to be moved towards westnorthwest. But the agent is currently at (37,13), which is east of that area. 

The agent tried moving north, east, south, and west multiple times, but sometimes it successfully moves a boulder. Now, the last action was south, which failed. The agent should try to get around the blocking obstacle. Perhaps moving west or east again, or trying a different direction. 

Also, the inventory shows the agent has a katana, yumi (bow), and quiver. Maybe using the bow could help clear paths, but since the previous actions were movement, maybe sticking to moving towards the boulder's position is better. 

Considering the map's layout, the agent might need to navigate around the dark areas and bars to get to the boulder. If the boulder is stuck because of a wall, the agent needs to find a way around to push it. For example, if the boulder is south of the agent, pushing it north might be possible if there's space. 

Alternatively, maybe the boulder needs to be moved from northnorthwest to westnorthwest. The agent could move west towards the boulder's position and then push it north or west. But the current position is (37,13), and the boulder is at northnorthwest, which might be to the northwest direction from there. 

Wait, the cursor position is (37,13), and the boulder is very near northnorthwest. So, moving northwest would take the agent closer. But movement directions are only north, south, east, west. So, to go northwest, the agent would need to move north then west, or west then north. 

Alternatively, maybe the boulder is adjacent to the agent. The latest observation says the boulder is adjacent northeast and south. Wait, the agent is at (37,13), and the boulder is adjacent northeast and south. So, the boulder is to the northeast (which would be (38,14)) and south (36,13). 

But the agent is at (37,13). So, if the boulder is to the south at (36,13), the agent could try pushing it north by moving north into it. But the previous attempt to move the boulder north failed, which might mean there's something blocking the path north of the boulder. Maybe a wall or another obstacle. 

In that case, the agent needs to find a way around. If the boulder is at (36,13), and pushing north is blocked, maybe the agent can move west or east to get around and then push the boulder in the desired direction. 

Alternatively, the other boulder is at westsouthwest, which might be another target. But the fountains are at southsouthwest and westnorthwest. So, perhaps both boulders need to be moved there. 

But the current focus is on the boulder adjacent to the agent. Since pushing north failed, maybe moving east or west to create space. If the agent moves east to (38,13), then perhaps they can push the boulder south into the fountain at southsouthwest. 

Alternatively, moving west to (36,13) and then pushing the boulder east. But the agent's current position is (37,13), so moving west would take them to (36,13), which is where the boulder's south side is. If they move west into (36,13), which has the boulder, they might push it east. 

Wait, in the language observation, the boulder is adjacent northeast and south. So, the boulder's position relative to the agent (37,13) would be: northeast is (38,14), and south is (37,12). Wait, no—adjacent directions: north would be (37,12), south (37,14), east (38,13), west (36,13). But the message says the boulder is adjacent northeast and south. So, northeast would be (38,14), and south is (37,14). But the agent's current position is (37,13). 

Wait, maybe the boulder is at (37,14) (south of agent) and (38,14) (northeast of agent). So, the agent is at (37,13), and the boulder is south at (37,14) and northeast at (38,14). But how can a boulder be adjacent in both directions? Unless it's at a corner. 

This is a bit confusing. Let me try to visualize. The agent is at (37,13). Adjacent squares are north (37,12), south (37,14), east (38,13), west (36,13). The boulder is adjacent northeast and south. So, northeast would be (38,14), and south is (37,14). Therefore, the boulder is at (38,14) and (37,14). That would mean the boulder is stretching from (37,14) to (38,14), but that's impossible because boulders are single tiles. Maybe the description means the boulder is in the northeast direction (38,14) and also to the south (37,14), implying it's a corner placement. 

In any case, the agent needs to push the boulder. Since pushing north from (37,13) into the boulder at (38,14) would require moving the boulder to (39,15), but that failed before. Maybe there's a wall there. Alternatively, pushing the boulder south from (37,13) into (37,14), which is where the boulder is currently. Wait, that doesn't make sense. If the agent is at (37,13) and the boulder is at (37,14) (south), then moving south would step on the boulder, pushing it to (37,15). But the message said trying to move the boulder south failed. Maybe (37,15) is blocked. 

Alternatively, the agent needs to move around to the side of the boulder to push it in the desired direction. For example, if the boulder is at (38,14) (northeast), the agent could move east to (38,13) and then push the boulder north to (39,14), but that might be blocked. 

Another possibility is that the agent needs to move the other boulder at westsouthwest towards the fountain at westnorthwest. To do that, the agent would have to navigate to that area, which is to the west and north. From (37,13), moving west multiple times and then north could reach that region. 

But considering the previous actions, the agent has been moving around this area without success. Maybe the best approach is to try a different direction. Since the last attempt to move south failed, perhaps moving west or east to get a better angle on the boulder. 

Alternatively, the agent could try pushing the boulder to the west. If the boulder is at (38,14), pushing it west would take it to (37,14), which is adjacent to the agent. Then, the agent could push it further west. But the message said pushing north or south failed, so maybe pushing west is possible. 

Wait, the agent is at (37,13). If the boulder is at (38,14), moving west to (36,13) wouldn't help. To push the boulder west, the agent would need to be to the east of the boulder. So, the agent should move east to (38,13), then push the boulder west to (37,14). But the boulder is already at (38,14), so moving east into it would push it west. 

Yes, that makes sense. So, the agent should move east to (38,13), then push the boulder west into (37,14). If that's possible, then the boulder would move towards the fountain at southsouthwest, which is at (37,15) perhaps. 

But need to check if there's a wall blocking that path. The map's layout isn't clear, but based on previous observations, there are dark areas and bars which might be walls. If moving east is possible, then that's the way to go. 

So, the next action should be to move east towards the boulder, then push it west. Since the last action was south and failed, moving east seems like a logical next step to position oneself to push the boulder west.

Let's try to figure out what the best move is here. The agent is in a Boxoban-like game and needs to push boulders onto fountains. Let's look at the current state.

The player is at position (38, 13). The map shows some bars and dark areas, but the key elements are the boulders and fountains. From the language observation, there's a boulder near westsouthwest and another very near northwest. The fountains are near westnorthwest and southwest. The agent just moved east to (38,13), so they're now next to the boulder at (37,13) based on previous movements.

The goal is to push the boulder onto a fountain. The adjacent boulder to the east (current position) might need to be moved towards the fountain in the southwest. Looking at the map, the fountain is adjacent to the west, which is the direction the agent is facing. So pushing the boulder west into the fountain would solve that. But the message history shows that sometimes moving a boulder fails if there's no space behind it. Let's check the last observation: after moving east, the boulder is adjacent northeast and south. Wait, the agent is at (38,13), so the boulder to the west (37,13) would be adjacent to the agent's east. To push it west, the agent needs to move west into it, which would push the boulder west. But we need to check if there's space behind the boulder. The observation mentions the boulder adjacent northeast and south. If the boulder at (37,13) has space to the west (which is the agent's current position's west, so (36,13)), then pushing it west would work. 

Looking at the map, the cursor is at (38,13) with the boulder at (37,13). The agent needs to move west into the boulder to push it west to (36,13). Then, if there's a fountain there, that would be good. The language observation mentions a fountain adjacent west, which would be at (38,12) maybe? Wait, the fountain very near southwest. The agent's current position is (38,13). Southwest would be (37,12). Not sure. Alternatively, the fountain near westnorthwest might be at (36,14) or similar. Maybe the best approach is to push the boulder west towards the fountain. 

The previous attempts show that moving north or south against the boulder didn't work, so the best bet is to try pushing it west. So the action should be west again to push the boulder. Let's confirm: agent is at (38,13), boulder at (37,13). Move west into the boulder, which would push it to (36,13). If there's a fountain there, that's the solution. The language observation says the boulder is very near northwest, which might be the direction after moving. So the action is west.

32,south,"<reasoning>
Let's see. The current situation is in Boxoban, which is a Sokoban-like game. My goal is to push all the boulders onto the fountains. From the observations, there are two boulders, and the fountains are in specific positions. I need to figure out the best path to move the boulders correctly.

Looking at the map, the agent (samurai) is at position (37,13). There's a boulder adjacent to the northeast and south. The fountains are near the south and west. The stairs are up near eastsoutheast, which might be a way out once all boulders are placed, but the immediate goal is to place the boulders on fountains.

First, the boulder to the northeast (probably at (38,13)) and the one to the south (maybe (37,14)). The fountains are near south and west. The north boulder is adjacent, but moving it north might not help. Let's check the surroundings.

The agent tried moving east and west a lot, but the boulder won't move when trying to push north or south. That suggests that pushing the boulder east or west might be possible. Wait, the last successful push was moving the boulder east to (37,12) previously? Or maybe in an earlier step.

Looking at the latest move, the agent moved east to (37,13) after pushing the boulder east earlier. Now, the boulder is at (37,12) or maybe another position. Wait, the observation after pushing the boulder east says the agent is at (37,12), but then subsequent moves might have changed that.

Wait, the last successful move was ""east"" which resulted in the message ""With great effort you move the boulder."" That would have moved the boulder one step east. So the boulder is now at (38,12) perhaps? Or maybe (37,12) if the agent moved. Wait, in the game, when you push a boulder, both the agent and the boulder move. So moving east would take the agent to (38,13) and the boulder to (38,12).

But in the current observation, after that move, the agent is at (37,13) again. Hmm, maybe there's confusion in the coordinates. The cursor position is (37,13), and the boulder is adjacent northeast (so (38,13)) and south (37,14). Wait, the latest message after pushing east said the agent is at (37,13), which suggests that maybe the boulder was already there, and pushing it east would take it to (38,13). But the cursor is back at (37,13), which might mean the boulder is now at (38,13).

But in the current observation, the boulder adjacent northeast. So if the agent is at (37,13), the boulder northeast would be (38,13). That makes sense. So the boulder is now at (38,13), and the agent is trying to move further east, but perhaps there's a wall or another obstacle.

The fountains are near south (so maybe at (37,14) or (38,14)) and west (perhaps at (36,13)). So the boulder at (38,13) is adjacent to a fountain to the south (if the fountain is at (38,14)), but the agent needs to push it there. However, moving the boulder south would require the agent to position themselves to push it.

Alternatively, the other boulder is south of the agent, at (37,14). If that's on a fountain, then that's good, but the observation doesn't specify which boulders are on fountains. The message ""fountain adjacent west"" suggests there's a fountain to the west of the agent's current position, which is (37,13) west to (36,13). So maybe the boulder at (36,13) is on a fountain?

Wait, the language observation mentions ""fountain adjacent west"" which would be (36,13). If there's a boulder there, then it's already on a fountain. But the observation also says ""boulder adjacent northeast and south"", which are (38,13) and (37,14). The other boulder might be the one at (38,13), and the one at (37,14). If one of them is on a fountain, then the task is to get the other one there.

The goal is to have both boulders on fountains. So need to check which fountains have boulders. The fountains are near south and west. The west fountain is at (36,13), which is adjacent to the agent's current position. If there's a boulder there, it's already placed. The other fountain is near south, perhaps at (37,14) or (38,14).

The agent needs to move the boulder at (38,13) south to (38,14) which is a fountain. To do that, the agent needs to position themselves to the west of the boulder so they can push it south. The agent is currently at (37,13). If they move east to (38,13), they can then push the boulder south to (38,14), which is a fountain. That would solve one boulder. Then the other boulder at (37,14) needs to be checked if it's on a fountain. If not, the agent would need to move it there.

Alternatively, the boulder at (37,14) might already be on a fountain. The observation says ""fountain adjacent west"", which is (36,13), and ""fountain near south"", which might be (37,14). If the boulder at (37,14) is there, then both are placed, and the game is won.

Wait, the observation's language description says ""fountain adjacent west"" (so (36,13)) and ""fountain near south"" (could be (37,14) or (38,14)). The boulder adjacent south is at (37,14). If that's on the fountain at (37,14), then that's one down. The other boulder at (38,13) needs to be pushed to (38,14) which is a fountain.

So the next step is to move the agent to the position where they can push the boulder at (38,13) south. To do that, the agent needs to be to the west of the boulder. The agent is currently at (37,13). Moving east to (38,13) would allow them to face the boulder and push it south. So the action should be ""east"".

But in the previous moves, moving east from (37,13) was attempted, but the message said ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" That might be because the boulder is already pushed as far as it can go, or there's an obstacle. Wait, the latest successful push was moving the boulder east to (38,12), but maybe the current position has the boulder at (38,13), and pushing it further east is blocked.

Alternatively, maybe the agent is trying to push the boulder north or south when it's already in a position. The agent needs to find a way to push the boulder towards the southern fountain.

Another possibility is that the boulder at (38,13) is adjacent to a wall, preventing it from being pushed further east. In that case, the agent should try pushing it south to (38,14), which is a fountain. To do that, the agent needs to move south to (37,14), then push west into the boulder. Wait, no. If the agent is at (37,13), they can move east to (38,13) and then push south.

But the previous attempt to move east resulted in a message saying the boulder couldn't be moved. Maybe there's an obstacle in the way. Looking at the map, there are a lot of '#' which are walls. The map shows ########## in several rows, which are walls. The agent's position is somewhere in this grid. The boulder at (38,13) might be next to a wall, preventing it from being pushed east. Therefore, the agent should try pushing it south instead.

So the plan is:

1. Move the agent to (38,13) by going east.
2. Push the boulder at (38,13) south to (38,14), which is a fountain.

But if moving east is not possible (due to the boulder being blocked), the agent should check other directions. Alternatively, maybe the boulder is already pushed as far east as possible, and needs to be moved south.

Alternatively, the other boulder at (37,14) is on a fountain. If that's the case, then only the boulder at (38,13) needs to be moved. But how to confirm?

The language observation mentions ""fountain adjacent west"" (so (36,13)) and ""fountain very near south"" (could be (37,14) or (38,14)). The boulder adjacent south is at (37,14). If that's on the fountain at (37,14), then that's one done. The other boulder at (38,13) needs to be moved south to (38,14).

Assuming that's the case, the agent needs to push the boulder at (38,13) south. To do that, the agent must be positioned to the west of the boulder. So the agent should move east to (38,13), then push south.

But the previous attempt to move east resulted in a message that the boulder couldn't be moved. That might be because there's a wall or another obstacle to the east of the boulder. Looking at the map, the agent's position is at (37,13), and the map has a lot of walls (##########). Maybe the boulder at (38,13) is against a wall, preventing it from being pushed further east. Therefore, the agent should try pushing it south instead.

So the next action is to move south to (37,14), which is where the boulder is adjacent. Then, push the boulder west or south. Wait, if the agent is at (37,13) and moves south to (37,14), they are now adjacent to the boulder at (37,14). Then, they can try pushing the boulder west or north. But the goal is to get it to the fountain at (38,14), so pushing it east from (37,14) to (38,14). But that would require the agent to be at (37,14) and push east. However, the boulder is already at (37,14), so the agent would need to move into it to push.

Alternatively, the agent is at (37,13), moves south to (37,14), now adjacent to the boulder at (37,14). Then, they can try pushing the boulder east to (38,14), which is a fountain. That would solve the problem.

So the sequence would be:

1. Move south to (37,14).
2. Push the boulder east to (38,14).

But in the current observation, the agent is at (37,13), and the boulder is adjacent south (37,14). So moving south to (37,14) would allow the agent to push the boulder east.

However, the previous attempts to move south resulted in the message ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" That might be because the boulder is already at (37,14), and the agent is trying to push it further south, which is blocked by a wall or another obstacle.

Looking at the map, the agent is in a grid with walls around. The map shows several rows of ##########, which are walls. The agent's position is somewhere in the middle. The boulder at (37,14) might be against a wall, preventing it from being pushed further south. Therefore, pushing it east to (38,14) might be possible if that direction is not blocked.

In the current observation, the boulder at (37,14) is adjacent south. If moving it east is possible, then that's the way to go. The agent needs to move to (37,14) and push east.

So the next action should be ""south"" to move to (37,14), then ""east"" to push the boulder to (38,14).

But the previous attempt to move south resulted in the message saying the boulder couldn't be moved. That suggests that there's an obstacle in the way. Perhaps the boulder at (37,14) is against a wall to the south, so pushing it further south isn't possible, but pushing east might be.

Alternatively, maybe the agent is not positioned correctly. To push the boulder east, the agent needs to be to the west of it. So the agent should move east to (38,13), then push south. But if moving east isn't possible, then moving south and then east is the alternative.

Given the confusion in the map layout and the observations, the safest bet is to try moving the agent closer to the target boulder and attempt to push it towards the fountain. Given the previous attempts, the agent might need to adjust their position.

Considering the current position (37,13) and the boulder to the northeast (38,13) and south (37,14), the immediate next step is to try pushing the boulder at (38,13) south. To do that, the agent needs to be at (38,13). So moving east again.

But earlier attempts to move east resulted in the boulder not moving, possibly because it's blocked. Maybe there's a wall to the east of the boulder at (38,13). In that case, the agent should try moving the other boulder.

Alternatively, the agent should check the other boulder at (37,14). If that's on a fountain, then the game is won. The observation mentions ""fountain adjacent west"" (36,13), so if there's a boulder there, it's placed. The other boulder at (37,14) would need to be on the fountain at (37,14) or (38,14).

Assuming the boulder at (37,14) is on the fountain, then the only task is to get the boulder at (38,13) to (38,14). To do that, the agent needs to move east to (38,13) and push south.

But since previous attempts to move east didn't work, maybe there's a different approach. The agent could try moving north, but that area might be blocked. Alternatively, move west to (36,13), which is near a fountain. If there's a boulder there, it's already placed.

In the current observation, the boulder adjacent northeast is at (38,13), and the one adjacent south is at (37,14). The agent is at (37,13). The only unplaced boulder would be the one at (38,13), needing to go to (38,14).

To push it there, the agent must be to the west of the boulder. So move east to (38,13), then push south.

But the previous attempt to move east resulted in the message that the boulder couldn't be moved. That suggests that there's an obstacle in the way. Looking at the map, perhaps there's a wall at (38,13) east, blocking the boulder's path. In that case, pushing it east isn't possible, but pushing it south might be.

So the agent should move south to (37,14), then try to push the boulder east to (38,14). Let's see:

1. Move south from (37,13) to (37,14).
2. Push the boulder at (37,14) east to (38,14).

This would place the boulder on the fountain at (38,14). If that's successful, both boulders would be on fountains, completing the level.

The only issue is whether there's a wall at (38,14). Given the map's walls (##########), it's possible that (38,14) is a valid position. If the agent can push the boulder there, then that's the solution.

Therefore, the next action should be ""south"" to move to (37,14), then ""east"" to push the boulder. However, the agent needs to choose one action at a time. Since the last message after moving east was that the boulder couldn't be moved, perhaps moving south first is the way to go.

So the chosen action is ""south"".

Let's see. The agent is stuck trying to move a boulder but can't because there's something blocking it. The previous actions kept going back and forth between east and west, north and south. The last few attempts to push the boulder resulted in ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" So the agent is right next to the boulder but can't push it.

Looking at the map, the agent's position is (37,13). The boulder is adjacent to northeast and south. The cursor shows the agent as @, and the boulder might be represented by a '{' or another symbol. The map shows some structures with '#' and possibly the boulder nearby.

The key here is to figure out the direction of the boulder relative to the agent. Since the boulder is adjacent northeast and south, maybe the agent needs to move in a direction that allows pushing the boulder away. For example, if the boulder is to the northeast, the agent might need to move north or west to have space to push it east or south. Alternatively, if the boulder is blocking the south, pushing it south would require the agent to be positioned so that pushing it doesn't hit a wall or another obstacle.

The language observation mentions bars and dark areas, which might be walls or obstacles. The stairs up are near eastsoutheast, but the current focus is on moving the boulder. The agent needs to find an open space behind the boulder to push it towards a fountain. 

Since the agent tried moving south multiple times without success, perhaps the boulder is against a wall or another obstacle to the south. In that case, the agent should try pushing it in another direction, like east or northeast. But the previous attempts to move east or north didn't work because the boulder is stuck. 

Wait, the message says ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" So the agent is already next to it but can't push. That usually means there's something blocking the boulder's path. The agent needs to check where the boulder is going to be pushed. If pushing east, is there a space? Or maybe the agent needs to reposition themselves to have a clear path.

Looking at the cursor position, the agent is at (37,13). The boulder is adjacent northeast and south. So the boulder is either at (38,13) (east) and (37,14) (south), or maybe other coordinates. If the agent is trying to push it south to a fountain, but the south direction is blocked by a wall or another boulder, that's why it's not moving.

The map shows some structures with '#', which are walls. So the agent might need to find a way around the walls to position the boulder over a fountain. Alternatively, the fountains are in specific locations indicated by 'f' in the language observation. The fountain is near southsoutheast and west. So maybe the boulder needs to be pushed to the southeast or west.

Given that the agent is at (37,13), pushing the boulder east to (38,13) might be possible if there's space behind it. But the previous attempts to move east didn't work because the boulder is stuck. Let me check the latest map. The map shows at position (37,13) the agent's '@', and to the east there's a '<' which might be a door or a feature. The boulder is represented by '{' perhaps. Looking at the map line:

#..{@..<## 

So in row 6 (assuming y=12 is the sixth line?), the agent is at position 37, which might correspond to the '@' in that line. The '<' is to the east, which could be a door or a direction to proceed. The boulder '{' is nearby. If the agent tries to push the boulder east towards the '<', maybe there's a path. But the message says vain, so perhaps the '<' is a wall or another obstacle.

Alternatively, the agent should try moving north or west to create space. But the agent has already tried moving north and found it impossible. Maybe the solution is to reposition the agent to the west or north-west so that when they push the boulder, it can move without obstruction.

Another angle: the fountains are near southsoutheast and west. The agent's current position is (37,13). To push the boulder to the west, towards the fountain adjacent west, the agent would need to be adjacent to the boulder and push it west. But if the boulder is already adjacent west, maybe the agent needs to be to the west of the boulder to push it further west. However, the agent's current position is east of the boulder.

Wait, the cursor shows the agent at (37,13), and the boulder adjacent northeast (so maybe (38,13) or (37,12)) and south (37,14). If the boulder is at (38,13) (east), pushing it east would require being next to it and having space east of that. But the '<' is at (38,13), which might be a door or a feature that's not passable. So pushing the boulder east into the '<' would be impossible.

Alternatively, if the boulder is at (37,14) (south), pushing it south would require space beyond that. But the agent tried south and it didn't work. So maybe the boulder is blocked by a wall or another obstacle there.

Given that the agent can't push the boulder in the attempted directions, the next step is to try a different direction. Maybe push the boulder north or west. But the agent was trying south and east before. Let's check the language observation again. The boulder is adjacent northeast and south. So the agent is to the northwest of the boulder? Or northeast? Wait, the agent is at (37,13). If the boulder is adjacent northeast, that would be (38,12) or (38,13). If it's adjacent south, that's (37,14). So the boulder is to the east and south of the agent. 

To push the boulder east, the agent needs to be to the northwest of it. But the agent is already east of the boulder's north position. Hmm, maybe the agent should move west to be next to the boulder's west side, then push it east. But the agent tried moving west and east repeatedly. 

Alternatively, perhaps the boulder is stuck against a wall. The map has a lot of '#' which are walls. If the boulder is against a wall to the south, pushing it south won't work. The agent needs to push it in another direction where there's space. For example, pushing it east into an open area. But the '<' at (38,13) might be a wall or a door that's not passable. 

The key is to find a direction where the boulder can be pushed without hitting a wall or another obstacle. Since the agent can't push it south or east, maybe trying to push it north or west. If the boulder is at (38,13) (east), pushing it north would require the agent to be at (38,12) and push it to (38,11), but the agent is at (37,13). So the agent would need to move north to (37,12) and then push the boulder east to (38,12). But the agent's current position is (37,13). 

Alternatively, the agent could move north to (37,12), then try to push the boulder east. But the previous attempts to move north resulted in messages about no change. Maybe moving north is blocked. 

Another possibility: the agent needs to look for a fountain in a different direction. The fountain is adjacent west, so maybe pushing the boulder west into that fountain. But the boulder is currently adjacent northeast and south. If the agent can push it west, that would align it with the west fountain. To do that, the agent would need to be to the east of the boulder and push it west. But the agent is already east of the boulder's east side. 

Wait, maybe the agent is next to the boulder's north side. If the boulder is at (37,14) (south of agent), then pushing it south is blocked. But if the agent moves west to (36,13) and then tries to push the boulder east, that could work if there's space. But the agent tried moving west and east multiple times. 

The answer seems to be that the agent needs to find a way to position themselves so that pushing the boulder in a valid direction is possible. Given the current observations and the fact that previous pushes failed, the next logical step is to try a different direction, perhaps north or west, to see if there's an open path. Alternatively, check if there's a fountain in another direction that the boulder can be pushed towards.

",-0.001,False
34,west,"<reasoning>
Let's see where I am. The agent (me) is at position (37, 13). There's a boulder nearby, and the goal is to push it onto a fountain. From the observations, there's a fountain adjacent to the west. The previous attempts to move the boulder north or south didn't work because maybe there's something blocking the way or the boulder is stuck.

Looking at the map, the cursor shows the agent's position with an @ symbol. The boulder is adjacent to the northeast and south. The fountain is to the west. So maybe I need to position myself to push the boulder towards the west. But how? The boulder is south and northeast of me. If I move west, perhaps I can get behind the boulder and push it south-west towards the fountain.

Wait, the agent is at (37,13). The boulder is adjacent northeast (so maybe (38,12) or similar) and south (38,13). The fountain is west, so (36,13). So the boulder is to the east and south. To push it west towards the fountain, I need to be to the north or east of the boulder. But currently, the agent is east of the boulder. Maybe moving west once and then trying to push the boulder south-west?

But earlier attempts to move south when adjacent didn't work. Maybe the direction needs to be precise. Let me check the last messages: ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" That suggests that the previous action was directed towards the boulder but failed. Maybe the boulder is blocked by another obstacle or the agent isn't positioned correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the boulder is adjacent in a direction that's not allowing movement. For example, if the boulder is to the south, pushing it south would require being to the north of it. But the agent is east of the boulder's position. Maybe the agent needs to move south to get to the north of the boulder, then push it south towards the fountain.

Wait, the boulder's south adjacent. So if the agent is at (37,13), and the boulder is south at (37,14), then to push it south, the agent would need to be north of it, at (37,13). But the agent is already there. Hmm, maybe the boulder is at (38,13), south of the agent. Then pushing it south would require being to the north of it. But the agent is at (37,13), so the boulder would be at (38,13). To push it south, the agent needs to move to (38,12) and then push. But maybe there's a wall or another obstacle there.

Looking at the map, there are a lot of ########## which might represent walls or obstacles. The map is mostly filled with those, so the agent can't go through them. The agent's position is near the center of a grid that's mostly walls. The boulder is in a corridor perhaps. The fountain is to the west, so maybe the agent needs to navigate around the obstacles to get to a position where they can push the boulder towards the fountain.

Alternatively, since the boulder was moved earlier once when the agent went east, maybe pushing it again in a different direction. The previous successful move was east, so perhaps pushing it further east isn't helpful. The fountain is west, so maybe pushing the boulder west would be better. To do that, the agent needs to be to the east of the boulder. If the boulder is at (38,13), then the agent is at (37,13). To push it west, the agent needs to move west to (36,13) and then push west. But is that possible?

Wait, the boulder is adjacent northeast and south. If the agent is at (37,13), and the boulder is at (38,12) (northeast), then pushing it west would require the agent to be north of the boulder. But the agent is east. Maybe the boulder is at (38,13) south of the agent. Then to push it west, the agent would need to be north of it. But the agent is already north. Hmm, maybe the boulder is blocked by something, preventing movement. The message says ""in vain"" when trying to move it, so perhaps there's an obstacle behind the boulder.

In that case, the agent might need to move around the boulder to a position where they can push it in the desired direction without obstacles blocking. Since the fountain is west, maybe pushing the boulder west-southwest. To do that, the agent could move south to get to the south side of the boulder and then push west. But if moving south is blocked, that might not work.

Alternatively, check the adjacent cells. The boulder has fountains adjacent to the west. So if the boulder is near a fountain, pushing it onto it would solve the problem. The cursor's message shows ""fountain adjacent west"", so maybe the boulder is near a fountain to the west. If the agent can push the boulder west into the fountain, that's the solution.

Given the agent's current position at (37,13), and the boulder adjacent south (38,13), the fountain is at (36,13). To push the boulder west into the fountain, the agent needs to be north of the boulder. But the agent is east. So the agent should move south to (37,14), then west to (36,14), then push the boulder west to (36,13), which is the fountain. However, there might be walls blocking this path.

Looking at the map, the map has a lot of '#' which are walls. The agent's current position is in a corridor that's probably surrounded by walls. The only way to move is along the corridors. The previous moves east and west suggest that there's a corridor in the east-west direction. Maybe the boulder is in a corridor that's two cells wide.

Given the uncertainty in the map layout, perhaps the best approach is to keep trying to push the boulder in different directions, preferably towards the fountain. Since the last successful push was east, maybe pushing it again in another direction. Alternatively, move the agent to a position where they can push the boulder west.

Considering the agent is at (37,13), and the boulder is at (38,13) south, pushing it west would require the agent to be north of it. But the agent is east. So the agent needs to move south to (37,14), then west to (36,14), then maybe north or south to get into a position to push west. Alternatively, move west to (36,13) which is the fountain's position, but that's where the boulder needs to go. If the agent can get behind the boulder, they can push it.

Another possibility: since the boulder is adjacent south, the agent can try to push it south again, but that didn't work before. Maybe the path is blocked. Alternatively, push it southwest, which would be towards the fountain. To push southwest, the agent needs to be to the northeast of the boulder. If the boulder is at (38,13), then northeast would be (37,12). The agent is at (37,13), so moving north to (37,12) and then pushing southwest. But is that possible?

Wait, pushing a boulder in a diagonal direction requires that the cell diagonally behind is unoccupied. So if the agent is at (37,12), and the boulder is at (38,13), pushing southwest would require the cell (37,13) to be unoccupied. But the agent is there. Hmm, that might not work.

Alternatively, the agent can move to (38,12), which is northeast of the boulder, then push southwest into (37,13), which is the agent's current position. But that would move the boulder into the agent's position, which might not be allowed.

This is getting complicated. Maybe the best approach is to keep trying to push the boulder in the direction of the fountain, which is west. To do that, the agent needs to get to the west side of the boulder. Since the boulder is adjacent south, the agent can move south to (37,14), then west to (36,14), then push the boulder west to (36,13), which is the fountain. But need to check if those moves are possible.

Looking at the map, the cells to the south of the agent (37,13) might be passable. The map's structure isn't fully visible, but the agent has moved south before without issues. If moving south to (37,14) is possible, then the agent can proceed west from there. However, the previous attempts to move south when adjacent to the boulder resulted in failure, possibly because the path is blocked.

Alternatively, maybe the agent should try to push the boulder north. If the boulder is at (38,13), pushing it north to (38,12) could create space to then push it west. But again, depends on the map layout.

Given the uncertainty, perhaps the safest action is to continue trying to push the boulder in the direction of the fountain, which is west. So the agent should move west to (36,13) and attempt to push the boulder west into the fountain. However, the boulder is currently south of the agent. To push it west, the agent would need to be north of the boulder. Since the agent is east, moving west once gets them to (36,13), which is west of their current position, but not north of the boulder. 

Wait, the boulder is at (38,13) south of the agent. If the agent moves west to (36,13), that's directly west, but the boulder is at (38,13). So the agent is two cells west of the boulder. To push the boulder west, the agent would need to be north of it. This seems tricky.

Another angle: the agent previously successfully pushed the boulder east. Maybe pushing it east again, but that's away from the fountain. Not helpful. Alternatively, after moving east once, the boulder is at (38,13). Now, to push it west, the agent needs to be north of it. So move north to (37,12), then push west. But is that cell passable?

The map shows a lot of ##########, which are likely walls. The agent's position is in a corridor, so moving north might hit a wall. The cursor's position is (37,13), and the map's row 12 (assuming y=12 is the first row) has a lot of `#`. So moving north to y=11 might be a wall. 

Given that, maybe the agent can't move north. Then, the best bet is to try pushing the boulder south again, but that didn't work. Alternatively, move the agent to the south of the boulder and push it south-west into the fountain.

Wait, the boulder is at (38,13). If the agent moves to (38,14), then they can push the boulder south-west to (37,13), which is the agent's current position. That would swap their positions, but not move the boulder towards the fountain. Not helpful.

Alternatively, the agent could move south to (37,14), then west to (36,14), then try to push the boulder west from there. But again, depends on the map's obstacles.

At this point, considering the previous attempts and the lack of progress, perhaps the best action is to try pushing the boulder in a different direction, such as west, even if it means moving the agent around. So the agent should move west to (36,13) and attempt to push the boulder west into the fountain at (36,13). However, since the boulder is at (38,13), the agent would need to be north of it to push west. Moving west to (36,13) doesn't place the agent north of the boulder. 

This is quite challenging. Maybe the agent needs to reposition themselves. Let's think: the boulder is at (38,13). The fountain is at (36,13). The agent is at (37,13). To push the boulder west, the agent needs to be at (38,12), north of the boulder. So the agent should move north to (37,12), then east to (38,12), and then push west into (37,13), which is where the agent is. That would move the boulder to (38,13), but the agent is already there. Not helpful.

Alternatively, the agent could move south to (37,14), then east to (38,14), then push the boulder north into (38,13), but that's where it already is. 

Hmm. Maybe the only way is to keep pushing the boulder in the direction of the fountain, even if it's not working. Since the last successful push was east, perhaps pushing it again in another direction. But all directions have been tried. 

Wait, the boulder has fountains adjacent to the west. So the agent should push it west into the fountain. To do that, the agent needs to be to the east of the boulder. The boulder is at (38,13), so the agent needs to be at (37,13) to push west. But the agent is already there. Pushing west from (37,13) would move the boulder to (37,12), but that's north of the agent's current position. Not towards the fountain.

Wait, the fountain is at (36,13). So pushing the boulder from (38,13) to (37,13) would move it one step west, closer to the fountain. Then the agent can push it again from (37,13) to (36,13), which is the fountain. 

Let me try that. The agent is at (37,13). The boulder is at (38,13). If the agent pushes the boulder west, it would move to (38,12). But that's north of the agent. Not helpful. Wait, no. To push the boulder west, the agent needs to be north of it. So the agent should move to (38,12), then push west to (37,12). But the agent is at (37,13). To get to (38,12), the agent needs to move south to (37,14), then east to (38,14), then north to (38,12). That's a detour. 

Alternatively, the agent can move south to (37,14), then west to (36,14), then push the boulder west from there. But the boulder is at (38,13), so pushing west from (36,14) would require the agent to be north of the boulder. 

This is getting too complicated. Perhaps the best action now is to move the agent to the position where they can push the boulder west into the fountain. Given the current position, the agent is at (37,13). The boulder is at (38,13). To push it west into (36,13), the agent needs to move to (38,12) and push west. But getting there requires navigating around walls. 

Alternatively, the agent can try to move the boulder north. If the boulder is at (38,13), pushing it north to (38,12) might create a path. Then the agent can move north and push it again. 

But without knowing the map's exact layout, it's hard to say. Given the previous attempts and the lack of progress, perhaps the best action is to continue trying to push the boulder in the direction of the fountain, even if it's not working, as per the game's mechanics. So the agent should try to push the boulder west again from their current position.

Wait, the agent is at (37,13), and the boulder is at (38,13) south. To push the boulder west, the agent needs to be north of it. So the agent should move south to (37,14), then west to (36,14), then push the boulder west. But how?

Alternatively, the agent can move west to (36,13), which is the fountain's position, and then push the boulder west from there. But the boulder is at (38,13), so the agent would need to be at (37,13) to push it. 

I'm stuck. Maybe the solution is to move the agent south to get behind the boulder and then push it west. So the agent moves south to (37,14), then west to (36,14), then north to (36,13), and then push the boulder west. 

But given the uncertainty, the safest action is to try pushing the boulder west again, even if it failed before. The agent is at (37,13), boulder at (38,13). Action: south, then west, then push west. But the user requires only one action per step. 

Given the latest observation, the agent is at (37,13), and the boulder is adjacent south. The message says pushing the boulder in vain, so previous action was probably pushing south. To try a different direction, maybe push west. 

Wait, pushing west from (37,13) would require the boulder to be north of the agent. But the boulder is south. So that's not possible. 

Alternatively, push the boulder south. But the agent already tried that. 

Hmm. Maybe the agent needs to move around the boulder. For example, move south to (37,14), then west to (36,14), then north to (36,13), which is the fountain. Then, from there, push the boulder west. But the boulder is at (38,13), so the agent would need to be at (37,13) to push it. 

This is really tricky. Given the time I've spent, I'll choose to move west again, hoping that the previous blocking condition has changed. So the action is west.

",-0.001,False
35,south,"<reasoning>
Let's try to figure out what to do next in this Boxoban-like game. The goal is to push all the boulders onto the fountains. Looking at the current state, the player is at (36, 13) and there's a boulder adjacent to the northeast. The latest observation shows that moving south or trying to push the boulder again in vain didn't work. The map has several bars and dark areas, but the key elements are the boulders and fountains.

First, I need to check the positions of the boulders and fountains. From the language observations, there's a fountain very near the southeast and another adjacent to the west. The boulders are very near east, eastsoutheast, and south. Also, there's a boulder adjacent northeast, which is probably near the player's current position.

The player just moved west to (36, 13) after trying to push a boulder to the east, which didn't work. The message says ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain,"" which means the boulder is either blocked by something or the player isn't positioned correctly to push it.

Looking at the map, there's a '<' symbol near the southeast, which might be a goal or a fountain. The player needs to navigate to push the boulder towards that direction. Since the player is facing east (based on previous moves), maybe they need to turn south or north to reposition. 

Another observation mentions stairs up near eastsoutheast, but the priority is pushing boulders. The current boulder adjacent northeast could be the one to focus on. If the player moves east again, they might be able to push it south towards the fountain. Alternatively, moving south might allow accessing another area where the boulder can be pushed.

Wait, the latest move was west to (36,13), and the boulder adjacent northeast is now at (37,12) perhaps? If the player moves east again to (37,13), they might be next to the boulder and can try pushing it south into the fountain. But earlier attempts to push resulted in ""in vain,"" so maybe the direction is wrong. 

Alternatively, the player could move south to (36,14) and see if there's a clear path to push the boulder east or west. The map shows some bars and dark areas, which might be walls or obstacles. The key is to find a path where the boulder can be moved towards the nearest fountain, which is southeast. 

Considering the previous actions, the player has been moving east and west, trying to navigate around obstacles. The most recent successful move was pushing the boulder east, so maybe continuing in that direction would help. However, the player is now at (37,13) and the boulder adjacent northeast, so moving east again to (38,13) might allow pushing the boulder south into the fountain at southeast.

But the last attempt to move south resulted in failure, so perhaps the boulder is blocked by another obstacle. The player needs to check the surrounding tiles for walls or other boulders. Since the map shows 'bars' which could be walls, the player must avoid those. 

Another approach is to move the player to a position where they can push the boulder in the correct direction. For example, if the boulder is to the northeast, moving north or east might allow a push south or west. But given the player's current position, moving east again and then south could create a path. 

Alternatively, the player could try moving south to (36,14) and then east to see if there's a way to reposition. However, the dark areas and bars might be blocking that. The priority is to get the boulder onto the fountain at southeast. The fountain is very near southsoutheast, so pushing the boulder in that direction would be ideal. 

Given the previous attempts, the best next step might be to move south again to see if there's a clear path or to adjust the player's position for a successful push. Alternatively, moving east to (37,13) and then south to (37,14) could provide a new angle to push the boulder. 

But the last message when moving south was ""in vain,"" so maybe the boulder is against a wall. In that case, the player needs to find another way around. Perhaps moving west to (36,13) and then north to (36,12) to reposition. 

Wait, the current cursor is at (36,13), so moving north would take the player to (36,12). Let me check the map again. The map shows some symbols like '#' which are walls, '.' which might be floors, and '<' which could be a goal. The player's position is marked with '@', and the boulders are shown with '0' or similar. 

Looking at the map layout, the player is in a corridor with walls on the north and south sides. The boulders are nearby, and the fountains are to the southeast. The most efficient path might be to push the boulder towards the southeast fountain. 

Given that moving south previously didn't work, maybe the player needs to move east to get alongside the boulder and push it south. So the next action could be 'east' to position next to the boulder, then 'south' to push it towards the fountain. However, the last attempt to push resulted in failure, indicating an obstacle. 

Alternatively, maybe the boulder is blocked by another object. The player needs to check the surroundings for walls or other boulders. Since the map shows 'bars' which are likely obstacles, the player must navigate around them. 

In conclusion, the best next step is to move east to (37,13) to get next to the boulder and attempt to push it south towards the fountain. If that fails again, the player might need to adjust their position by moving north or west to find a clear path.

36,south,"<reasoning>
Let's try to figure out what to do next. The goal is to push the boulders onto the fountains. Looking at the current map, I need to see where the boulders and fountains are located.

From the observation, there are two boulders mentioned. One is very near northsouthwest and northnorthwest, and another is adjacent to east and southeast. The fountains are near south and westnorthwest. The player's current position is at (36, 14). 

The recent actions tried moving east, north, south, and west multiple times, but sometimes it didn't work because the boulder was adjacent in a direction that couldn't be pushed. The last message said ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain,"" which probably means the boulder is blocked by something behind it.

Looking at the cursor position and the map, the player is facing south. The map shows that there's a boulder adjacent to the east and southeast. Wait, maybe the boulder is to the east. If the player is at (36,14) and moves east, they might be next to the boulder. But earlier attempts to move east resulted in a message about failing to move the boulder. Maybe the boulder is blocked by a wall or another obstacle behind it.

Alternatively, the boulder to the northeast might need to be moved towards the fountain. The fountain is near westnorthwest, so pushing a boulder towards southwest area might not be the best. The other fountain is very near south, so maybe the boulder adjacent to east and southeast needs to be pushed south onto the fountain.

The player is at (36,14), so moving south would take them to (36,15). If there's a boulder to the east (position 37,14), pushing it south to (37,15) might get it closer to the fountain. However, the message when trying to move east before said it failed. Maybe the boulder is blocked by a wall or another boulder behind it. 

Alternatively, the player could try moving west to get around the boulder. If they move west to (35,14), then perhaps they can approach the boulder from the north or another direction. But looking at the map, the character symbol is @, and the boulder is marked with {. So the player is next to the boulder. 

Wait, the map shows #..{...<## near the player's position. The < might indicate the direction the player is facing, perhaps east. So the boulder is to the east (position 37,14). To push it south, the player would need to move east into the boulder, then move south while pushing. But earlier attempts to move east resulted in failure. Maybe there's an obstacle behind the boulder. 

Looking at the language observation, the boulder is adjacent north, east, and southeast. Wait, that might be the initial state, but after moving, positions change. The current observation says the boulder is adjacent northeast and south. So perhaps after moving, the boulder is now at (37,14) and can be pushed south to (37,15), which would be onto the fountain near south.

So the plan is: move east to be next to the boulder, then push it south. But previous attempts to move east didn't work. Maybe the boulder is blocked. Let me check the latest map. The map shows #..@...<##, which might mean the player is at (36,13) or (36,14). Wait, the cursor is at (36,14), and the map shows the player's position with @. The < might indicate facing direction. If facing east, then moving east would take them towards the boulder. 

But the last message said moving the boulder failed when trying to move east. So maybe there's a wall behind the boulder. In that case, the player can't push it further east. Therefore, they need to try pushing it in another direction. Since the boulder is adjacent northeast and south, maybe pushing it south would work. To do that, the player needs to move south into the boulder. So action: south. That way, they push the boulder south onto the fountain.

Let's see. The goal is to push the boulder onto the fountain. In the current state, the boulder is adjacent to northeast and northwest. The fountain is very near northnortheast. So maybe pushing the boulder northeast towards the fountain would work.

Looking at the map, the agent is at (36,15). The boulder is to the northeast, which would be position (37,14) perhaps. The fountain is at northnortheast, so if I move the boulder towards that direction, maybe by moving the agent north to push it?

Wait, the boulder is adjacent to northeast. So the agent needs to position themselves next to the boulder so they can push it. The agent is at (36,15). If the boulder is northeast, that would be (37,14). The agent needs to move north to (36,14) or east to (37,15) to get into position.

Wait, the boulder is adjacent north and east? Or northeast? Let me check the language observation. It says ""boulder adjacent northeast and northwest."" So the boulder is at (37,14) perhaps. The agent is at (36,15). To push the boulder northeast, the agent needs to be either north or west of the boulder. If the boulder is at (37,14), then the agent can move north to (36,14) and then push east into it. Alternatively, move east to (37,15) and push north. But the direction matters.

Wait, in Boxoban, to push a boulder, you have to walk into it from behind. So if the boulder is at (37,14), and the agent is at (36,15), moving north to (36,14) would place the agent south of the boulder. Then pushing north would move the boulder to (37,14) north, which is (37,13), but need to check if there's a floor there. The map shows some structures, maybe walls. The map display has a lot of '##########' which might be walls, but the agent's current position is at (36,15), and the boulder is adjacent northeast. So perhaps moving the agent to the northwest of the boulder to push it northeast.

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to move east to be next to the boulder. If the boulder is at (37,14), moving east to (37,15) would put the agent to the east of the boulder, allowing a push south into (37,14) south, but that's not towards the fountain. The fountain is at northnortheast, which would be (38,14) maybe. So pushing the boulder northeast towards (38,14) would require the agent to be west of the boulder and push east.

Wait, maybe the agent should move to (37,14), which is the position of the boulder. But can't move into the boulder. Instead, need to be adjacent. So if the agent is at (36,15), moving north to (36,14) puts them south of the boulder at (37,14). Then pushing north would move the boulder to (37,13). But the fountain is at northnortheast, which might be (38,14), so that's not the right direction.

Alternatively, maybe the boulder is at (37,15). If the agent moves east to (37,15), they can push north into (37,14), which might get it closer to the fountain. But I'm not sure. The map is a bit unclear with all the '##########' lines. 

Looking at the cursor position, the agent is at (36,15). The boulder is adjacent northeast and northwest. So the boulder is either to the northeast (37,14) or northwest (35,14). If it's northeast, then to push it towards the fountain (northnortheast), the agent should be north of the boulder. So moving north to (36,14), then push east. But need to check if that direction is clear. If there's a wall, can't push. From the map, it seems like there are walls, but the agent is moving around them.

Alternatively, maybe the agent should first move east to (37,15), then push north into the boulder, moving it to (37,14), which is towards the fountain's location. Then repeat to get it further. But the previous attempts show that moving south or pushing the boulder when blocked didn't work. The message when trying to push said ""in vain,"" so maybe the path behind the boulder is blocked.

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to navigate around to get a clear path behind the boulder. Let's see the latest observation: the boulder is adjacent northeast and northwest. So if the agent moves northwest to (35,14), they might be able to push it northeast. But the agent is at (36,15). Moving west to (35,15), then north to (35,14), which is northwest of the boulder. Then push east into the boulder, moving it to (36,14). Then from there, push north again. But need to check if that's possible.

But given the previous attempts, the agent has been moving east and west but not making progress. Maybe the best move is to try pushing the boulder in the correct direction. Let's try moving north to get behind it. From (36,15), move north to (36,14), then push east. If that works, the boulder would move to (37,14), which is closer to the fountain at northnortheast. Let's try that.

Let's see. I need to push a boulder onto a fountain in Boxoban. The agent is at (36,14). There's a boulder adjacent to the northeast and south based on the latest observations. The message said ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" when moving south before. Maybe the boulder is blocked by something behind it.

Looking at the map, there's a '<' symbol which might be a door or a passage. The cursor is on the samurai's position. The boulder is very near westsouthwest and northnorthwest? Wait, maybe that's a different part of the map. The language observations mention a fountain very near southsouthwest and westnorthwest. So the goal is to get the boulder onto those fountains.

In the recent moves, the agent tried moving south multiple times but failed. That could mean there's an obstacle blocking the path. The boulder might be stuck because there's something behind it. Maybe the agent needs to move in a direction that allows pushing the boulder without obstruction.

The current position is (36,14). The boulder is adjacent northeast and south. If the boulder is to the northeast, pushing it south would be towards the fountain at southsouthwest. But the agent tried moving south before and failed. Maybe there's a wall or another object behind the boulder. The agent should try pushing the boulder in the direction that's not blocked. Since the boulder is adjacent northeast, perhaps pushing it east or south.

Wait, the message when moving south said ""in vain"" because the boulder couldn't be moved. So maybe the boulder is against a wall or another object when trying to push south. Therefore, the agent should try pushing the boulder in another direction, like east or northeast. Let me check the adjacent directions.

The agent is at (36,14). The boulder is adjacent northeast (so position (37,14)) and south (position (36,15)). If the agent is trying to push the southern boulder south to (36,16), but that's blocked. Alternatively, pushing the northeastern boulder east to (38,14) towards the fountain. But is there a fountain there?

The language observation mentions a fountain very near southsouthwest and westnorthwest. The agent's current position is (36,14). The fountain westnorthwest would be towards (lower x, lower y), maybe (34,12) or similar. The boulder at northeast (37,14) might need to be pushed towards the fountain in the southsouthwest direction. Hmm, maybe the agent should move east to get next to the northeastern boulder and push it south or southwest.

Alternatively, the agent could move west to see if there's a path. Wait, the latest move was south to (36,15), then north back to (36,14). The boulder adjacent northeast is at (37,14). If the agent moves east to (37,14), they can try pushing the boulder from there. But the agent's current position is (36,14). So east would take them next to the boulder. Then, pushing the boulder east or south.

But the fountain is in the southsouthwest, so pushing the boulder towards the southwest direction. If the agent pushes the northeastern boulder southwest, that would be towards (37,13), but is there a fountain there? The language observation says fountain very near southsouthwest and westnorthwest. Maybe the agent needs to get the boulder to the southwest part of the map.

Alternatively, maybe the agent should look for a path to the fountain areas. The stairs up are near east, but that's probably not relevant here. The key is to get the boulder onto the fountain. The agent needs to navigate to the boulder and push it in the right direction.

Given that the agent is at (36,14), and the boulder is at (37,14) to the northeast, moving east to (37,14) and then trying to push the boulder south or southwest. Let's check the map again. The map shows a '<' at (37,13), which might be a door or a passage. If the agent pushes the boulder south from (37,14) to (37,15), but earlier attempts to move south failed, maybe there's a wall there. Alternatively, pushing the boulder east to (38,14) if possible.

Wait, the latest observation after moving east to (38,13) showed the boulder very near westsouthwest and northnorthwest, which might be different. Maybe the boulder in question is the one at (37,14). If the agent moves east to (37,14), they can try pushing the boulder south or east. If pushing south to (37,15) is blocked, maybe pushing east to (38,14) towards the fountain.

But the fountain is in the southsouthwest, so maybe the agent needs to move the boulder more to the southwest. Alternatively, the agent might need to find a different path. Another approach is to move west to avoid the boulder and find another way around, but the agent has been oscillating between east and west without progress.

Considering the latest observations, the boulder adjacent northeast and south. The agent is at (36,14). If the agent moves east to (37,14), they can try pushing the northeastern boulder. Let's try that. So the next action should be east to get next to the boulder, then push it in the desired direction.

Let's see where I am. The agent is at position (37,14) facing east. The last action was moving east, which allowed pushing the boulder. Now the boulder is adjacent to the east.

The goal is to push the boulder onto the fountain. Looking at the map, the current position has a fountain nearby. The message says the boulder is adjacent east, so if I move east again, I can push it further. But I need to check if there's a fountain in that direction.

From the language observation, the fountain is very near northwest and adjacent to northeast and south. Wait, after pushing the boulder east, maybe the fountain is now in the east direction. Let me confirm the positions. The cursor is at (37,14), and moving east would take me to (38,14). The boulder is adjacent east, so it's at (38,14). The fountain is very near southwest and westnorthwest. Hmm, maybe the fountain is to the southwest of the boulder? Or perhaps there's a fountain in another direction.

Alternatively, maybe the boulder needs to be pushed towards the southwest. Let me check the latest language observation. It mentions a fountain very near southsouthwest and westnorthwest. So the boulder at (38,14) needs to be moved southwest to reach those fountains. But how?

The current position allows moving east to push the boulder further east, but that might not get it to the fountain. Alternatively, moving south or west from here. If I move south, maybe I can position the boulder to the southwest. Or perhaps moving west and then south? 

Wait, the boulder is at (38,14) after pushing east. To get it to the southwest fountain, I might need to push it south or southwest. But the directions are only north, south, east, west. So moving the boulder south from (38,14) would take it to (38,15), and then maybe another push to (38,16), but I need to check if there's a fountain there. 

Looking at the map, the fountain is near southsouthwest and westnorthwest. The agent's current position is (37,14), and the boulder is at (38,14). If I push the boulder south twice, it would end up at (38,16). But I need to verify if that's near a fountain. Alternatively, moving west from (38,14) to (37,14) where the agent is, but that might not help. 

Another approach: after pushing the boulder east, maybe moving south from the agent's position to (37,15) and then try to push the boulder southeast? But the movement is only up, down, left, right. So southeast isn't an option. The agent has to move in cardinal directions. 

Wait, the message after pushing east says ""With great effort you move the boulder."" So the boulder is now at (38,14). The fountain is very near southsouthwest and westnorthwest. The agent is at (37,14). To get the boulder to the southwest, perhaps the agent needs to move south and then push the boulder west? But the boulder is at (38,14). If the agent moves south to (37,15), then can they push the boulder west to (37,14)? But that would move it back towards the agent. 

Alternatively, the agent could move south to (37,15), then move east to (38,15), and then push the boulder south to (38,16). But I need to check if there's a clear path. The language observation mentions bars in various directions, but after pushing the boulder, there's no obstacle behind it. 

Another possibility: The agent is at (37,14) with the boulder at (38,14). If the agent moves south to (37,15), then they can push the boulder west to (37,14), but that's where the agent is. Not helpful. Alternatively, move west to (36,14) and then push the boulder north? But the boulder is already at (38,14), so moving west would require the agent to be next to it. 

Wait, the agent is at (37,14), and the boulder is at (38,14). So the agent is west of the boulder. To push the boulder further east, the agent needs to be east of it. But currently, the agent is west. So the agent should move east once to be next to the boulder again, then push it east again. But that would just move it further east, away from the fountains located southwest. 

Hmm, maybe the fountains are actually in the south direction. Looking at the language observation: ""fountain very near southsouthwest and westnorthwest"". So southsouthwest of the agent's current position (37,14) would be around (36,15) or (35,16). The boulder at (38,14) needs to be moved southwest to reach there. 

But the agent can only move in north, south, east, west. So from (38,14), moving southwest isn't possible. The agent would have to move south to (38,15), then west to (37,15), then south to (37,16), etc., but that's complicated. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent should first move south to (37,15), then east to (38,15), and then push the boulder south to (38,16). Then, from there, move west to (37,16) and push the boulder west to (37,15), but that might not reach the fountain. 

Alternatively, after pushing the boulder east to (38,14), the agent can move south to (37,15), then move east to (38,15), and push the boulder south to (38,16). Repeating this might get the boulder closer to the fountain in the southsouthwest. 

But perhaps there's a more efficient path. Let me check the latest map. The agent's position is (37,14), with a boulder at (38,14). The map shows some structures with '#' and '<' symbols, but the exact layout isn't clear. The fountains are near southsouthwest and westnorthwest. 

Another idea: The agent can move south to (37,15), then east to (38,15), and push the boulder south to (38,16). Then, move west to (37,16) and push the boulder west to (37,15). But this seems like moving the boulder in a square, which might not be effective. 

Alternatively, the agent could move south twice to (37,16), then east to (38,16), and push the boulder south to (38,17). But without knowing the map layout, it's hard to say. 

Wait, the latest language observation mentions that after pushing the boulder east, the boulder is very near northnortheast and west. So the boulder is now at (38,14). The agent is at (37,14). The fountain is very near southsouthwest and westnorthwest. The westnorthwest fountain would be in the direction of (36,13) or similar. To get the boulder there, the agent needs to move the boulder west and north. But the agent is east of the boulder. 

So perhaps the agent should first move east once to be next to the boulder at (38,14), then push it west to (37,14), but that's where the agent is. Not helpful. Alternatively, move the boulder south first. If the agent moves south to (37,15), then east to (38,15), and push the boulder south to (38,16). Then, from (38,16), the agent can move west to (37,16) and push the boulder north to (37,15), but that might not help. 

This is getting a bit confusing. Maybe the best immediate action is to continue pushing the boulder east as long as possible, but that might not lead to the fountain. Alternatively, move south and try to position the boulder towards the southwest direction. 

Wait, the agent's current position is (37,14). If they move south to (37,15), then east to (38,15), and push the boulder south to (38,16). Then, from (38,16), the agent can move west to (37,16) and push the boulder north to (37,15), but that's back where they started. 

Alternatively, after pushing the boulder to (38,14), the agent can move south to (37,15), then west to (36,15), and check if there's a path to the southwest. But the language observation mentions bars in various directions, so there might be obstacles. 

Alternatively, the agent could move west to (36,14) and then try to push the boulder north or south. But the boulder is at (38,14), so the agent would need to be adjacent to it. 

Hmm, perhaps the correct approach is to keep pushing the boulder east until it reaches a fountain. The message said that after moving east, the boulder was moved, so maybe there's a fountain east of (38,14). Let's assume that pushing it further east will get it onto a fountain. So the next action would be to move east again. 

But the previous attempts to move east didn't result in a message about moving the boulder onto a fountain. The last message was ""With great effort you move the boulder."" which indicates it was successfully moved, but not placed on a fountain. 

So, the next step is to continue moving the boulder in the direction where the fountain is. Since the fountain is southsouthwest and westnorthwest, perhaps moving the boulder southwest would be better. But with only cardinal directions, the agent has to move in a combination. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent should move south and then push the boulder west. But the agent is currently east of the boulder. To push it west, the agent needs to be to the east of the boulder. So the agent is at (37,14), boulder at (38,14). To push west, the agent needs to move to (38,14) and then push west to (37,14), but that's where the agent is. So that's not possible. 

Alternatively, the agent can move south to (37,15), then east to (38,15), and push the boulder south to (38,16). Then, from (38,16), move west to (37,16) and push the boulder north to (37,15), but again, this seems inefficient. 

Maybe the correct action is to move east again to push the boulder further east, hoping that eventually it will reach a fountain. Alternatively, move south and then try to position the boulder towards the southwest. 

Alternatively, check if there's a fountain to the east of the current boulder position. If so, push it there. 

Given the information, the best immediate action seems to be to continue pushing the boulder east, as that was the last successful direction. So the next action would be to move east again.

",-0.001,False
40,west,"<reasoning>
The agent is playing Boxoban, trying to push boulders onto fountains. Let me look at the current observation.

The cursor is at (37,14). The map shows some walls (##########), dark areas, bars, and fountains. There's a boulder adjacent to east and west. The agent tried moving the boulder east before but failed. The message says ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" So maybe the boulder is stuck because there's something behind it, like another obstacle or another boulder. 

The fountains are in the northwest and south. The agent needs to push the boulder towards one of those. The boulder is currently at (37,14) east of the agent. Wait, the agent moved east to (37,14) and tried pushing the boulder again, but it didn't work. Maybe the boulder is blocked by a wall or another object. Looking at the map, the line with the boulder is #`.@`#.###, which suggests there's a wall (the # symbols) to the east of the boulder. So the agent can't push the boulder further east because there's a wall blocking the path. 

In that case, the agent should try moving south or north to position themselves so they can push the boulder around the corner. Alternatively, check if there's a way to move the boulder west. But the boulder is adjacent to west, so maybe pushing it west could free it to move east later. The agent is at (37,14), and the boulder is to the west at (36,14). If the agent moves west to (36,14), they could try pushing the boulder north or south. 

Looking at the fountain positions, the northwest fountain is near the top left, and the south fountain is further south. The agent's current position is south of the boulder. Perhaps pushing the boulder south towards the south fountain would be better. But the agent tried moving south before and the boulder didn't budge. Maybe there's a wall there too. 

Alternatively, check the language observation: bars adjacent southeast and south. So moving south from the agent's current position (37,14) might be blocked by bars. The agent needs to find a direction where the boulder can be moved without obstruction. 

Since pushing east is blocked by a wall, moving north might allow the agent to get around the boulder. If the agent moves north to (37,13), then they can try pushing the boulder west or east from there. Let me check the map again. The line above (37,13) is #.`.#.###, which has a wall to the west. So moving north might not help. 

Alternatively, moving west to (36,14) and then pushing the boulder south towards the fountain. Let's see if there's a path. From (36,14), pushing the boulder south would be towards (36,15), which according to the map might be clear. The fountain is very near south, so that could work. 

But the agent needs to get to (36,14) to push the boulder south. The agent is currently at (37,14). So moving west once to (36,14), then pushing the boulder south. 

But in the previous steps, when the agent was at (37,14) and tried pushing east, it failed because of the wall. So moving west to (36,14) would position the agent next to the boulder on the west side. Then the agent can try pushing the boulder south. 

Alternatively, maybe the boulder is stuck because another object is in the way. Looking at the language observation, there's a boulder adjacent east and west. The agent is east of the boulder, so the boulder is at (36,14). The adjacent east would be the agent's position (37,14). The boulder is also adjacent to west, which is (35,14). So the boulder is between (35,14) and (37,14). If the agent moves west to (36,14), they can try pushing the boulder in another direction. 

The goal is to get the boulder onto the fountain. The fountains are at south and northwest. The south fountain is adjacent to east and northwest. If the agent can push the boulder to the south fountain, that would solve the problem. 

So the plan is: move west to (36,14), then push the boulder south towards the south fountain. Let's check if that's possible. From (36,14), pushing the boulder south would be to (36,15). The language observation says there's a fountain very near south, so (36,15) might be on a fountain. 

Therefore, the next actions should be west to get next to the boulder, then south to push it towards the fountain. However, in the current observation, the agent is at (37,14) and tried pushing east, which failed. So moving west to (36,14) is the next step. Then, push south. 

But wait, the agent's previous action was east, leading to (37,14). The boulder is at (36,14). So moving west again would get the agent next to the boulder. Then pushing south. 

Yes, that makes sense. So the chosen action should be west to position next to the boulder, then south to push it towards the fountain.

I need to figure out how to get the boulders onto the fountains in this Boxoban-like game. Let's start by looking at the current observations and the map.

The agent is at (36,14). The map shows some structures with walls (##########), dark areas, and various features like bars and fountains. The cursor is on the agent, represented by @.

Looking at the boulders: there's one very near northeast and east, and another adjacent to west. The fountains are near northnorthwest and adjacent to northeast, east, and south. The goal is to push the boulders onto the fountains.

The message from the last action said that moving the boulder to the east didn't work. Maybe there's an obstacle there. The recent actions have been moving east and west, but not making progress. 

The boulder adjacent to the west might be the one near position (36,14) west, which is (35,14). The fountain is adjacent to northeast, east, and south. If I can push the western boulder eastward towards the fountain adjacent to northeast, that would be good. 

But wait, the agent just tried moving east and it failed. Maybe the path is blocked by bars or other obstacles. Let me check the language observation again. The bars are very near eastsoutheast, southeast, etc., which might be blocking the path. 

The agent is at (36,14). To move the western boulder (at (35,14)), the agent needs to position themselves next to it. Currently, the agent is at (36,14). So moving west once would get them next to the boulder. Once adjacent, they can push it east towards the fountain. 

But in the last observation, moving west from (37,14) to (36,14) was successful. Now, at (36,14), if the boulder is adjacent west, that's (35,14). So the agent is east of the boulder. To push it east, the agent needs to move east, but maybe the path is clear. 

The language observation mentions a boulder adjacent west, so the agent is next to it. The message after trying to move east previously said it failed. Maybe the target cell for pushing is blocked. The fountain is adjacent to northeast, east, and south. If the boulder is pushed east from (35,14) to (35,15), but that's south of the agent's current position. Wait, the agent is at (36,14). If the boulder is at (35,14), pushing east would take it to (35,14) east, which is (35,15). Is that a valid move? The fountain is adjacent to south, so maybe (35,15) is next to a fountain. 

But the problem is whether there's an obstacle in (35,15). The language observation says bars are very near eastsoutheast, etc., so maybe (35,15) is blocked by bars. If that's the case, the agent can't push the boulder there. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent should try pushing the boulder in a different direction. Since the fountain is adjacent to northeast, perhaps pushing the boulder north or northeast. But the agent is at (36,14), and the boulder is at (35,14). Pushing north would take it to (35,13). Is there a fountain there? The fountains are very near northnorthwest and adjacent to northeast, east, and south. So maybe not. 

Alternatively, the agent could move north to (36,13) and try pushing the boulder from there. But moving north from (36,14) would be towards (36,13). Then, being adjacent to the boulder at (35,14), pushing east would take it to (35,15). If that's clear, then that's the way to go. 

But the previous attempt to move east from (36,14) resulted in ""in vain"", which probably means the target cell is blocked. So maybe the path is blocked by bars or another boulder. Checking the language observation again: bars very near eastsoutheast, etc. So (35,15) might have bars, making it impossible to push the boulder there. 

In that case, the agent needs to find another path. Maybe pushing the boulder south? To (35,15) south would be (35,16), but that's probably not towards any fountain. The fountains are near southsouthwest and westnorthwest. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent should move south to (36,15) and try pushing the boulder from there. But I need to check the map layout. The map shows various ##### and ###### structures, which might be walls or obstacles. 

Given the uncertainty in the map layout, perhaps the best approach is to move the agent closer to the boulder and attempt to push it in a direction towards a fountain. Since the agent is at (36,14) and the boulder is at (35,14), moving west to get next to it isn't necessary because they are already adjacent. Wait, the boulder is adjacent west, so the agent is east of it. So the agent can try to push it east. But the previous attempt failed. Maybe the target cell is blocked. 

Looking at the language observation, there are bars very near eastsoutheast, southeast, etc. So the cell to the east of the boulder (35,15) might be blocked by bars. If that's the case, the agent can't push the boulder there. 

In that case, perhaps the agent should try pushing the boulder in another direction. For example, pushing it north to (35,13). Is there a fountain there? The fountains are near northnorthwest and adjacent to northeast, east, south. So (35,13) might not be a fountain. 

Alternatively, the agent could move north to (36,13) and then try pushing the boulder east. But again, the target cell might be blocked. 

Another possibility is that there's another boulder that needs to be moved first. The language observation mentions a boulder very near northeast and east. Maybe that one needs to be moved first. 

Wait, the agent is currently focused on the western boulder. The other boulder is near northeast and east, which is probably further away. 

Given the current situation, the best immediate action is to try pushing the western boulder again in the same direction, perhaps with a different approach. But since the previous attempt failed, maybe the agent needs to reposition. 

Alternatively, the agent could move south to (36,15) and then try pushing the boulder east from there. If the cell (35,15) is blocked, perhaps moving the agent to (36,15) allows pushing the boulder east into (35,16), but that doesn't seem correct. 

Wait, the agent is at (36,14), boulder at (35,14). If the agent moves south to (36,15), they are still adjacent to the boulder. Then, pushing east would take the boulder to (35,15). If that's blocked, maybe pushing in another direction. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent should look for a fountain in another direction. The fountains are also near westnorthwest. Perhaps pushing the boulder west, but that's away from the agent. 

This is getting a bit confusing. Let me recap:

- Agent at (36,14)
- Boulder adjacent west at (35,14)
- Fountains adjacent northeast, east, and south (probably around (37,15) or similar)
- Bars blocking the path east of the boulder

So the immediate goal is to push the western boulder east towards the fountain. But the path is blocked. Maybe the agent needs to clear the bars first, but that's not possible since the agent can't interact with bars directly. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to move the boulder in a different direction. If pushing east is blocked, perhaps pushing north or south. 

But the fountains are more likely in the northeast and south areas. 

Wait, the fountain is adjacent to northeast, which would be (37,14) or (37,15). If the boulder can be pushed to (37,14), that would place it on the fountain. 

From the agent's position at (36,14), to push the boulder from (35,14) to (37,14), the agent would need to move the boulder two cells east. That requires the agent to be adjacent to the boulder and have two clear cells in front. 

First, the agent is at (36,14), adjacent to the boulder at (35,14). To push it east, the next cell is (35,15). If that's blocked, the push fails. If it's clear, the boulder moves there, and the agent can then push it again to (36,15), and so on. 

But the previous attempt to push east from (36,14) resulted in failure, so (35,15) is likely blocked. Therefore, the agent can't push the boulder east directly. 

In that case, maybe the agent should try pushing the boulder south. From (35,14) south to (35,15). If that's clear, then the agent can move to (35,15) and continue pushing. But again, the bars are very near eastsoutheast, which might block that path. 

Alternatively, the agent could move north to (36,13) and then try pushing the boulder east. But again, the target cell might be blocked. 

Given the limited information, the best immediate action is probably to keep trying to push the boulder east, in case the previous observation was due to a temporary block or misinterpretation. Alternatively, check if there's another boulder that can be moved first. 

Looking at the language observation, there's another boulder very near northeast and south. That boulder is at, say, (37,14) or similar. If the agent can move that one towards its fountain, that would also help. 

The agent is currently at (36,14). To reach the northeastern boulder, they need to move northeast. But the map has bars and dark areas in the northeast. 

Alternatively, the agent could move north to (36,13) and then east to (37,13), but the path might be blocked. 

Given the uncertainty, perhaps the best approach is to continue attempting to push the western boulder east, in the hope that the previous blockage was temporary or a misinterpretation. If that fails, then reposition to another direction. 

But since the last attempt failed, maybe trying a different direction. Let's think: the agent is at (36,14), boulder at (35,14). If the agent moves north to (36,13), then they can try pushing the boulder east from there. The cell (35,14) east is (35,15). If moving north first, the agent is still adjacent to the boulder, and can attempt to push east again. 

Alternatively, move south to (36,15) and try pushing east. 

But without knowing the map layout well, it's hard to say. 

Another possibility is that the agent should look for the stairs up near eastnortheast, but the goal is to push boulders on fountains, so that's probably a distraction. 

Considering all this, the next logical step is to try pushing the boulder again in the same direction, perhaps after repositioning slightly to ensure the path is clear. So the agent could move north to (36,13) and then push east. 

But how to decide between north, south, or another direction? 

Alternatively, since the previous attempt to push east failed, maybe the agent should try pushing the boulder north. From (35,14) north to (35,13). If there's a fountain there, that would be good. 

But the fountains are adjacent to northeast, east, and south, so (35,13) is north of the boulder, which might not be a fountain location. 

Hmm. This is tricky. Given the limited information, perhaps the safest action is to continue trying to push the boulder east, as that's the direction towards the mentioned fountains. Even if it failed before, maybe there was a temporary obstacle or a misinterpretation. 

Alternatively, the agent could move to the northeast to check the other boulder. 

But the agent's priority is to push any boulder onto a fountain. 

Another angle: the agent's cursor is on @ at (36,14), and the boulder is adjacent west. So the agent is one step east of the boulder. To push the boulder east, the agent needs to move east, but that cell might be blocked. 

Wait, when you push a boulder, you move into the boulder's space, and it moves in the direction you're pushing. So if the agent is at (36,14) and pushes east, they would move to (37,14), and the boulder would move to (36,14). But the message said ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain,"" which implies that the cell in front of the boulder (east of it, which is (36,14)) is blocked. 

Wait, no: when you push a boulder, you need to be adjacent to it, and the cell in front of it must be clear. So if the agent is at (36,14), and the boulder is at (35,14), pushing east would require the cell (35,15) to be clear. If that's blocked, the push fails. 

So the problem is that (35,15) is blocked by bars or another obstacle. Therefore, the agent can't push the boulder east directly. 

In that case, the agent needs to find a way to move the boulder around the blockage. Maybe by moving the blockage first, but since it's bars, the agent can't do that. 

Alternatively, the agent can try pushing the boulder in a different direction, like north or south, if possible. 

If the agent moves north to (36,13), they are still adjacent to the boulder at (35,14). Then, pushing east would attempt to move the boulder to (35,15), which is still blocked. 

If the agent moves south to (36,15), adjacent to the boulder, and tries pushing east, same issue. 

Therefore, the only option might be to push the boulder west, but that's away from the agent and the fountains. 

Alternatively, the agent could move west to (35,14) and try pushing the boulder in another direction. But the agent is already east of the boulder, so moving west would place them on the boulder's space, which isn't allowed. 

Wait, no. The agent is at (36,14), west of the boulder at (35,14). To push the boulder, the agent needs to be adjacent and push in a direction. If the agent moves west to (35,14), they would be on the boulder, which is not possible. 

So the agent is correctly positioned to push the boulder east, but the path is blocked. 

Given that, perhaps the agent needs to look for another boulder to move first. The other boulder is very near northeast and east, which is probably at (37,14) or (38,14). If the agent can move that boulder towards its fountain, that would help. 

To reach that boulder, the agent would need to move east. But previous attempts to move east resulted in failing to push the boulder, but maybe that's a different boulder. 

The agent is at (36,14). To go east to (37,14), they would pass by the other boulder. If that boulder is at (37,14), then moving east would require pushing it. But the message when moving east previously said ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain,"" which refers to the western boulder. 

So the eastern boulder is at (37,14), and the agent is at (36,14). To push it east to (38,14), the agent would need to be adjacent. So moving east to (37,14) and then pushing east. But if the cell (38,14) is clear, that could work. 

But the agent's current plan is to handle the western boulder first. 

Alternatively, the agent should switch focus to the eastern boulder. Let's see: the eastern boulder is very near northeast and east. So maybe at (37,14) or (38,14). If the agent moves east to (37,14), they can try pushing that one. 

But the problem is that the agent's previous attempts to move east didn't work because they were trying to push the western boulder. Now, if the agent moves east to (37,14), they would be next to the eastern boulder and could try pushing it. 

However, the language observation mentions that the eastern boulder is very near northeast and east, so perhaps it's at (37,14). If the agent moves east to (37,14), they are adjacent to it. Then, pushing east would take it to (38,14). If that's clear, great. 

But the agent's current position is (36,14). Moving east once gets them to (37,14), adjacent to the eastern boulder. Then, pushing east would attempt to move the boulder to (38,14). If that's clear, the boulder can be placed there. 

The fountains are adjacent to northeast, east, and south. If (38,14) is near a fountain, that's good. 

Alternatively, the agent could push the eastern boulder north or south. 

But without knowing the exact positions of the fountains, it's hard to say. 

Considering all this, the next logical step is to move the agent east to (37,14) and attempt to push the eastern boulder. This might be a more fruitful approach since the western boulder's path is blocked. 

So the action would be to move east from (36,14) to (37,14), then attempt to push the boulder there. 

But the previous attempts to move east resulted in trying to push the western boulder and failing. Now, moving east to (37,14) would allow interacting with the eastern boulder. 

Therefore, the chosen action is to move east.

Let me try to figure out what to do next. The goal is to push the boulders onto the fountains. From the map and observations, there's a boulder at (37,13) and another somewhere else. The agent is currently at (37,14). The message says trying to move the boulder failed, but when moving east earlier, one boulder was moved successfully.

Looking at the map, the cursor is on the samurai at (37,14). The boulder adjacent to northeast and south. If I move east again, maybe I can push the boulder further. Let me check the previous steps. When I moved east before, the boulder moved. But the latest observation says after moving east, the boulder is adjacent east. Maybe need to check the exact positions.

The latest cursor position is (37,14). The boulder adjacent northeast and south. So, if I move east, the boulder at (37,13) would be pushed to (38,13), but need to check if there's a fountain there. The fountain is near southsouthwest and westnorthwest, which might be further south. Alternatively, maybe the other boulder is at (36,13) which was mentioned before.

Wait, in the earlier steps, after moving east, the boulder was at (38,13). The map shows the agent at (37,14) with a boulder adjacent northeast (so (38,13)) and south (so (37,15)). The fountains are very near southsouthwest and westnorthwest. Maybe the target fountain is southwest of the agent. So pushing the boulder south towards that direction.

But the agent's current position is (37,14). The boulder south is at (37,15). If the agent moves south, they can try to push the boulder further south. Alternatively, move west to get behind the boulder at (37,13) and push it east.

But the latest observation after moving east said the boulder adjacent east. So the boulder is now at (38,13), and moving east again from (37,14) would try to push it to (39,13). But need to check if there's a fountain there. The language observation mentions fountain very near southsouthwest and westnorthwest, which might be in the southwest part of the map. So maybe pushing the boulder towards the southwest.

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to move south to reach the boulder at (37,15) and push it further. But the message when trying to move the boulder before was ""in vain,"" which might mean there's an obstacle behind. Wait, the problem says you can push a boulder by walking into it as long as there's no obstacle behind. So if the agent is adjacent to the boulder and the space behind is free, they can push it.

In the current position (37,14), the boulder is to the northeast (38,13). If the agent moves east to (38,14), they can then push the boulder further east. But need to check if the space behind the boulder (39,13) is free. From the map, it's mostly bars and dark areas, but maybe there's a fountain there. Alternatively, moving south from (37,14) to (37,15) and then trying to push the boulder at (37,15) south to (37,16), towards the southwest fountain.

But the latest observations show the boulder adjacent south at (37,15). So if the agent moves south to (37,15), they can attempt to push that boulder south. Let me check the message history. Previously, when trying to push, it failed, but that might have been because the path was blocked. So need to ensure the space behind the boulder is clear.

Alternatively, maybe the agent should reposition to the west of the boulder at (37,13) to push it east. From (37,14) moving west to (36,14), then north to (36,13) where the boulder is, and then push east. But the agent was at (36,14) before, and moving west again would take them back.

Alternatively, since the agent is at (37,14), moving east to (38,14) and then pushing the boulder at (38,13) east to (39,13). If that space is clear, it could work. The language observation mentions bars very near eastsoutheast, etc., but maybe the specific spot is free.

Given that the previous attempts to push failed, maybe the agent needs to approach the boulder from the correct direction. If the boulder is at (38,13), the agent needs to be east of it to push further east. So moving east to (38,14) and then pushing east. Alternatively, if the boulder is at (37,15), moving south to (37,15) and then pushing south.

Considering the fountains are in the southwest, pushing the boulder towards the southwest direction would be better. So from (37,14), moving south to (37,15) and then pushing the boulder at (37,15) south to (37,16). If that space is free, that could get the boulder closer to the fountain.

But the problem is determining if the path is clear. The map shows a lot of bars and dark areas, but maybe the specific cells are passable. Since the agent hasn't succeeded yet, maybe they need to try different directions. Another possibility is that the agent needs to move the other boulder, the one at (36,13), towards a fountain.

In the current observation, the boulder very near westsouthwest and northnorthwest. So maybe that's the one at (36,13). If the agent moves west to (36,14), then north to (36,13), and push it east. But the agent was previously at (36,14) and moving west again would take them back.

Alternatively, the agent could try to move the boulder at (37,13) north or south. But since the agent is at (37,14), moving north to (37,13) and then pushing the boulder north. But the fountain is in the southwest, so pushing south might be better.

Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me recap the recent actions and positions:

- Agent is at (37,14).
- Boulder adjacent northeast (38,13) and south (37,15).
- Earlier, moving east from (37,14) pushed the boulder at (38,13) to (39,13), but the message said ""in vain"" later, which might mean it got stuck again.
- The fountains are at southsouthwest and westnorthwest, which are probably in the southwest corner of the map.

So maybe the agent needs to get the boulder at (38,13) towards the southwest. To do that, the agent should move east to (38,14), then push the boulder east to (39,13). If that space is clear, it would move closer to the fountain. Alternatively, if the agent moves south to (37,15) and pushes the boulder at (37,15) south to (37,16), which might be towards the southwest.

But the problem is that the map shows a lot of bars and dark areas, so the agent needs to be cautious. Another approach is to check the inventory for any tools that might help, but the inventory only has weapons and armor, no keys or other items.

Given the previous attempts, maybe the best move is to continue trying to push the boulder east. The agent is at (37,14), so moving east to (38,14) and then pushing the boulder at (38,13) east to (39,13). If that works, it might get the boulder closer to the fountain. Alternatively, move south to (37,15) and push the boulder there south.

But based on the latest observation, after moving east, the boulder is adjacent east, so pushing again east might work. Let me try that.

Let's see. The agent is in a Boxoban-like game, trying to push boulders onto fountains. From the observations, there are a few boulders and fountains on the map. The agent's current position is (37, 14), and there's a boulder adjacent to the east. The message says trying to move the boulder failed, which probably means there's something in the way—maybe another obstacle or another boulder.

Looking at the map, it's a grid with a lot of bars (maybe walls or obstacles) and dark areas. The fountains are near northnorthwest and southwest. The boulders are near northnorthwest and northnortheast. The agent tried moving east multiple times but couldn't push the boulder. Maybe the boulder is stuck against another wall or object.

The goal is to push all boulders to fountains. The agent needs to find a way to reposition the boulder. Since moving east isn't working, maybe try moving in another direction. Check the surrounding areas. The agent is at (37,14). West is position (36,14), which has a boulder very near north and eastnortheast. Maybe moving west could allow accessing another path to the boulder.

Alternatively, check the north or south. The agent was previously moving south, but that also didn't help. Perhaps the boulder needs to be pushed into a different direction where there's space. Let's look at the language observations again. The boulder adjacent east, so if the agent moves east, they are bumping into it, but it's stuck. Maybe there's a wall or another boulder behind it.

Looking at the map, the agent's current position is marked with @. The boulder is to the east, so maybe there's a wall right after the boulder, preventing it from being pushed further. The agent should try moving north or south to get around the boulder. For example, moving north to (37,13) might open up a path to maneuver the boulder.

Alternatively, check if there's a fountain nearby that the boulder can be pushed towards. The fountains are near northwest and southwest. The current boulder is near northnorthwest, so maybe pushing it south towards the fountain in southwest. But the agent needs to get around the obstacle blocking the way.

Another possibility is that the agent needs to interact with the environment differently, like using a tool or spell, but the actions available are only movement. So, the best bet is to find a path to reposition the agent to push the boulder in the right direction. Since moving east isn't working, trying west to see if there's a way to circle around the boulder.

So, the next action could be moving west again to see if there's a clear path. Or perhaps moving north to (37,13) to see if that allows accessing the boulder from a different angle. The previous attempts to move south resulted in the same message, so maybe vertical movement is needed.

Alternatively, check if the boulder is adjacent to another obstacle. If moving east isn't working, maybe the boulder is against a wall, so pushing it east would require clearing the path. But since the agent can't move the boulder, perhaps there's a wall behind it. In that case, the agent should move in a direction that allows them to position themselves to push the boulder west or north.

Considering all this, the agent should try moving west to (36,14) to see if there's a way to get behind the boulder or find another path. Or move north to (37,13) to see if that opens up options. Let's go with moving west again, as that's a recent direction and might reveal something new.

Let's take a look at the current situation. The agent is a samurai at position (36,14). There's a boulder very near northeast and east, and another fountain adjacent to northeast, east, and south. The goal is to push the boulders onto the fountains.

The agent just moved west back to (36,14), and the last attempt to push the boulder east failed because it couldn't move. So the boulder must be blocked by something, maybe another obstacle or a wall. The observation mentions bars very near northeast, east, etc., which could be walls or other structures making it impossible to push the boulder in that direction.

Looking at the map, the agent is surrounded by a lot of bars and dark areas, which might be walls. The boulder is near northeast and east, so maybe the boulder is stuck against a wall or another object. The message says ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain,"" indicating the path is blocked.

Since pushing the boulder east isn't working, perhaps the agent needs to try a different direction. The boulder adjacent to northeast and south suggests it's close to the northeast fountain. Maybe moving south towards the fountain could work if there's a path. Alternatively, checking if there's another boulder that needs to be moved first.

The agent's inventory has a katana, yumi with 26 ya, and armor. Maybe using the yumi to shoot something, but the immediate goal is to push boulders. The stairs up are near eastnortheast, but that's probably not relevant right now.

Looking at the cursor position and map layout, moving south from (36,14) might lead towards the fountain adjacent south. If there's a clear path, pushing the boulder south could place it on the fountain. Alternatively, moving north to interact with the boulder near north.

Wait, the boulder near north is at (36,13), same x-coordinate but one north. The agent is at (36,14). So moving north would bring the agent to (36,13), right next to that boulder. Maybe that's the one to push. The other boulder is at northeast (37,14), but pushing it east isn't working because of obstacles.

So perhaps the correct action is to move north to the boulder at (36,13) and try pushing it south towards the fountain adjacent south. Let me check the observations again. The fountain adjacent northeast, east, and south. So if the boulder at (36,13) is pushed south to (36,14), but the agent is already there. Maybe push it further south to (36,15), where there's a fountain.

But need to confirm the map layout. The agent's current position is (36,14). The fountain is adjacent south, so at (36,15). If the boulder at (36,13) is pushed south twice, it could reach the fountain. However, the agent needs to be adjacent to the boulder to push it. So first move north to (36,13), then push south.

The previous actions tried moving east and west but failed. So the next logical step is to move north to the boulder and attempt to push it south.

Let's try to figure out how to solve this Boxoban problem. The goal is to push all the boulders onto the fountains. From the current observations, I need to check where the boulders and fountains are located.

Looking at the latest map, the agent is at position (36,13). There's a boulder very near north, eastnortheast, and eastsoutheast. The fountains are adjacent to east, southeast, and northwest. So, the boulder to the north might need to be moved towards the fountain adjacent to the northwest. But how?

The agent tried moving east, west, south, and north before, but sometimes the boulders couldn't be moved because there was something blocking them. The message when trying to move the boulder says ""in vain,"" which probably means there's an obstacle behind it or it's already in the correct position.

Wait, the latest observation after moving north to (36,13) shows that the boulder is very near north. So maybe the agent should move north to get closer to that boulder. Then, push it south towards the fountain. Let me check the map again. The fountain is adjacent to northwest, which is towards the upper left. So the boulder to the north might need to be pushed south into the fountain adjacent to the northwest.

But the agent is at (36,13). If the boulder is north of there, moving north would get the agent to (36,12), but the boulder is very near north. Wait, maybe the boulder is at (36,12) or (35,13). Either way, the agent needs to position themselves to push it.

Alternatively, maybe the boulder adjacent southwest needs to be moved. But the fountains are east, southeast, and northwest. Hmm. Let's see the cursor position is (36,13), and the boulder is very near north. So if the agent goes north, they can get next to the boulder and try to push it south.

But in the previous steps, trying to move east or west when the boulder was there resulted in ""in vain"" messages. Maybe the boulder is blocked by walls or other obstacles. The map shows a lot of bars, which might be walls or other immovable objects. So the agent needs to navigate around those.

Looking at the map, the agent is in a corridor with lots of bars around. The fountains are in specific directions. The key is to find a path to the boulders and push them towards the fountains without getting stuck.

Another approach: check if any boulder is already on a fountain. The latest observation says the fountain is adjacent to east, southeast, and northwest. If a boulder is there, that's one Done. But the current message doesn't mention any boulder on a fountain, so all need to be pushed.

The agent's last move was north to (36,13). Now, from there, maybe moving north again to reach the boulder. Or check if moving east or west could align the agent to push the boulder.

Wait, the boulder very near north is probably in (36,12). So the agent is at (36,13). Moving north once gets to (36,12), which is where the boulder is. Then, the agent can try to push it south towards the fountain at northwest. But need to confirm the directions.

Alternatively, maybe the boulder is to the northeast. Let me visualize the map. The map has a lot of ########## which are probably walls. The agent is in a part of the map that's somewhat open but surrounded by bars and dark areas.

The agent needs to find a path to the boulders. Since moving east often didn't work because the boulder couldn't be moved, perhaps the agent should try moving north to reach the boulder and then push it south.

Another possibility: the boulder adjacent southwest (at (35,13) or (36,14)) needs to be moved. But the fountains are to the east, southeast, and northwest. If the boulder is southwest, pushing it northeast towards the fountain might work.

But the agent's current position is (36,13). If the boulder is southwest, say at (35,13), the agent can move west to (35,13) and then push it east. But the message said trying to move the boulder east before resulted in failure, so maybe there's a wall or another obstacle.

Alternatively, maybe the boulder is blocked by a wall, so the agent needs to find a different route. The key is to avoid moving in the same direction repeatedly, as the tip says there's no point in doing the same action if nothing changes.

Given the current position and the boulder locations, the best action might be to move north to get closer to the northern boulder and then push it south. Let's try that.

",-0.001,False
46,west,"<reasoning>
Let's see. I need to push the boulder onto the fountain. From the observations, there's a boulder near westsouthwest and another adjacent to the north and southwest. The fountains are in various positions, like westnorthwest and southsouthwest.

Looking at the map, the agent is at (36, 12). The cursor shows the agent's position. The boulders are around here. The message says ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain"" when trying to push it before. That probably means there's an obstacle behind the boulder. So I need to position myself so I can push the boulder in the right direction without anything blocking it.

The fountains are nearby, so the goal is to move the boulder towards one of them. Let's check the adjacent cells. The boulder is adjacent north and southwest. If I move north, maybe I can position myself to push the boulder south into the fountain. Wait, the fountain is adjacent southeast and west. So if the boulder is north, pushing it south towards the fountain in the southeast might work. 

But when the agent tried pushing before, it failed. Maybe there's something blocking the path. Let me check the map again. The map shows some bars and dark areas, which might be walls or other obstacles. The boulder is north of the agent. To push it south, the agent needs to be north of the boulder and then move south while pushing. But the agent is already at (36,12), and the boulder is adjacent north. So the agent is south of the boulder. To push the boulder south, the agent needs to stand north of it. So the agent should move north first to get into position.

Wait, the current position is (36,12). The boulder is adjacent north. So if the agent moves north to (36,13), then they can try pushing the boulder south. But in previous attempts, moving east or west didn't work because the boulder couldn't be moved. Maybe the path is clear now. Let me check the latest observation. The language observation says the boulder is adjacent north and southwest. The bars are near various directions, but maybe the path is clear to the south. 

Alternatively, maybe the boulder is stuck because there's something else behind it. The agent needs to ensure that when they push, there's nothing blocking the boulder's path. So moving west or east to reposition might help. Let me think. The agent was trying to push east before, but that didn't work. Maybe the boulder needs to be pushed west or south. 

Looking at the fountains, the closest one is adjacent southeast and west. If the boulder can be moved west into the west fountain, that would be good. The agent is at (36,12). If the boulder is north, moving west would take the agent to (35,12), then they can try pushing the boulder west. But I need to check if the path is clear. 

Alternatively, moving the agent to the west of the boulder and then pushing east. Hmm. Let's try to visualize the map. The agent is at (36,12). The boulder is north, so at (36,13). To push it south into the fountain at (36,11) maybe? But the fountain is adjacent southeast and west. Wait, the fountain's position might be at (35,11) or similar. Not sure. The map has some symbols but it's hard to parse. 

The key is to find a direction where the boulder can be pushed into a fountain. The latest message says the boulder is adjacent north and southwest. The fountains are near westnorthwest and southsouthwest. Maybe pushing the boulder southwest into the westnorthwest fountain. To do that, the agent would need to be north or west of the boulder. 

Alternatively, the agent could move southwest and then push the boulder into the fountain. But the agent's current position is (36,12). Moving southwest would take them to (35,11), which might be next to the boulder. Then pushing the boulder into the fountain. 

But I'm not sure. The best approach is to try to move the agent into a position where they can push the boulder towards a fountain. Given that the agent has been moving around without success, maybe they need to try a different direction. Let's see, the last action was north, moving to (36,12). Now, perhaps moving west to (35,12) and then trying to push the boulder east into the fountain. 

Alternatively, since the boulder is adjacent north, the agent should stand north of it to push south. So move north to (36,13) and then push south. But previous attempts to move east or west didn't work. Maybe the path is clear now. Let's try that. 

So the next action should be to move north to get into position, then push south. But the agent just moved north to (36,12) in the last step. Now, from there, moving north again would take them to (36,11), but the boulder is at (36,13). Wait, no. If the agent is at (36,12), and the boulder is adjacent north, that means the boulder is at (36,13). So the agent needs to be at (36,12) to push the boulder south to (36,11). But is there a fountain there? The fountain is adjacent west, so maybe (35,12) is a fountain. 

Alternatively, the agent needs to move west to (35,12) and then push the boulder east into the fountain at (35,13). Not sure. The map symbols are unclear. 

Another possibility is that the boulder is stuck because there's an obstacle behind it. The agent needs to check if pushing in a different direction is possible. For example, pushing the boulder west into the westnorthwest fountain. To do that, the agent would need to be north or east of the boulder. 

Given the uncertainty, the safest bet is to try pushing the boulder in one of the adjacent directions where a fountain is nearby. Since the agent is at (36,12), and the boulder is north at (36,13), perhaps pushing south into the fountain at (36,11) which is adjacent west. 

So the action should be to push south. But the command for pushing is not listed; the available actions are north, east, south, west. Wait, no—pushing is done by moving into the boulder. So to push the boulder south, the agent needs to move south into it. So the agent should be north of the boulder and then move south while being adjacent to it. 

Currently, the agent is at (36,12), the boulder is at (36,13). So the agent is south of the boulder. To push it south, the agent needs to move into the boulder's cell. Wait, no. In Sokoban-like games, you push by walking into the boulder, which requires that the cell behind the boulder is free. So the agent needs to be next to the boulder and move in the direction of the push, ensuring the space behind is free. 

So if the agent is at (36,12), the boulder is at (36,13). To push the boulder south to (36,14), the agent needs to move south into (36,13), which is the boulder's position, but that's not possible. Instead, the agent should be north of the boulder, so at (36,12), and move south into the boulder, which would push it to (36,13). Wait, no. If the agent is at (36,12) and the boulder is at (36,13), to push the boulder south, the agent needs to move into (36,13) (the boulder's position), which would require the space south of the boulder (36,14) to be free. 

But in the current observation, the boulder is adjacent north and southwest. The southwest direction from the boulder (36,13) would be (35,12), which is the agent's current position. So the boulder's southwest cell is occupied by the agent. That might be the issue. The agent is blocking the boulder's path to the southwest. So the agent needs to move away so the boulder can be pushed. 

So the correct approach is to move the agent out of the way. For example, move west to (35,12), then the boulder at (36,13) can be pushed southwest to (35,12), which is now empty. But the agent is there. Hmm, this is getting complicated. 

Alternatively, move the agent east to (37,12), then push the boulder west. But the agent tried east before and it didn't work. 

Wait, the boulder is adjacent north and southwest. The agent is at (36,12), which is southwest of the boulder. So the agent is in the boulder's southwest cell. That means the boulder is at (36,13), and the agent is at (35,12), which is southwest of the boulder. Therefore, the agent is blocking the path to the southwest. To push the boulder southwest, the agent needs to be out of the way. So the agent should move north to (36,13) (the boulder's current position), but then they'd be on top of it. That's not allowed. 

Alternatively, the agent should move west to (35,12), then the boulder can be pushed southwest to (34,11), but I'm not sure if there's a fountain there. 

This is tricky. Maybe the best move is to try pushing the boulder in a direction where there's a fountain. For example, if the boulder can be pushed east into the fountain at (37,13), but I don't know. 

Alternatively, the agent should look for a clear path. Since the boulder is adjacent north and southwest, and the agent is at (36,12), which is southwest of the boulder, perhaps pushing the boulder north into the dark area isn't helpful. The goal is to get it onto a fountain. 

Looking at the language observation, there's a fountain very near southsouthwest and westnorthwest. The westnorthwest fountain is probably at a corner. If the boulder can be moved westnorthwest, that would be ideal. 

To do that, the agent needs to be north or east of the boulder. The agent is currently southwest of the boulder. So moving the agent north to (36,13) (where the boulder is) isn't possible. Instead, the agent should move west to (35,12), then they can push the boulder north or northwest. 

But when the agent moves west to (35,12), the boulder is at (36,13). Then the agent can try to push the boulder north to (36,14) or northwest to (35,13). If there's a fountain at (35,13), that would work. 

Alternatively, pushing the boulder west to (35,12), but the agent is already there. 

This is getting too confusing without seeing the actual map layout. Based on the previous map frames, it seems like the agent is in a corridor with obstacles. The key is to find a direction where pushing the boulder results in it being on a fountain. 

Given the latest observation, the agent is at (36,12), and the boulder is adjacent north (36,13) and southwest (35,12, which is the agent's position). So the agent is blocking the boulder's path to the southwest. To push the boulder southwest, the agent needs to move out of the way. 

So the agent should move north to (36,13), but that's where the boulder is. Instead, move west to (35,12), then push the boulder southwest to (34,11). But I don't know if there's a fountain there. 

Alternatively, move the agent east to (37,12), then push the boulder west. But earlier attempts to push east didn't work. 

Another idea: since the boulder is adjacent north, the agent can try to push it north into the dark area, but that's not helpful. The target is the fountain. 

Looking back at the initial problem statement, the goal is to push the boulder onto the fountain. So the correct action is to move the agent into a position where they can push the boulder towards a fountain. Given the current position and the boulder's location, the best bet is to move the agent west to (35,12), then push the boulder southwest into the fountain at (34,11) or similar. 

But without knowing the exact fountain positions, it's hard. Alternatively, push the boulder west into the fountain adjacent west. 

Given the uncertainty, the safest action is to try pushing the boulder in a direction where a fountain is known to be. From the language observation, the fountain is very near northwest. So perhaps pushing the boulder northwest. 

To do that, the agent needs to be south or east of the boulder. The agent is currently southwest of the boulder. So moving the agent west to (35,12), then pushing the boulder northwest to (34,12). If there's a fountain there, that's good. 

Alternatively, the agent can move north to (36,13) (the boulder's position), but that's not possible. 

Given all this, the most logical next step is to move the agent west to get out of the way and then push the boulder in the desired direction. So the action should be west, then push south or southwest. But since the available actions are only north, south, east, west, the agent needs to move to the correct position. 

Wait, the available actions are movement directions. To push the boulder, the agent must move into it while ensuring the path behind is clear. So the correct action is to move in the direction opposite to where the boulder needs to go. For example, to push the boulder south, the agent moves south into it, provided the space behind the boulder is free. 

In the current position, the agent is at (36,12), boulder at (36,13). To push south, the agent needs to move south into (36,13), which requires that (36,14) is free. If that's the case, then pushing south would work. 

Checking the language observation, the boulder is adjacent north and southwest. The southwest direction from the boulder (36,13) is (35,12), which is occupied by the agent. So the path to the southwest is blocked by the agent. Therefore, pushing the boulder southwest is not possible. 

But pushing south would require the space at (36,14) to be free. The language observation doesn't mention any blocks there, so maybe it's clear. 

So the action should be south, moving into the boulder at (36,13), pushing it to (36,14). If there's a fountain at (36,14), that's good. Otherwise, it's just moving it elsewhere. 

But the agent needs to confirm if (36,14) is clear. The language observation says ""bars very near northeast, east, eastsoutheast, southeast, southsoutheast, south, southsouthwest, and southwest"", which might indicate obstacles in those directions. 

Given that, pushing south might not be possible. 

Alternatively, the agent should try pushing the boulder west. To do that, the agent needs to be north or east of the boulder. The agent is currently southwest of the boulder. So moving the agent west to (35,12), then pushing the boulder west to (35,13). If there's a fountain there, that's the goal. 

So the sequence would be: move west to (35,12), then move west again to push the boulder. But the available actions are single moves. 

In the current state, the agent is at (36,12). The best action is to move west to (35,12), then on the next turn, push west. But since we can only choose one action, the agent should move west now to position themselves. 

But looking at the latest observation, the agent just moved north to (36,12). The boulder is at (36,13), agent is at (36,12). The cursor is on the agent. 

So the next action should be to move south into the boulder, pushing it to (36,14). But the message says ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain"" when that happened before. So maybe (36,14) is blocked. 

Alternative idea: check the map again. The map shows some symbols like '{', '.', '`', etc., but it's unclear. The fountain is adjacent west, so maybe (35,12) is a fountain. If the agent is at (36,12), and moves west to (35,12), which is a fountain, then pushes the boulder east into that fountain. 

But the boulder is at (36,13). If the agent moves west to (35,12), then they can try to push the boulder east into (35,13), which is the fountain. 

So the steps would be: move west to (35,12), then move east to push the boulder into (35,13). But since we can only take one action, the agent needs to move west first. 

Therefore, the chosen action is west.

Let me try to figure out what to do next here. So, I'm playing Boxoban, and my goal is to push the boulders onto the fountains. Let me look at the current situation based on the observations.

First, my position is at (35, 12). The map shows some structures with walls (##########) and various elements. The boulders are mentioned near east and eastsoutheast, and there's a fountain near southsoutheast. There's also a staircase up eastsoutheast, but I don't think I need that right now since the goal is to get the boulders on fountains.

Looking at the boulders: one is near east and eastsoutheast, and another is very near south. The fountains are at southsoutheast and eastsoutheast. So, maybe I need to move the boulder near eastsoutheast onto the fountain there, or the one near south onto the southsoutheast fountain.

But how to approach this? I need to check if there's a clear path. The agent is currently at (35,12). Let me visualize the map. The cursor is at that position, and the map has some bars and dark areas, which might be obstacles or just parts of the environment. The key is to push the boulder towards a fountain without getting stuck.

The last action was west, moving the agent to (35,12). Now, looking at the message, there's no error, so maybe that was a valid move. The boulder adjacent to northeast—so maybe the boulder is to the northeast of the agent's current position. Let me see. If the agent is at (35,12), then northeast would be (36,13). Is there a boulder there? The language observation mentions a boulder adjacent northeast, so yes.

So the boulder is to the northeast. To push it, the agent needs to move into it from the west, right? Because if the agent is at (35,12) and the boulder is at (36,13), the agent can move east into the boulder, but only if there's space behind it. The observation says the boulder is adjacent northeast, so maybe it's at (35,13) or (36,12)? Wait, the coordinates might be a bit confusing. Let me think again.

In MiniHack, the coordinate system usually has (x,y) where x increases to the east and y increases to the north. So moving north decreases the y-coordinate, and moving east increases the x-coordinate. The agent's current position is (35,12). The boulder is adjacent northeast. Northeast would be moving east and north. So from (35,12), moving east to (36,12) and then north to (36,13) would be northeast. But the boulder is adjacent northeast, so it's probably at (36,13). To push the boulder, the agent needs to move into it from the west (current position is west of it) and then there should be a space to the east of the boulder where it can be pushed.

So the plan is: move east into the boulder at (36,13), which would push it east to (37,13). Then check if that position is on a fountain. The fountain is at southsoutheast, which might be near (37,14) or similar. Wait, the language observation says fountain very near eastsoutheast and southeast. Eastsoutheast from (35,12) would be (36,13) moving southeast? Wait, no. East is +x, south is +y. So eastsoutheast would be (36,13). But the fountain is at eastsoutheast and southeast. So the fountain is probably at (37,13) or (36,14). Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the fountain is at (36,14) which is southeast of (35,12). If I push the boulder from (36,13) to (37,13), that's east, and then from there, maybe moving it further south to a fountain. But I need to check if there's a clear path.

Alternatively, the other boulder is very near south, which would be (35,13) or (35,14). If that's the case, pushing it south towards the fountain at southeast.

Wait, the language observation says boulder very near south. So from (35,12), south is increasing y, so maybe (35,13) or (35,14). If the fountain is at southeast, which from (35,12) would be (36,13) or (35,13) moving southeast? No, southeast is east and south. So (36,13) is east, (35,13) is south, so southeast would be (36,13). Wait, maybe the fountain is at (36,14) or similar.

This is a bit confusing without seeing the actual map layout. But based on the previous map snippets, the agent is moving around in a maze-like structure with walls. The key is to find the boulders and push them towards the fountains.

Given that the agent is at (35,12) and there's a boulder adjacent northeast (probably at (36,13)), pushing it east to (37,13) might be a good move. Then check if (37,13) is a fountain. From the language observation, there's a fountain very near eastsoutheast and southeast. If eastsoutheast is (36,13), then (37,13) would be east of that, which might be adjacent to the fountain. Alternatively, the fountain could be at (37,14).

Alternatively, maybe the boulder near east and eastsoutheast is the one to target. If I can push it towards the fountain at eastsoutheast, that would solve the problem.

So the next step is to move east towards the boulder at (36,13), push it east, and then check if it lands on a fountain. Since the previous attempts to move the boulder resulted in ""in vain"" messages when there wasn't space behind, I need to ensure there's an open space behind the boulder when pushing.

In the current observation, after moving west to (35,12), the agent is adjacent to the boulder to the northeast. The message didn't say anything about moving the boulder, so the action west was valid but didn't involve pushing. Now, moving east into the boulder's position would attempt to push it. If the space behind the boulder is clear, it would work. Otherwise, it would say ""in vain"".

Looking at the language observation: there's a fountain very near eastsoutheast and southeast. Eastsoutheast from (35,12) is (36,13). If the boulder is at (36,13), pushing it east to (37,13) would place it next to the fountain at (36,13), but the fountain is at eastsoutheast, which might be (36,14) or (37,13). This is a bit unclear.

Alternatively, the boulder very near south might be at (35,13), and pushing it south towards the fountain at southeast (maybe (35,14) or (36,14)). But without seeing the map clearly, it's hard to tell.

Given the uncertainty, the safest immediate action is to try pushing the boulder that's adjacent northeast. So move east into it. The action would be east, which would push the boulder east if possible. If that works, then it might reach the fountain. If not, maybe another direction is needed.

Alternatively, the agent could move north to see if there's a clearer path. But given the previous movements, north led to a position where there were still obstacles.

Another option is to check the inventory, but the inventory doesn't seem to have any tools that would help move boulders other than pushing them by walking into them.

So, the best next action is probably to move east towards the boulder adjacent northeast to attempt pushing it towards the fountain.

Let's try to figure out the next move here. The goal is to push the boulder onto the fountain. From the current observation, I see that there's a boulder adjacent to the northeast and south. The agent is at (36, 14) based on previous moves. Now, looking at the map, the fountains are in the southwest and northwest areas. The boulders are near the northeast and east.

The agent needs to navigate to a position where they can push a boulder towards a fountain. The last successful move was pushing the boulder east, but then subsequent east moves failed because maybe there's an obstacle now or the boulder was already pushed as far as it can go. 

Looking at the current position (36,12), the boulder is adjacent north. If the agent moves north, they might be able to push the boulder further north. Alternatively, moving west might allow accessing another boulder. But the fountains are more to the south and southwest. 

Wait, the message after moving east previously said that the boulder was moved, but now moving east again isn't working. Maybe the boulder is stuck because there's something behind it now. So perhaps the agent should try a different direction. 

The agent's current position is (36,12). There's a fountain very near southsoutheast and eastsoutheast. If the agent can push a boulder towards those fountain locations, that would solve the problem. Let's check the boulder positions. The boulder very near east, southeast, and southsouthwest. So if the agent can get to the east or southeast and push the boulder southwest towards the fountain, that might work. 

Alternatively, moving west to (35,12) and then trying to push the boulder east again. But the previous attempts to push east didn't work, maybe because after pushing it once, there's now an obstacle in the next position. 

Another approach: check if there's a clear path from the boulder to a fountain. The fountain is near southsoutheast. If the boulder can be pushed south or southeast, that would place it on the fountain. 

Looking at the map, there's a staircase up near eastsoutheast. Maybe the boulder is near there. The agent could move southeast to get closer. But the agent's current position is (36,12). Moving southeast would take them to (37,13), but I need to check if that's a valid path. 

Alternatively, moving north to (36,11) and then trying to push the boulder. But the boulder is adjacent north, so moving north would allow pushing it further north. However, the fountains are more to the south. 

Wait, perhaps the agent should move south to (36,13) and then try to push the boulder east or west. Let me check the language observation again. The boulder is adjacent north, so if the agent is at (36,12) and moves north to (36,11), they can push the boulder north. But where is the fountain? The fountain is near southsoutheast, so maybe pushing the boulder south would be better. 

Alternatively, if the agent can get to the southeast of the boulder and push it southwest towards the fountain. Maybe moving east to (37,12) and then pushing the boulder southwest. But the agent's current position is (36,12). So moving east to (37,12), then perhaps pushing the boulder southwest. 

Wait, the boulder is very near east, southeast, and southsoutheast. So the boulder is probably in the vicinity of (37,13) or similar. If the agent moves east to (37,12), then they can try pushing the boulder south or southeast. 

Alternatively, the agent can move south to (36,13) and then try to push the boulder east or west. The fountains are near southsoutheast and southwest. If the boulder can be pushed into the southwest fountain, that would be ideal. 

But I need to check the obstacles. The language observation mentions bars and dark areas, which could be walls or other blocking elements. The agent can only push a boulder if there's clear space behind it. 

Given all this, maybe the best move is to move east to (37,12) and then try pushing the boulder southwest towards the fountain. Alternatively, move south to (36,13) and attempt a different direction. 

Another angle: the agent's previous successful push was east, so maybe pushing again in the same direction but further. However, the message said ""in vain"" when trying to move east again, so perhaps the boulder is now at the edge or blocked. 

Looking at the cursor position (36,12), and the boulder adjacent north. If the agent moves north to (36,11), they can push the boulder north. But where is the north area? The map shows bars far northnortheast, which might be walls. So pushing the boulder north might not be feasible. 

Alternatively, moving west to (35,12) and then trying to push the boulder east. But earlier attempts to push east didn't work, maybe because after the first push, there's now an obstacle. 

Hmm. Maybe the agent should check the surrounding cells for clear paths. Since there's a fountain near southsoutheast, perhaps the best approach is to push the boulder in that direction. To do that, the agent would need to move southeast or east-southeast. 

Given the agent's current position (36,12), moving southeast to (37,13) might allow accessing the boulder and pushing it further south. Let's try that. So the action would be southeast. 

Wait, but the allowed actions are only north, east, south, west. So diagonal moves aren't possible. The agent has to move in one of the four cardinal directions. 

So from (36,12), moving east to (37,12) and then south to (37,13) would get closer to the boulder. But perhaps moving east directly to (37,12) and then trying to push the boulder south or southwest. 

Alternatively, since the boulder is adjacent north at (36,12), if the agent moves north to (36,11), they can push it north. But again, checking the map, there are bars far northnortheast, which could be a wall, so pushing north might not work. 

Given that the fountains are in the southwest and southeast, maybe pushing the boulder towards the southeast fountain is better. To do that, the agent needs to get to the southeast of the boulder and push it. 

The boulder is very near east, southeast, and southsoutheast. So if the agent can get to (37,13) or (38,14), they could push the boulder southwest into the fountain. 

But how to get there? From (36,12), moving east to (37,12), then south to (37,13), and then see if they can push the boulder southwest. 

Alternatively, move south to (36,13), then east to (37,13), and try pushing the boulder southwest. 

Given the previous attempts to move east didn't work because the boulder was blocked, perhaps the agent should try a different path. 

Another possibility: the agent has a yumi (bow) and ya (arrows) in inventory. Maybe using the bow to shoot an arrow towards a boulder or a wall to create a clear path. But using the bow would consume arrows, and the goal is to push boulders, not use ranged attacks. So maybe that's not the priority. 

Considering all this, the most logical next move is to move east to (37,12) to get closer to the boulder and attempt to push it south or southeast towards the fountain. However, since previous east moves didn't work, maybe the boulder is now in a position where pushing east is blocked. 

Alternatively, move south to (36,13) and try to push the boulder east. But the boulder is adjacent north, so moving south would take the agent away from the boulder. 

Wait, the boulder is adjacent north of the agent's current position (36,12). So if the agent moves north to (36,11), they can push the boulder north. But if that's blocked, perhaps they need to find another direction. 

Alternatively, the agent could move west to (35,12) and then try to push the boulder east. But the agent tried moving east before and it didn't work. 

Hmm. Maybe the best approach is to move in a direction that allows pushing the boulder towards the fountain. Since the fountain is near southsoutheast, pushing the boulder in that direction. From (36,12), moving east to (37,12), then south to (37,13), and then attempting to push the boulder southwest. But the allowed actions are only cardinal directions, so from (37,13), pushing southwest isn't possible directly. The agent would have to move south and then west, or west and then south, but that might not effectively push the boulder into the fountain. 

Alternatively, the agent could move southeast to (37,13) and push the boulder west, but that might not reach the fountain. 

Wait, the boulder is very near east, southeast, and southsoutheast. So if the agent can get to the southeast of the boulder and push it southwest, that would place it on the fountain. 

Assuming the boulder is at (37,13), the agent needs to be at (37,14) to push it west into the fountain. But the agent's current position is (36,12). So moving east to (37,12), then south to (37,13), then east to (38,13), but that's getting further away. 

This is getting a bit complicated. Let's recap:

- Goal: push boulder onto fountain.
- Current agent position: (36,12).
- Boulder adjacent north at (36,11) perhaps.
- Fountains near southsoutheast and southwest.
- To push the boulder towards southsoutheast, need to move it in that direction.

The agent should move in a direction that allows pushing the boulder south or southeast. From (36,12), moving east to (37,12) and then south to (37,13), then trying to push the boulder west or southwest. 

But the agent can only push by moving into the boulder, so if the agent is at (37,12) and the boulder is at (37,13), pushing south would move the boulder to (37,14). Then, from (37,13), the agent could move west to (36,13) and push the boulder west again. 

However, this requires multiple steps. Given that the agent should avoid repeating the same actions, the next immediate action should be to move east towards the boulder to attempt another push. 

But previous attempts to push east didn't work. Maybe because after the first push, the boulder is now at (37,13), and pushing east again would require the agent to be at (37,13) to push it further east, but there's a fountain near southsoutheast. Alternatively, pushing the boulder south from (37,13) into the fountain. 

So the sequence would be: agent moves east to (37,12), then south to (37,13), then pushes the boulder south to (37,14), which is towards the fountain. 

But how to execute this in one move? The agent can only make one action at a time. So the first step is to move east to (37,12). 

Alternatively, the agent could move south to (36,13) and then try to push the boulder east. 

Given the current position and the boulder's location, the best immediate action is to move east to (37,12) to get closer to the boulder and attempt another push.

I need to figure out how to push the boulder onto the fountain in this Boxoban-like game. Let me look at the current situation.

First, the agent is at position (37, 12). The map shows some structures with walls (#) and various elements like bars (which might be obstacles), dark areas, fountains, and boulders. The inventory lists a katana and wakizashi, some arrows, and armor. But since I'm playing as a samurai, maybe using the katana isn't necessary here; the main goal is pushing boulders.

Looking at the language observations, there's a fountain very near south and west. The boulder is adjacent to east and northwest. The stairs are up near eastsoutheast, which might be a way out once the boulders are in place, but the priority is getting the boulder onto the fountain.

The message history shows previous attempts to push the boulder but failing. That probably means the boulder is blocked by something. In the last observation, the boulder is adjacent to east and northwest. The agent is at (37,12), so to the east is position (38,12). If the boulder is there, maybe there's an obstacle behind it preventing movement.

The map has a '<' symbol at (37,12), which might be a door or a movable object. The boulder is at (38,12) since it's adjacent east. Let me check the map again. The line for the agent's position shows #..{...<##, which might mean the '<' is to the east of the agent. So the boulder is east of the agent, but perhaps there's a wall or another obstacle behind it when trying to push.

Wait, in the current map, the agent is at (37,12). The line for that row is #`.{`#.###. The '<' is at position 37, so that's the agent's position. To the east (38,12) is a '#', which is a wall. So the boulder is probably in front of that wall. That's why pushing it fails—there's a wall behind it. 

So the plan is to move the agent to a position where they can push the boulder towards the fountain. The fountain is near south and west. The agent is at (37,12). Looking at the fountains, there's one very near south (which would be (37,13)) and another near west (which would be (36,12)). 

The boulder is at (38,12) east of the agent. To push it towards the west fountain at (36,12), the agent needs to move the boulder west. But the boulder is currently at (38,12), adjacent east to the agent. To push west, the agent would need to move west, then push the boulder west. But since the agent is already at (37,12), moving west to (36,12) and then pushing the boulder west to (35,12) might be possible if there's no wall there.

Wait, looking at the map row for y=12: the agent is at position 37. The row is #`.{`#.###. So positions 36 is '`', 37 is '{', 38 is '.', which might be a floor, and then more '#'. So from (37,12) (the agent's position), moving west to (36,12) is allowed (since it's a '`' which is probably a floor). Then, from there, the agent can try to push the boulder west from (38,12) to (37,12). But wait, the boulder is adjacent east to the agent at (37,12). So if the agent moves west to (36,12), then they can approach the boulder from the west and push it west to (35,12). 

But need to check if there's a wall at (35,12). Looking at the map row for y=12, it's ########. The agent's current row is y=12, and the next row down (y=13) is similar. So (35,12) is a '#', which is a wall. That means the boulder can't be pushed into (35,12). So that approach won't work.

Alternative idea: Maybe push the boulder south towards the fountain at (37,13). The agent is at (37,12). The boulder is at (38,12). If the agent moves south to (37,13), then tries to push the boulder south to (38,13). Check if (38,13) is a floor. Looking at the map row for y=13: the line is #``{`#.###. So position 38 is '`', which is a floor. Then, pushing the boulder south to (38,13) would place it adjacent to the fountain at (37,13)? Wait, the fountain is very near south, which would be (37,13). If the boulder is pushed to (38,13), then it's adjacent to the fountain at (37,13), but not on it. To get it onto the fountain, the boulder needs to be exactly on the fountain's position.

Wait, the fountain's positions are very near southsouthwest and westnorthwest in some observations, but in the current observation, the fountain is very near south and west. So the fountain at (37,13) south of the agent is the target. So if the boulder can be pushed to (37,13), that would place it on the fountain. But how?

The agent is at (37,12). The boulder is at (38,12). To push the boulder south to (38,13), the agent needs to be adjacent to the boulder. So from (37,12), the agent can move south to (37,13), then push the boulder south to (38,13). Then, from (38,13), the agent can move west to (37,13) and push the boulder further west to (36,13), which is a floor (since the map row y=13 has position 36 as '`'). Then, the boulder would be at (36,13), which is adjacent to the fountain at (37,13)? Or is the fountain at (37,13) itself? This is getting a bit confusing. Let me re-examine the language observations.

Current language observation says: fountain very near south and west. The agent is at (37,12). So south would be (37,13), and west would be (36,12). The fountain at south is (37,13), and the one at west is (36,12). The boulder is at (38,12). To get the boulder onto the south fountain (37,13), the agent needs to move it there. 

But the boulder is at (38,12). To get it to (37,13), the agent would have to push it south once, then west once. Let's see:

1. Agent is at (37,12). Move south to (37,13).
2. Then push the boulder south from (38,12) to (38,13).
3. Now, agent is at (37,13). Move west to (36,13).
4. Push the boulder west from (38,13) to (37,13). Now the boulder is at (37,13), which is the fountain's position. That would solve the problem.

But need to check if each step is possible. 

Step 1: Moving south from (37,12) to (37,13). The map row for y=13 is #``{`#.###. Position 37 is '{', which is likely a floor. So that's allowed.

Step 2: Pushing the boulder from (38,12) to (38,13). The agent is at (37,13) now. The boulder is at (38,12) east of the agent's previous position. Wait, after moving south to (37,13), the agent is now at that position. The boulder is still at (38,12). So the agent needs to move east to (38,13) to be adjacent to the boulder. Then push it south.

Wait, the boulder is at (38,12). The agent is at (37,13). To push the boulder, the agent needs to be adjacent to it. So the agent needs to move east to (38,13), then push the boulder south to (38,14). But that's moving away from the fountain. Hmm, maybe this approach isn't right.

Alternative approach: After moving south to (37,13), the agent can move east to (38,13), then push the boulder south to (38,14). But that's not helpful. 

Perhaps I need to re-examine the map layout. The map for y=12 is ########. The agent is at (37,12) which is the '{' in that row. To the east is '.' (38,12), then more '#'. So the boulder is at (38,12). To push it west, the agent needs to be to the west of the boulder. So the agent should move west to (36,12), then push the boulder west to (35,12). But as previously determined, (35,12) is a wall, so that's not possible.

Alternatively, push the boulder north. The agent is at (37,12). The boulder is at (38,12). If the agent moves west to (36,12), then north to (36,11), they could perhaps push the boulder north. But the map for y=11 isn't shown, but assuming it's similar, maybe there's a floor. However, the target fountain is at (37,13), so pushing north might not help.

Wait, the other fountain is at westnorthwest, which might be (34,11) or something, but the current focus is on the south fountain at (37,13).

Another idea: The agent needs to get the boulder to (37,13). To do that, they can push it south twice. First, move the agent to (38,12) east of the boulder, then push south. But the agent is currently at (37,12). So move east to (38,12), but that's where the boulder is. Wait, no—the boulder is adjacent east to the agent. So the agent is at (37,12), boulder at (38,12). The agent is already adjacent to the boulder. So the agent can try to push it west, but there's a wall at (36,12). So pushing west is blocked. 

Alternatively, push the boulder south to (38,13). Then, from there, push it west to (37,13). Let's try that:

1. Agent is at (37,12). Push the boulder south to (38,13). Is there a floor at (38,13)? Looking at the map row y=13: #``{`#.###. Position 38 is '`', which is a floor. So pushing south is possible.
2. Now, the boulder is at (38,13). The agent is still at (37,12). Need to move the agent to be adjacent to the boulder. Move south to (37,13).
3. Now, the agent is at (37,13). The boulder is at (38,13). Push it west to (37,13). That would place the boulder on the fountain at (37,13). 

But wait, pushing the boulder from (38,13) west to (37,13) requires the agent to be at (38,13) west of the boulder. The agent is at (37,13), which is west of the boulder's new position (38,13). So the agent can push it west into (37,13), which is the fountain's location. That should work.

So the steps would be:

- Push the boulder south from (38,12) to (38,13).
- Move agent south to (37,13).
- Push the boulder west from (38,13) to (37,13).

This would place the boulder on the fountain. Let's check if each step is possible.

First action: Push south. The agent is at (37,12), adjacent to the boulder at (38,12). Command 's' (south) would push the boulder to (38,13). The message says ""With great effort you move the boulder."" which indicates success. 

Next, move south to (37,13). The map row y=13 at x=37 is '{', which is a floor. 

Then, push west. The agent is at (37,13), adjacent to the boulder at (38,13). Command 'w' (west) would push the boulder to (37,13), which is the fountain. 

This should solve the puzzle. So the sequence of actions would be:

south (push boulder south)
south (move to new position)
west (push boulder west onto fountain)

But need to check the current state. In the latest observation, the agent is at (37,12), and the boulder is adjacent east. So the first action should be pushing south. 

The available actions are north, east, south, west. So the correct action now is to push the boulder south. In the game, pushing a boulder is done by moving in the direction you want to push it. So to push the boulder south, the agent needs to move south, which would cause the boulder to move south as well.

Therefore, the chosen action is 'south' to push the boulder south onto the floor at (38,13), then move south again and push west. But the user is asking for the next action based on the current observation. The current observation shows the agent at (37,12), boulder at (38,12). The next immediate action to take is to push the boulder south, which is possible if there's no wall behind it. Since the map shows that (38,13) is a floor ('`'), this should work.

So the correct next action is 'south' to push the boulder south.

Let's see. I need to figure out the next move in this Boxoban game. The goal is to push the boulders onto the fountains. Let's look at the current observation.

The agent is at position (37, 13). The map shows some bars and dark areas, but the key elements are the boulders and fountains. From the language observation, there's a boulder very near westsouthwest and northnorthwest. Also, a fountain is very near southsouthwest and westnorthwest. The agent just moved south to (37,13), so maybe they want to position themselves near a boulder to push it.

Looking at the message history, when the agent tried to push a boulder east before, it failed because there was something blocking it. So maybe the boulder to the westsouthwest needs to be pushed towards a fountain. The fountain is at southsouthwest, so perhaps moving the boulder in that direction.

The agent's current position is next to a boulder adjacent to northeast and southeast. Wait, the language observation says ""boulder adjacent northeast and southeast"" at (37,13). So there's a boulder to the northeast and southeast of the agent. If the agent is at (37,13), then northeast would be (38,14) and southeast would be (38,12). But the agent moved south to get here, so maybe the boulder is to the northeast.

To push a boulder, the agent needs to walk into it, and there must be no obstacle behind it. Let's check the map. The map shows some symbols, but it's a bit unclear. The cursor is on the agent's position, which is marked with @. The boulder is adjacent northeast and southeast. So if the agent is facing a direction, maybe they can push the boulder north or south.

But the agent's last move was south to (37,13). The boulder adjacent northeast would be to the right (east) and north. Wait, coordinates can be confusing. Assuming y increases downward, moving north would decrease y. So if the agent is at (37,13), northeast would be (38,14). If there's a boulder there, the agent could try to push it west or south.

But the fountain is at southsouthwest, which is to the southwest direction. So maybe pushing the boulder towards the southwest. If the boulder is at (38,14), pushing it south to (38,13) might move it towards a fountain. Or maybe there's a fountain further west.

Alternatively, there's another boulder at westsouthwest, which is southwest direction from the agent. Pushing that towards the fountain at westnorthwest might work. But the agent would need to move west to reach that boulder.

Wait, the language observation mentions ""boulder very near westsouthwest and northnorthwest."" So maybe there are two boulders. One near westsouthwest (southwest of agent) and one near northnorthwest (northwest of agent). The agent is at (37,13). Let's calculate positions:

- Westsouthwest would be (36,12).
- Northnorthwest would be (36,14).

But the agent is at (37,13). The boulders are at those positions. The fountain is at southsouthwest (which would be (36,15)) and westnorthwest (34,14?), but not sure. The message says ""fountain very near southsouthwest and westnorthwest."" 

The agent's current position is (37,13). To reach the boulder at westsouthwest (36,12), the agent would need to move west to 36, then south to 12. But maybe there's a better path. Alternatively, the boulder at northnorthwest (36,14) is north of the agent. If the agent moves north to 14, they can push that boulder south towards the fountain.

But looking at the recent moves, the agent tried pushing east before but failed. Maybe the best approach is to move west to 36, then south to 12 to handle the boulder there. Alternatively, check if the boulder at (38,14) (northeast) can be pushed south.

Wait, the agent is at (37,13). The boulder adjacent northeast and southeast. If the boulder is to the northeast (38,14), then the agent can try to push it west (towards 37,14) or south (37,12). But pushing west would require space. Let me check the map again.

The map shows some symbols, but it's hard to parse. The agent's position is at (37,13), marked with @. The line for y=13 has ""#`.{`#.###"" — assuming the @ is in the correct position. The boulder adjacent northeast would be at (38,14), which might be a 'B' or similar, but the map doesn't show it clearly. The language observation says the boulder is adjacent northeast and southeast, so the agent is next to it.

If the agent wants to push the boulder, they need to walk into it. So moving northeast (to 38,14) would push the boulder west (to 37,14) if there's space. But the bars and dark areas might be blocking. Alternatively, move southeast (38,12) to push it north, but that might not lead to a fountain.

The fountain is at southsouthwest, which is southwest direction from the agent. So maybe pushing a boulder towards the southwest. If there's a boulder southwest of the agent, pushing it further southwest towards the fountain. But the boulder near westsouthwest (36,12) is southwest. The agent could move west to 36,13, then south to 12, and push the boulder at (36,12) southwest to (35,11), but need to check if there's a fountain there.

Alternatively, the boulder at (36,14) (northnorthwest) can be pushed south to (36,13), then further south to (36,12) towards the fountain at (36,15). That might not be the right direction. Maybe pushing the boulder at (36,14) east to (37,14), which is where the agent is now. But the agent is at (37,13), so pushing the boulder from (36,14) east to (37,14) would require the agent to be at (36,14) and move east into the boulder.

This is getting a bit confusing. Let's recap:

- Agent is at (37,13).
- Boulders near westsouthwest (36,12) and northnorthwest (36,14).
- Fountains near southsouthwest (36,15) and westnorthwest (34,14?).
- The agent needs to push a boulder onto a fountain.

The most straightforward path might be to go to the boulder at (36,12) (westsouthwest), push it towards the fountain at (36,15). To get there, the agent needs to move west to 36,13, then south to 12. Once there, push the boulder south to 13, then to 14, 15, but need to check if there's a path.

Alternatively, the boulder at (36,14) (northnorthwest) can be pushed south. The agent is at (37,13). If they move north to 14, then west to 36, then push the boulder from (36,14) south to (36,13), etc.

But considering the recent moves, the agent tried pushing east but failed. Maybe the best move now is to move west to position near the boulder at (36,12) and then push it south towards the fountain.

So the next action should be west to (36,13).

Let's try to figure out what to do next in this Boxoban game. The goal is to push all the boulders onto the fountains. From the current observation, I'll check the position of the boulders and fountains.

Looking at the cursor's position (36,13), I remember there's a boulder adjacent to the southwest. The fountains are near the southeast, east, and northwest. The player is at (36,13). The stairs are up near eastnortheast, but I think the goal is to push the boulders onto the fountains first.

In the last move, I moved west to (36,13). The boulder is to the southwest, so maybe I can move towards it. The problem is that when I tried pushing the boulder east before, it didn't work because there might be something blocking it. Let me check the map again. 

The map shows that at position (36,14), there's a boulder very near northeast and east. Wait, maybe the boulder is to the east of my current position. If I move east again, perhaps I can push it towards a fountain. But earlier attempts to push it east failed. Maybe there's an obstacle behind it. Let me think.

The fountains are adjacent to northeast and south. If I can push the boulder to the northeast fountain, that would be good. But to do that, I need to navigate around any obstacles. The dark areas might be walls or other blocks. The language observation mentions bars very near east, eastsoutheast, etc., which could be walls or other structures.

Alternatively, maybe the boulder is stuck because there's a wall behind it. If I can move in a direction that allows pushing it away from the wall, then perhaps I can get it to the fountain. Let me consider moving south to get closer to the boulder. 

Looking at the current position (36,13), moving south to (36,14) might bring me next to the boulder. Once I'm adjacent, I can try pushing it north towards the fountain. But earlier attempts to push east didn't work, so maybe the boulder is blocked there. Alternatively, pushing it south towards the south fountain might be possible.

Wait, the fountains are adjacent to northeast and south. The current boulder is near north, so pushing it south onto the fountain there would be ideal. Let me check if moving south and then pushing the boulder south into the fountain is possible.

I need to move to the position adjacent to the boulder. From (36,13), moving south to (36,14) would place me next to the boulder. Then, pushing it south to (36,15) where there's a fountain. But I need to make sure there's no obstacle in that path. The map shows that at (36,15), there's a fountain, so that should work. 

So the plan is: move south to (36,14), then push the boulder south to (36,15) onto the fountain. Let me confirm the movement. The previous moves had some issues with pushing east, but south might be a better direction here. 

Another thing to consider is the inventory. I have a katana and yumi, but pushing boulders doesn't require weapons. Maybe using the yumi to stab the boulder, but in Boxoban, you can only push, not pull or stab. So the correct action is to move towards the boulder and then push it in a direction where there's a clear path to a fountain.

Alright, I'll move south and then push the boulder south.

The agent is in a Boxoban-like environment and needs to push boulders onto fountains. The goal is to navigate and push the boulders correctly. Let's look at the current observation.

The agent's position is (36,12). The map shows some structures with fountains and boulders. The previous actions tried moving around but didn't successfully push a boulder yet. The last attempted action was ""push south,"" but that wasn't valid, so it defaulted to north.

Looking at the language observation, there's a boulder very near north and eastnortheast. The fountains are adjacent to southeast and west. The agent has a katana and yumi (bow), but probably needs to use pushing actions.

The message history shows that pushing a boulder before resulted in success, but recent attempts to move east again failed. The current position is (36,12), and the boulder is north. Maybe the agent needs to move north to position themselves behind the boulder to push it south towards the fountain.

Alternatively, check if there's a boulder adjacent that can be pushed south into a fountain. The fountains are nearby, so the correct strategy is to locate a boulder near a fountain and push it into place.

Looking at the map, the fountain is adjacent southeast and west. The boulder is very near north. If the agent moves north to (36,11), they might be able to push the boulder south into the fountain at (36,13) which is adjacent to a fountain.

So the plan is: move north to get behind the boulder, then push south towards the fountain. Let's verify the positions. If the boulder is at (36,13) and the agent is at (36,12), moving north to (36,11) would position them to push the boulder south to (36,13), which is a fountain spot. That should work.

53,push west,"<reasoning>
Let's see. I'm playing Boxoban, which is a box-pushing game. My goal is to push all the boulders onto the fountains. The agent is a samurai, and I can push boulders by walking into them if there's no obstacle behind them.

Looking at the current observation, the cursor is at position (36,12). The map shows some walls (##########), dark areas, and various features like fountains and boulders. The message says ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" which means I tried to push a boulder but couldn't, probably because there's something blocking its path behind.

From the language observation, there are boulders very near east, southeast, and southsouthwest. The fountains are adjacent to southeast and west. So maybe one of the boulders is near the southeast fountain, but I need to check if it's already on a fountain.

The inventory shows I have a katana and a yumi (bow), but pushing boulders doesn't require shooting, so maybe just movement is needed.

Earlier actions were trying to move east and west, pushing south, but it didn't work. The last valid action was 'north', which moved the agent up. Now the agent is at (36,12). The boulder adjacent north might be the one I tried to push before. Let me see the map again.

The map lines show some structure, but it's a bit hard to parse. However, the key points are the boulders' positions and the fountains. The agent needs to position themselves to push the boulders towards the fountains.

Since the last attempt to push south failed, maybe the boulder is blocked by a wall or another boulder. Alternatively, the agent might not be positioned correctly to push it. Let's think about the surroundings.

If the boulder is to the north of the agent, pushing it south would move it towards the fountain adjacent southeast and west. But since the previous push south didn't work, perhaps the boulder is stuck. Maybe there's another obstacle behind it. Alternatively, the agent needs to move in a different direction to get a better angle.

Looking at the cursor position (36,12), maybe moving east or west could allow pushing the boulder in the right direction. Alternatively, checking if there's a clear path behind the boulder.

Another approach is to check the fountains' positions. The fountain very near southsoutheast might be the target. If a boulder is near there, pushing it onto the fountain would solve the level. So maybe the agent needs to move closer to that boulder and push it towards the fountain.

Wait, the language observation says ""fountain very near northwest"" and ""fountain adjacent northeast and south"". Also, ""boulder adjacent east"". So maybe there's a boulder east of the agent that needs to be pushed towards the fountain adjacent northeast.

But the agent is at (36,12). If there's a boulder to the east, pushing it west might not be the way. Alternatively, if the boulder is to the south, pushing it north onto the fountain.

But the previous attempts to push south didn't work. Maybe the boulder is blocked. Let me check the latest map. The map shows ""#..@...<##"" at position (36,12), which might indicate the agent's position with '@' and possibly a boulder or fountain nearby.

In the map, the line for y=12 has ""#..@...<##"" which could mean the agent is at position 36 (since x=36), and the '<' might indicate a direction or a feature. Maybe the boulder is to the south of the agent, and pushing it requires being in the right position.

Alternatively, the agent might need to move around to get behind the boulder. For example, if the boulder is to the north, the agent needs to move north to get behind it and push south.

But the latest message says trying to move the boulder but failing. So perhaps the agent is not positioned correctly. Let's consider the possible actions: north, south, east, west, and push in those directions.

Given that the agent is at (36,12), moving south would take them to (36,13), which is where the cursor was previously. Maybe there's a clear path there. Alternatively, moving east to (37,12) and try pushing the boulder west.

But the previous attempts to push south didn't work. Maybe the boulder is stuck because there's another boulder or a wall behind it. The language observation mentions ""boulder very near east, southeast, and southsouthwest"", so there might be multiple boulders in those areas.

Alternatively, the agent should check if any boulders are adjacent and try to push them in a direction that leads to a fountain. For example, if there's a boulder adjacent east, pushing it west could place it on a fountain.

But the fountain adjacent southeast and west might need a boulder to be pushed there. Let me think. If the agent can push a boulder from east to west into the fountain adjacent west, that would solve part of the problem.

Alternatively, the stairs up near eastnortheast might be a distraction, but the priority is pushing boulders to fountains.

Given the agent's current position and the failed push south, maybe the best action is to move east and try pushing the boulder west towards the fountain. Or move north to see if there's a different path.

Wait, the agent was previously at (37,14) and moved west to (36,14), then north to (36,13), then north again to (36,12). The boulder adjacent north at some point, but now it's adjacent east.

Looking at the latest map, the agent is at (36,12) with the map line ""#..@...<##"". The '<' might indicate a direction or a feature that's blocking the push. Maybe the boulder is to the east, and pushing it requires being west of it.

In that case, moving west to (35,12) and then pushing east could work. Alternatively, moving east to (37,12) and trying to push the boulder west.

But the previous attempt to push south failed, so maybe the agent should try pushing east or west instead.

Another possibility is that the boulder is blocked by a wall. The map has a lot of ##########, which are walls, so the agent needs to navigate around them to get behind the boulders.

Considering all this, the next logical step is to try pushing the boulder in a direction that leads it towards a fountain. If the boulder is east of the agent, pushing it west towards the fountain adjacent west might be the way. So the action would be 'push west'.

But the user's available actions are north, east, south, west, and push in those directions. So the correct action format would be 'push west'.

Alternatively, if the boulder is to the south, 'push south' again, but since that failed before, maybe there's another obstacle. Maybe the agent needs to move around to get a clear path.

But given the information, 'push west' seems like a viable option to try moving the boulder towards the fountain.

54,east,"<reasoning>
Let's try to figure out what to do here. The goal is to push the boulders onto the fountains. From the observations, there's a boulder adjacent to the east. The agent is at (36,12). The message says that pushing the boulder before hasn't worked, maybe because there's something blocking it behind.

Looking at the map, the boulder is east of the agent. The latest attempt to push south or west didn't work because the boulder isn't moving. Maybe the direction needs to be different. Wait, the agent tried pushing south and west, but perhaps the boulder is stuck against another obstacle or needs to be pushed in a specific direction to reach the fountain.

The fountains are mentioned as being adjacent to south and southwest. The boulder adjacent east might be near a fountain if pushed correctly. Let me check the language observations again. The fountain is very near northwest, but there's also a fountain adjacent north and southwest. The agent's current position is (36,12), and the boulder is east. If the agent pushes the boulder east, maybe it moves towards the fountain in the southwest?

Wait, the latest map shows that pushing west resulted in the agent being back at (36,12). The boulder is still there. The message says ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" So maybe the boulder is blocked by another obstacle or there's something in front. The agent needs to find a way to get around the block.

Looking at the cursor position and map, maybe there's a wall or another boulder blocking the path. The agent should first try to move around the boulder to a position where they can push it in the right direction. For example, moving north or south to get a clear path.

Alternatively, maybe the boulder needs to be pushed into a corner where the fountain is. Let's think: if the boulder is east of the agent, and the fountain is southwest, perhaps pushing the boulder south-east would place it on the fountain. But the directions are north, east, south, west. So to push southeast, the agent would have to move diagonally, but the allowed actions are only the four cardinal directions. So maybe push east first, then south?

Wait, but the agent can't move diagonally. So if the boulder is east, pushing it east would require the agent to be adjacent and move into it. But the previous attempts to push east didn't work. Let me check the messages again. The first message when pushing east said ""With great effort you move the boulder,"" but later attempts to push east again failed. That inconsistency is confusing. Maybe there was a temporary block or the boulder was already moved.

Alternatively, perhaps the boulder is stuck against another object. The agent needs to navigate around to find a position where they can push it towards the fountain. Let's see: the agent is at (36,12). The boulder is adjacent east. The fountain is adjacent south and southwest. So if the agent moves south to (36,13), then pushes the boulder east-south (but can't), or moves east to be next to the boulder and pushes south? Wait, the agent tried pushing south before but it didn't work. Maybe the boulder is blocked by a wall or another boulder.

Looking at the map, the symbols might indicate walls or other objects. The map has a lot of '#' which are walls, and '.' which are floor. The boulder is represented by '{' maybe? The agent's position is marked with '@'. The cursor is on the agent. The map shows:

                                  ##########                                    
                                  ##########

                                  #`.{`#.###                                    
                                  #.{#######                                    
                                  ##########                                    
                                  ##########                                    

But the exact positions are hard to parse without the grid. However, based on the cursor coordinates, the agent is at (36,12). The boulder adjacent east would be at (37,12). The fountain adjacent south is at (36,13). So maybe pushing the boulder south-east into the fountain at (37,13)? But since movement is cardinal, the agent needs to push the boulder in a direction that moves it towards the fountain.

If the boulder is at (37,12), pushing it south would move it to (37,13), which is adjacent to the fountain. That could work. So the agent should move to (37,12) by going east, then push south. But previous attempts to push east didn't work. Maybe the boulder is blocked. Alternatively, the agent needs to check if there's space behind the boulder.

Another approach: the agent is at (36,12). The boulder is east at (37,12). If the agent moves east to (37,12), then tries to push south, that might work. But the message says ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" when trying to push east before. Maybe the boulder is stuck against a wall or another object. Let me check the map again. The map shows at position (37,12) there's a '<' which might be a staircase or a door. If the boulder is trying to go into a '<', it's blocked. So the agent needs to find a way to push the boulder around that obstacle.

Alternatively, maybe the agent should first move south to (36,13), then try to push the boulder east. But the boulder is already east. Hmm. This is getting complicated. Let's think step by step.

1. Agent's current position: (36,12)
2. Boulder adjacent east at (37,12)
3. Fountain adjacent south at (36,13) and southwest at (35,11) maybe?
4. To get the boulder onto the fountain, need to push it to (37,13) which is adjacent to the fountain.
5. To push the boulder from (37,12) to (37,13), the agent needs to be at (37,12) and push south.
6. But the agent is at (36,12). So first move east to (37,12), then push south.

But previous attempts to push east resulted in failure. Why? Maybe there's an obstacle at (37,12) that wasn't visible. The map shows a '<' at (37,12) in the sixth line. Looking at the map:

Line 6: #..@...<## 

So position (37,12) is the '<' character. That's likely a staircase down or a door. If the boulder is at (37,12) and the agent tries to push it east into the '<', it's blocked. Therefore, the boulder cannot be pushed further east because there's a staircase or door there. So the agent needs to find another direction to push the boulder towards the fountain.

The fountain is at (36,13) (south) and maybe (35,11) (southwest). If the boulder can't go east, perhaps push it south to (37,13), which is a floor ('.') if the '<' is at (37,12). Wait, the '<' is at (37,12), so (37,13) would be a different tile. Let's assume that pushing the boulder south from (37,12) to (37,13) is possible if that tile is a floor and not blocked.

In that case, the agent needs to move east to (37,12), then push south. But the problem is that the boulder is already at (37,12), adjacent to the agent's east. So the agent should move east, then push south. But previous attempts to push east didn't work, possibly because the boulder is stuck against the '<'.

Wait, maybe the boulder is already at (37,12) and the agent is trying to push it into the '<', which is blocked. Therefore, the agent needs to find a way to push the boulder in a different direction. For example, push it north or west, but that wouldn't get it to the fountain.

Alternatively, maybe the agent should first move south to (36,13), then try to push the boulder east from there. But the boulder is at (37,12), so moving the agent to (36,13) and then trying to push east would require the agent to be at (36,12) and push east, which is the same as before.

Hmm, this is tricky. Another possibility is that there's another boulder blocking the path. The observations mention ""boulder very near northnorthwest and west"", so maybe there's a boulder that's blocking the path when trying to push the eastern boulder.

Alternatively, the agent might need to use a different tactic, like moving around to a position where they can push the boulder around the obstacle (the '<'). For example, move south to (36,13), then east to (37,13), and then push the boulder south from there. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the agent's current position is (36,12). If they move south to (36,13), then east to (37,13), they could be in a position to push the boulder south from (37,12) to (37,13). But the agent would have to be at (37,12) to push it. This is getting confusing without a clear map layout.

Alternatively, maybe the agent should try pushing the boulder west towards the fountain in the southwest. If the boulder is at (37,12), pushing west to (36,12) where the agent is, but that's where the agent is, so that wouldn't place it on a fountain.

Alternatively, maybe the fountain is at (35,11), so pushing the boulder southwest. But again, movement is cardinal.

I think the best approach is to move the agent to (37,12) by going east, then attempt to push the boulder south to (37,13), which is adjacent to the fountain. If that's possible, then the boulder would be on the fountain. But previous attempts to push east resulted in failure, so maybe there's an obstacle. The '<' at (37,12) might be blocking the boulder's movement east, but if the agent pushes south, the boulder would move to (37,13), which is likely a floor tile.

Therefore, the agent should first move east to (37,12), then push south. Even if the previous pushes didn't work, maybe this time it will. Let's try that.

<|ACTION|>east<|END|>

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**
1. **Current Position:** Agent is at (36, 12), with a boulder adjacent to the east at (37, 12).
2. **Goal:** Push the boulder onto the fountain adjacent to the south (at (37, 13)).
3. **Action Plan:** 
   - Move **east** to (37, 12) to position directly next to the boulder.
   - Push the boulder **south** from (37, 12) to (37, 13), placing it on the fountain.

Previous attempts to push failed due to potential blockages, but reaching the boulder's east position first is crucial to attempt a valid push south toward the fountain.

Let's see where I am in this Boxoban game. The goal is to push all the boulders onto the fountains. I need to check the current state based on the observations provided.

Looking at the cursor position, I'm at (37, 12). The map shows some structures with hashes and symbols. The language observation mentions fountains near south and west, and a boulder adjacent to east and northwest. There's also a stairs up near eastsoutheast, which might be a way out once the level is completed.

The message history shows that earlier attempts to push boulders failed, like ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" That probably means there's an obstacle behind the boulder or it's already in a correct position. 

From the latest observation, the boulder is adjacent to east and northwest. The fountains are adjacent to south. So maybe the boulder next to east needs to be moved south onto the fountain. Let me check the map again. The agent's position is marked with @, and there's a boulder (probably a # or similar symbol) to the east. If I move east, I might be able to push the boulder further east, but the fountain is to the south. Alternatively, pushing the boulder south towards the fountain would be better.

Wait, the cursor is at (37, 12). If I move east to (38, 12), there's a boulder adjacent there. To push the boulder, I need to move in the direction opposite to where I want to push it. So to push the boulder east, I should move west into it. But if the boulder is already to the east, maybe I need to check if there's space behind it to the east. Alternatively, if the boulder is at (38,12) and I'm at (37,12), pushing it east would require moving west into it, which might not be possible if there's a wall or another obstacle.

Looking at the map structure, the lines have ########## which are probably walls. The agent is in an area that's not surrounded by walls on all sides. The fountains are very near south and west, so maybe the boulder adjacent east is near a fountain but not on it yet. 

Another approach: since the boulder is adjacent east, maybe I need to position myself to the northwest of the boulder to push it south towards the fountain. But my current position is (37,12). If the boulder is at (38,12), then pushing it south would require moving it to (38,13). Is there a space there? The cursor's position after moving south would be (37,13), and the boulder would move to (38,13). I need to check if (38,13) is a floor (.) and not a wall or another obstacle.

From the map description, the lines have various symbols, but the exact positions of the boulders and fountains aren't explicitly shown in the map text. The language observations mention the locations relative to the agent. So based on that, the boulder is to the east, and the fountain is to the south. Therefore, pushing the boulder south would align it with the fountain.

So the action should be to move west into the boulder to push it east, but that might not be the right direction. Wait, no. To push a boulder, you need to move towards it from the opposite direction. For example, to push a boulder east, you need to move west into it. So if the boulder is to the east (position (38,12)), I need to move west to (37,12) and then push it east by moving west again? That doesn't make sense. Wait, no. When you're next to a boulder and you move in the direction you want to push it, you push it one tile in that direction. So if I'm at (37,12) and the boulder is at (38,12), to push it east, I need to move east into it, which would push it to (39,12). But if there's a wall at (39,12), that won't work. 

Looking at the map, the lines are ########## which are likely walls. So pushing the boulder east might be into a wall, which is impossible. Therefore, the correct direction to push the boulder would be south. To do that, I need to move south into the boulder, which is at (38,12), pushing it to (38,13). If (38,13) is a floor and not a wall or another boulder, then that's possible. 

Since the fountain is adjacent to south, moving the boulder south onto the fountain would solve the puzzle. So the action should be to move south into the boulder, which would be a push action. However, the available actions are north, south, east, west, and push direction. But in the problem statement, the possible actions are only the movement directions. Wait, the initial problem says the possible actions are north, east, south, west. But in Boxoban, pushing a boulder requires moving in the direction you want to push it, which is effectively a push action. However, the user's instruction mentions that the possible actions are the four directions. But in reality, to push a boulder, you move towards it, which is equivalent to pushing it in the opposite direction. 

Wait, the user's initial message says: ""You can push the boulders by walking into them, as long as there are no obstacles behind them."" So the action is to move in the direction of the boulder, which pushes it one tile in that direction. Therefore, the action ""south"" would mean moving south, which if there's a boulder to the south, it would push the boulder further south. 

But in the current observation, the boulder is adjacent east, not south. So moving south would not push that boulder. The boulder adjacent east is at (38,12), so to push it east, I need to move west into it. Wait, no. If I'm at (37,12) and the boulder is at (38,12), to push it east, I need to move west into it, which would push it to (39,12). But if there's a wall at (39,12), that's not possible. 

Alternatively, maybe there's another boulder somewhere else. The latest language observation mentions a boulder very near northnorthwest and west. So perhaps there's another boulder that needs to be moved. The fountains are very near northwest and south. 

The agent's current position is (37,12). The fountain adjacent south is at (37,13) perhaps. If I can push a boulder to (37,13), that would place it on the fountain. 

Looking back, the boulder adjacent east is at (38,12). To push it south to (38,13), the agent would need to move south into it. So action: south. This would push the boulder from (38,12) to (38,13), which is south. If (38,13) is a floor, then this is valid. 

The previous messages indicate that pushing sometimes fails, but in this case, if there's no obstacle behind, it should work. The agent's inventory doesn't show any obstacles, and the language observation doesn't mention walls south of the boulder. 

Therefore, the best action is to move south to push the boulder towards the fountain.

Let's see where I am. The agent is a samurai in a Boxoban-like environment. The goal is to push boulders onto fountains. The cursor is at (37,13), and the map has several fountains and boulders around.

Looking at the observations, there's a boulder adjacent to the northeast and southeast. The fountains are near the south and west. The previous actions tried moving around but hitting walls or boulders. The last valid action was ""east"" leading to (37,12), but then trying to push south or west didn't work because the boulders couldn't be moved.

Now, the agent is at (37,13). The message says ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain"" when trying to push south or west. So maybe the boulders there are blocked. The fountains are adjacent to the south and west. So perhaps the strategy is to find a boulder that can be pushed towards a fountain.

Looking at the map, the agent is near a boulder to the northeast (maybe at (38,12)) and southeast (maybe (37,14)). But the fountains are south and west. The agent should move towards a boulder that's near a fountain and can be pushed. 

The stairs up are near eastnortheast, but maybe that's not the priority. The current position has a boulder adjacent to the east (since the agent is at 37,12 east moved to 37,13? Need to check the map. The map shows #..@...<## at some position, but the exact layout is unclear from the given info. 

Alternatively, since the fountains are adjacent south and west, perhaps the agent should move south to the fountain and push a boulder there. But the last attempt to push south failed. Maybe the boulder is blocked by another obstacle or another boulder. 

The agent's current position is (37,13). If there's a boulder to the south (37,14), perhaps pushing it south into the fountain at south. But need to check if the path is clear. The language observation mentions a boulder very near southsoutheast and southwest. So maybe the boulder is at (38,13) or (37,14). 

If the agent moves south to (37,14), maybe they can push the boulder further south into the fountain. But the previous attempt to push south resulted in failure, so maybe the boulder is stuck. Alternatively, moving west to (36,13) and then trying to push a boulder west into the fountain adjacent west. 

Looking at the cursor position, moving west would take the agent to (36,13), which has a boulder adjacent west. If the agent moves west and then tries to push west again, that boulder might move into the fountain. Let's think: moving west to (36,13), then push west. The fountain is adjacent west, so if the boulder is there, pushing it west into the fountain would solve it. 

Alternatively, the agent could move south to (37,14) and check if there's a boulder there to push into the south fountain. But the message said pushing south didn't work before, maybe because the boulder is blocked. 

Another option is to check the inventory. The agent has a yumi (bow) and arrows. Maybe using the bow to shoot a boulder, but that's less common in Boxoban. More likely, need to physically push. 

So, the best move might be to go west to (36,13), where there's a boulder adjacent west. Then push west into the fountain. That seems possible. Let's try that path.

Let's see where I am. The goal is to push all the boulders onto the fountains. Looking at the map, I can see a boulder adjacent to the east. The previous attempts to push didn't work, probably because there's a boulder in the way or an obstacle behind it.

The agent is currently at (36,13). The nearby boulders are to the east and southwest. The fountains are to the east, southeast, and northwest. I need to figure out how to navigate to push the eastern boulder onto a fountain. 

First, check the surroundings. The cursor shows the boulder adjacent east. To push it south towards the fountain there, I need to move the agent next to the boulder so they can push it. The current position is facing east, so moving one step east would place the agent next to the boulder. Then, pushing south should move the boulder into the fountain. But wait, the message says ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain"" when trying to push before. Maybe there's another boulder behind it or an obstacle. 

Looking at the map, there's a `<` symbol at (37,14), which might be a door or a wall. If the boulder is against that wall, pushing it wouldn't work. Alternatively, there could be another boulder in the path. The agent needs to reposition to get a clear path to push the boulder south into the fountain adjacent to southeast. 

Perhaps moving south to get a better angle. Or west to free up space. Wait, the agent is at (36,13). If they move south to (36,14), maybe that allows pushing the boulder east or south. Alternatively, maybe the boulder is stuck against a wall. Let's check the map again. The map shows `#..{...<##` which might indicate a wall with a `<` door. If the boulder is against that door, the agent can't push it through. So maybe the door needs to be closed or opened first. 

In Boxoban, sometimes doors need to be closed to push boulders through. The agent has a yumi (bow) and ya (arrows), but using them to open a door might be necessary. However, the inventory shows the yumi is present but not drawn. Drawing the bow could allow opening the door. Once the door is open, the boulder can be pushed into the fountain. 

So the steps could be: move to the door, draw the yumi, shoot the door to open it, then push the boulder south into the fountain. Alternatively, maybe the boulder can be pushed east into another fountain. Let's check the fountains' positions. The fountain adjacent southeast and west. If the boulder is pushed east, it might reach the southeast fountain. 

Another possibility: the agent needs to move around the boulder to get a clear path. For example, move north to (36,12), then try pushing the boulder east. But the current position is (36,13), and moving north would be (36,12). Let's see the observations. The boulder adjacent east is at (37,13). If the agent moves to (37,13) by going east, then tries to push south, but if there's a wall or another boulder in the way, it won't work. 

Looking at the language observation, there's a boulder very near north and eastnortheast. The agent needs to navigate carefully. Maybe moving west to (35,13) and then try pushing the boulder from there. Alternatively, check if there's a clear path south from the boulder. 

Wait, the message when trying to push before said ""in vain,"" which usually means there's an obstacle behind the boulder. So the boulder is stuck against something. To push it, need to ensure there's space behind it. The agent could try pushing in a different direction. For example, if the boulder is at (37,13), pushing west into (36,13) where the agent is, but that's where the agent is standing. Not helpful. 

Alternatively, pushing the boulder north into (37,12). Is there a fountain there? The fountain adjacent north and southwest. If pushed north, it might reach the fountain. But need to check if that path is clear. The map shows `#` walls, so maybe the path is blocked. 

Alternatively, use the bow to open a door that's blocking the boulder's path. The `<` symbol is a closed door, I think. Shooting it with an arrow would open it. The agent has 26 ya arrows. So the plan would be: move to the door's position, draw the yumi, shoot the arrow to open the door, then push the boulder through the now-open doorway into the fountain. 

Let me think about the coordinates. The door is at (37,14) according to the map's `<` symbol. The agent is at (36,13). To reach the door, they need to move east to (37,13), then north to (37,14). Once there, draw the bow (action: draw yumi), then shoot (action: fire east or north). Opening the door would allow pushing the boulder. 

But this requires multiple steps and using the inventory items. The agent might need to manage their inventory first. However, the current problem is that the previous push attempts failed, likely due to the door being closed. So the correct next action is to shoot the door to open it. 

Therefore, the agent should move to the door's location, draw the bow, and fire an arrow to open it. Once the door is open, they can push the boulder into the fountain. 

So the steps would be:
1. Move east to (37,13).
2. Move north to (37,14) to be next to the door.
3. Draw the yumi.
4. Fire the arrow north or east to open the door.
5. Then, move to push the boulder south or east into the fountain.

But the agent needs to execute these actions in order. Since the previous actions were just moving around, the immediate next action should be to move towards the door. 

Looking at the current position (36,13), moving east once gets to (37,13), which is adjacent to the boulder. From there, moving north to (37,14) reaches the door. So the next action should be east to get closer to the door and the boulder.

I need to figure out the next move here. I'll start by looking at the current state of the game.

The agent is at position (37,13). The map has several features, but the key elements are the boulders and fountains. The goal is to push all boulders onto fountains. 

Looking at the language observations, there's a boulder very near northnorthwest and west. The fountains are adjacent to south, southwest, and northwest. So there's a fountain to the south, southwest, and northwest of the agent's current position. 

The agent previously tried pushing the boulder south and west but failed. The error messages indicated that the attempt to move the boulder failed, meaning there might be an obstacle behind it or the agent wasn't positioned correctly to push. 

Now, the agent is facing a boulder to the north. To push a boulder, the agent needs to be next to it and have a clear path behind it. The current position is (37,13). If there's a boulder to the north (which there is, according to the observations), the agent can try pushing it south. 

Wait, the last observation after pushing south resulted in the message ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" That suggests that when the agent tried to push south, maybe there's something blocking the path behind the boulder. Let me check the map again. 

Looking at the map, the agent's current position is (37,13). The boulder is adjacent east, which was mentioned in some previous observations. Wait, in the latest cursor position, the boulder adjacent is northeast and southeast. Hmm. Maybe the boulder is to the northeast? 

Wait, the latest language observation says: ""boulder very near westsouthwest and northnorthwest."" So the boulders are to the westsouthwest and northnorthwest of the agent's current position. The agent is at (37,13), so westsouthwest would be towards (36,12), and northnorthwest would be towards (36,14). 

But in the current map, the agent's position is (37,13). The cursor shows the agent as ' Hatamoto' at that coordinate. The map has some symbols like #, ., `, {, }, etc., which might represent walls, features, or other objects. 

The key is to locate the boulders and fountains. The fountains are adjacent south, southwest, and northwest. The agent is at (37,13). The fountain adjacent south would be at (37,14), southwest at (36,14), and northwest at (36,12). 

Looking at the boulders: very near westsouthwest (36,12) and northnorthwest (36,14). So there's a boulder at (36,12) and (36,14). The agent needs to push these onto the fountains. 

The agent is at (37,13). The boulder at (36,12) is to the westsouthwest. To push that boulder towards the fountain at (36,12) northwest, which is the same position? Wait, maybe the fountain is at (36,12) northwest? That might be confusing. 

Alternatively, perhaps the boulder at (36,12) needs to be pushed east to reach the fountain at (37,12) southwest. Or maybe the fountain is at (36,12) itself. Wait, the observation says ""fountain very near northwest."" The agent's current position is (37,13), so northwest would be (36,12). There's a boulder at (36,12), so pushing it onto the fountain there would be the goal. 

But the agent tried pushing south before, which might not be the right direction. Let me think. If the boulder is at (36,12), and the agent is at (37,13), then the agent needs to move west to be adjacent to the boulder. Then push it east towards the fountain at (36,12) southwest? Wait, maybe the fountain is at (37,12) southwest. 

Alternatively, the fountain adjacent south is at (37,14). If the boulder at (36,14) (northnorthwest of agent) needs to be pushed south to (37,14), which is a fountain. That makes sense. 

So the agent is at (37,13). The boulder to the northnorthwest is at (36,14). To push that south, the agent needs to move north to be adjacent to it, then push south. But the agent was at (37,13) previously, and moving north would take them to (37,12). Wait, but the cursor position after previous moves was (37,12) then (37,13). 

Alternatively, maybe the boulder is at (36,13) north of the agent. Wait, the observations mention ""boulder adjacent east"" in some steps, but currently, the adjacent boulders are northeast and southeast. 

This is a bit confusing. Let's recap:

- Agent is at (37,13).
- Boulders very near westsouthwest (36,12) and northnorthwest (36,14).
- Fountains adjacent south (37,14), southwest (36,14), and northwest (36,12).

So the boulder at (36,12) is next to the northwest fountain. If the agent can push that boulder onto the fountain, that would solve one part. But to do that, the agent needs to be west of the boulder, i.e., at (36,12), and then push east. However, the agent is currently at (37,13). 

Alternatively, the boulder at (36,14) (northnorthwest of agent) is near the southwest fountain at (36,14). To push that south to (37,14), which is a fountain. 

The agent is at (37,13). To reach the boulder at (36,14), the agent needs to move northwest. But movement is only allowed in the four cardinal directions. 

From (37,13), moving northwest would involve moving north and west alternately, but since movement is step-by-step, the agent can go north to (37,12), then west to (36,12), then north to (36,13), then east to (36,14), positioning adjacent to the boulder. But that's a long path. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a more direct path. But considering the agent's current position and the need to avoid redundant moves, perhaps the best approach is to move west to (36,13), then north to (36,12), where there's a boulder, and push it east onto the fountain at (36,12) northwest. Wait, but the fountain at northwest would be (36,12), so pushing the boulder there would mean the boulder is already at the fountain. 

Wait, the observation says ""fountain very near northwest."" If the agent is at (37,13), northwest is (36,12). There's a boulder very near westsouthwest (36,12), so that boulder is at (36,12). The fountain is at (36,12), so the boulder is already there. That can't be right. Maybe the fountain is adjacent to (36,12). 

Alternatively, the fountain is at (37,12) southwest. The agent is at (37,13). If there's a boulder at (36,12), pushing it east to (37,12) would place it on the fountain. 

So the plan would be:

1. Move west from (37,13) to (36,13).
2. Move north to (36,12), adjacent to the boulder.
3. Push east to (37,12), placing the boulder on the fountain at (37,12).

But in the previous steps, the agent tried pushing south and west but failed. Maybe the path is blocked. Let me check the map again. The map shows several # symbols, which are likely walls. The agent's position is at #..@...<##, which might mean that movement in some directions is blocked by walls. 

Looking at the map row for y=13 (assuming y increases downward), the line is ""#`.{`#.###"". The agent is at position x=37, y=13. In this row, the characters are: # . ` . { ` # . ###. So at x=37, which is the 8th position (if counting from 0), the character is '#'. Wait, maybe the map's coordinates are different. This part is a bit unclear. 

Alternatively, perhaps the map's rows are represented differently. The agent's position is (37,13), so in the map display, that would be the 37th column and 13th row. But the map lines show a lot of # symbols, which might be walls. If the agent is next to a wall, they can't move in that direction. 

Given the confusion in the map layout, maybe the best approach is to focus on the relative positions from the language observations. The agent needs to get to the boulder at (36,12) and push it east to the fountain at (37,12). To do that, the agent needs to move west to (36,13), then north to (36,12), then push east. 

But the previous attempts to push resulted in failure, so maybe the path is blocked. Alternatively, the boulder might be stuck due to another obstacle. 

Another possibility is that the agent needs to push the other boulder at (36,14) south to the fountain at (37,14). To do that, the agent would need to move north to (37,14), but that position might be a wall. 

Given the limited information, the most logical next step is to move west to get closer to the boulder at (36,12) and attempt to push it east towards the fountain. So the action would be to move west again, then north, then push east. 

But the agent just moved west in the previous step and is now at (36,13). The next logical move is to move north to (36,12), where the boulder is, and then push east. 

So the chosen action would be ""push east"".

Let's see. The agent is in a Boxoban-like environment trying to push boulders onto fountains. The goal is to manipulate the boulders to their target positions. From the current observations, the agent's position is (x=37, y=12). The map shows some structures with fountains and boulders nearby.

Looking at the language observation, there's a boulder very near southsoutheast and southwest. The fountains are adjacent to south and west. Also, there's a stairs up near eastsoutheast, which might be a way out but not relevant right now. The agent needs to push the boulder onto a fountain.

The previous attempts to push the boulder south or west failed, probably because the boulder wasn't in the correct position or there was an obstacle. The current cursor is at (x=37, y=12). The map shows that to the east, there's a boulder, and to the west, maybe a fountain. 

The agent should try to push the boulder east towards the fountain adjacent to the southeast and west. Since the boulder is very near southsoutheast and southwest, maybe the agent needs to move closer to it. But the latest position after previous actions has the agent at (37,12), and the boulder is southsoutheast. 

Wait, the message says ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" when trying to push west or south before. Maybe the boulder is blocked by another obstacle or the agent isn't positioned correctly. The agent needs to approach the boulder from the right direction. 

Looking at the map, the agent is at (37,12). The boulder is very near southsoutheast and southwest. Perhaps moving south or southeast would get the agent closer to the boulder. Alternatively, pushing east might work if the boulder is there. 

But the current cursor position is (37,12), and the boulder is southsoutheast. So moving south to (37,13) might bring the agent next to the boulder. Then, pushing east could move it towards the fountain. Alternatively, pushing south again to position the boulder towards the fountain. 

Since the previous push attempts didn't work, maybe the agent needs to position themselves correctly. Let's check the latest observation: after moving east to (37,12), the boulder is very near southsoutheast and southwest. So moving south to (37,13) would place the agent adjacent to the boulder. Then, pushing south again could move the boulder towards the fountain adjacent to southeast and west. 

Alternatively, if the boulder is to the southeast, pushing it east might move it closer to the fountain. The agent should check the direction of the fountain. The fountain is adjacent to southeast and west. So if the boulder is pushed east, it might land on the southeast fountain. 

But the agent's current position is (37,12). To push a boulder to the southeast, the agent needs to be north of it. So moving south to (37,13) and then pushing south or southeast. However, the map shows that moving south from (37,12) brings the agent to (37,13), which is adjacent to the boulder. Then, pushing south from there would move the boulder to (37,14), which might be towards the fountain. 

Alternatively, pushing east from (37,12) if the boulder is there, but the observation says the boulder is southsoutheast. So moving south first makes sense. 

So the plan is: move south to (37,13), then push south to move the boulder towards the southeast fountain. Let's check if that's possible. The message when pushing before was ""in vain,"" maybe because the boulder was blocked. If the agent is now adjacent, pushing should work. 

Alternatively, maybe the boulder is blocked by a wall or another object. The map shows ########## in various rows, which are probably walls. The agent needs to navigate around them. 

Looking at the map, the agent is in a corridor. The boulder is southsoutheast, so moving south would lead towards it. Once adjacent, push south. 

Therefore, the next action should be south to get close, then push south again.

The agent needs to push a boulder onto a fountain in Boxoban. Let's look at the current observation.

The player's position is (37, 11). The map shows several boulders and fountains. The key points are:

- There's a boulder adjacent to the southeast and west.
- The fountain is near the south and southwest.
- The stairs are up near eastsoutheast, but the goal is to push boulders onto fountains.

The previous actions tried pushing south and west, but maybe the agent isn't positioned correctly. The boulder is southeast, so moving closer to it would help. The player is at (37,11), and the boulder is adjacent southeast. Moving east would bring the player next to the boulder. Once adjacent, pushing east would move the boulder towards the fountain to the south.

So, the next steps should be:
1. Move east to position (38,11) to be adjacent to the boulder.
2. Push east to move the boulder towards the fountain.

But the agent needs to check if there's an obstacle behind the boulder. The map shows bars and dark areas, but the immediate area behind the boulder (east of it) might be clear. Assuming it's clear, pushing east would place the boulder on the fountain south of there.

So the best action is to move east first, then push east. However, the previous attempts to push directly might have failed if not adjacent. Let's verify the current cursor position and the boulder's location.

The cursor is at (37,11), and the boulder is adjacent southeast. So moving east to (38,11) would make the player adjacent to the boulder. Then pushing east would move the boulder to (38,11) + east = (39,11), which should be towards the fountain.

Therefore, the correct action sequence is east then push east. But since the agent can only choose one action at a time, the immediate action should be to move east to get into position. However, the last action was a default north, which isn't helpful. The correct action now is to move east.

Let's try to figure out the best move here. I'm in a Boxoban-like game where I need to push boulders onto fountains. The agent is a samurai at position (37,11). The map has a lot of bars and dark areas, which I assume are obstacles or walls.

Looking at the observations, there's a boulder adjacent to the southeast and west. The nearest fountain is very close to the south and westsouthwest. The agent is trying to move east but is blocked by bars. The message says ""You cannot pass through the bars,"" so east is not an option right now.

The current plan was to push the boulder south, but previous attempts to push didn't work, maybe because the boulder isn't in position. Let me check the cursor position again. The agent is at (37,11), and the boulder is adjacent to the southeast (which would be (38,11) or (37,12)) and west (36,11). Since the agent is at (37,11), pushing west would be towards (36,11), but there's a boulder there. Wait, the boulder adjacent west means there's a boulder at (36,11). To push it, the agent needs to move into it, but only if there's space behind it. 

The fountain is at south and westsouthwest. If I can push the western boulder towards the westsouthwest fountain, that would be good. The boulder is at (36,11), and the agent is at (37,11). To push west, the agent would need to move into the boulder at (36,11), but can they? The agent's position is (37,11), so moving west would take them to (36,11), which has a boulder. But can they push the boulder westward? That would require the space behind the boulder (35,11) to be unoccupied. If that space is free, then pushing west would move the boulder to (35,11). 

Looking at the map, the cursor's position is (37,11), and the map shows a `@` there. The line for y=11 has `#.`@######`... So, the agent is in a corridor. To the west is a boulder. The area behind the boulder (35,11) is likely a floor since there's no mention of a wall or barrier there. So, the action should be to push the boulder west. That would move it towards the westsouthwest fountain, which is a goal. 

But the previous attempts to push resulted in messages saying the agent couldn't move the boulder. Maybe the direction was wrong. Since the boulder is adjacent west, pushing it west (towards (35,11)) should work if that space is clear. Let me confirm the map details. The map line for y=11 is `#.`@######`, which suggests that at x=36, y=11 is a `.` (floor), x=37 is `@`, and beyond that are `#` (walls). Wait, no, the `#` are probably walls. So the agent is at (37,11) with a `@`, and to the west (x=36,11) is a `.` (floor), then a `#`? Wait, the map line is `#.`@######`, which would be positions x=34: #, x=35: ., x=36: @, x=37: #, etc.? That might not be right. Maybe the map formatting is different. Alternatively, perhaps the `#` are walls surrounding the play area. 

In any case, the key is that the boulder is adjacent west, and pushing it west would be the correct action to move it towards the fountain. The previous errors might have been due to typos in the action (like ""push south"" instead of specifying the direction correctly). Since the agent is at (37,11), pushing the west boulder would require the action ""push west"". 

So the best action now is to push the boulder west towards the fountain.

Let's see. The agent is in a Boxoban-like environment, trying to push boulders onto fountains. The previous actions tried moving east, south, west, and pushing in various directions, but some of those resulted in errors because of bars or the boulder not moving.

Looking at the current observation, the agent is at (37, 11). The map shows a lot of bars and dark areas, which are probably obstacles. There's a boulder adjacent to the southeast and west. The fountains are near the south and westsouthwest. The message says the agent can't pass through bars, so moving into those is impossible.

The goal is to push the boulders onto fountains. The nearest boulder seems to be adjacent to the west. The agent is trying to push towards the south, but there's a bar blocking the path. Maybe the agent should try pushing the boulder westward towards a fountain. However, the cursor position is (37,11), and the boulder is adjacent west. So pushing west would move the boulder to (36,11). Then check if there's a fountain there. The fountain is near westsouthwest, which might be further west. Alternatively, maybe there's a fountain to the south that's accessible after moving the boulder.

But the agent just tried pushing south and east, which didn't work because of bars. The latest action was pushing west, which didn't work either. So perhaps the agent needs to reposition. Let's check the language observation again. The boulder adjacent west means there's a boulder right next to the agent's current position to the west. The fountain adjacent south. So if the agent can push the western boulder towards the south, that might place it on a fountain.

Wait, the fountain adjacent south is at the agent's current position (37,11). But the agent is a samurai, not a boulder. The boulder needs to be on the fountain. So if the boulder is to the west at (36,11), and the agent can push it south to (36,12), which might be near a fountain. The observation mentions fountain near southsouthwest, which is further south and southwest. Alternatively, the fountain very near south and westsouthwest. Maybe pushing the boulder south-east?

Alternatively, the agent could move south to (37,12) and then try to push the boulder west or south. But there's a bar adjacent northeast, which might be blocking the path. Hmm. The agent's current position is (37,11). The boulder is adjacent west at (36,11). The agent could push the boulder west to (35,11), but then check if there's a fountain there. Alternatively, push the boulder south to (36,11) → (36,12). Is there a fountain at (36,12)? The fountain very near south and westsouthwest. Maybe not directly. Alternatively, pushing the boulder east if possible, but there's a bar there.

Wait, the agent is at (37,11). To push the western boulder, they need to move west into it. But the previous attempt to push west resulted in an error message. Let me check the latest message: ""You cannot pass through the bars."" So maybe the boulder is blocked by a bar. The language observation says bars adjacent north, northeast, east, and northwest. So the agent is surrounded by bars on some sides. That complicates movement.

Wait, the cursor is at (37,11), and the boulder is adjacent west. So the boulder is at (36,11). To push it, the agent needs to move into it. But the agent just tried pushing west and got an error. Maybe because there's a bar in the way. Let me look at the map. The map at (37,11) is marked with #.`@#####, so the agent is in a cell with a bar (.) and possibly other structures. The bars adjacent north, northeast, east, and northwest might be blocking the path to push the boulder.

Alternatively, maybe the boulder is blocked by another obstacle. The agent needs to find a path to maneuver the boulder. Since movement is tricky due to bars, perhaps moving south to (37,12) and then trying to push the boulder east or west. But moving south might be possible if there's no bar. The language observation says bars very near north, northnortheast, northeast, etc., but south might be clearer.

Looking at the latest map, the agent's position is (37,11) with #.`@#####, which might indicate bars around. To the south (37,12), the cell is #..@...<##, which could be a path. So moving south to (37,12) and then trying to push the boulder west towards a fountain.

Alternatively, the agent could move east to (38,11), but there's a bar there. The message says ""You cannot pass through the bars,"" so that's not possible. So the best bet is to move south to (37,12) and see if pushing the boulder from there is possible.

Alternatively, check if there's a fountain nearby that the boulder can be pushed onto. The fountains are at south and westsouthwest. If the agent can move the boulder to (36,12) or (35,12), which might be near a fountain. But without knowing the exact map layout, it's hard to tell.

Given the constraints, the next logical step is to try pushing the western boulder again, but maybe the agent needs to reposition first. Since moving west is blocked by bars, maybe moving south and then attempting to push the boulder west or south.

So the chosen action would be to move south to (37,12), then from there try to push the boulder. But the user is asking for the next action based on the current observation. The current position is (37,11), and the agent tried pushing west but got a bar error. So the immediate next action could be to move south to see if that's possible, then try pushing the boulder from there.

Alternatively, since the agent is at (37,11) and the boulder is at (36,11), maybe pushing the boulder south to (36,12). But the agent would need to move into the boulder's position and push. The action would be ""push south"". However, the previous attempt to push south resulted in a message ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" which means the boulder couldn't be moved, possibly because there's a bar behind it or another obstacle.

Looking at the language observation: bars very near north, northnortheast, northeast, eastnortheast, east, southeast, northwest, and northnorthwest. So the cell to the south of the boulder (36,12) might have a bar, preventing the boulder from being pushed further south.

In that case, perhaps the agent should try pushing the boulder west to (35,11). But to do that, the agent needs to move west into the boulder's current position. However, there's a bar adjacent northwest, which might block that path.

Alternatively, the agent could move north to (37,10), but there's a bar adjacent north, so that's not possible.

Given all this, the most feasible action might be to move south to (37,12) and then attempt to push the boulder west or east from there. Moving south is possible if there's no bar. The map shows at (37,12) as #..@...<##, which might be a walkable path. So the next action should be ""south"" to reposition.

",-0.001,False
63,west,"<reasoning>
Let's see where I am in this Boxoban game. The goal is to push all the boulders onto the fountains. Looking at the current observation:

My position is (37, 12). The boulders are very near southsoutheast and southwest. There's a fountain very near south and west. Also, there's a boulder adjacent to the east and northwest. The cursor is pointing at me as the samurai.

The map shows a lot of bars and dark areas, which I assume are walls or obstacles. Stairs are up near eastsoutheast, but I don't know if I need them yet. The fountains are near the south and west, so maybe the boulders need to be moved there.

Looking at the adjacent boulders: one is to the east and northwest. If there's a boulder to the east, maybe I can push it south towards the fountain. But first, I need to check if there's space behind the boulder. The message says I tried pushing before but couldn't, possibly because there's an obstacle.

The language observation mentions ""fountain adjacent south,"" so the southern direction near me has a fountain. If there's a boulder to the east, pushing it south might place it on the fountain. Alternatively, moving west to a position where I can push a boulder towards the west fountain.

Also, the stairs up are eastsoutheast, but since I'm on the first level and the goal is likely to push boulders here, maybe they're a red herring or for a later level. 

I need to navigate around the bars and dark areas. My current position is at (37,12). If I move south to (37,13), what's there? The map shows some symbols, but it's mostly ########## which might be walls. The previous moves tried east, south, west, but encountered bars or couldn't push. 

The last action was south, which got me to (37,13), but there's a barrier. So maybe I need to go west to (36,13) and then try pushing a boulder east towards the fountain. Alternatively, check the boulder to the east (37,12) and see if I can push it south into the fountain at (37,13) which is adjacent south.

Wait, the fountain is adjacent south, so if I push the boulder from (37,12) east to (38,12), then maybe further south? But the map's southern areas have bars, so maybe the path is blocked. Alternatively, push the boulder west towards the west fountain. The west fountain is very near, so if I can position the boulder there.

But the boulder adjacent northwest might be at (36,11) or similar. Hmm. Maybe I need to move to a position where I can push the boulder in the desired direction. Let me think step by step.

Current position: (37,12). Boulders nearby: east and northwest. Let's focus on the east boulder at (38,12). To push it south, I need to be adjacent to it and the space behind it must be free. If I move east to (38,12), then push south to (38,13). But is there a fountain there? The fountain adjacent south is at (37,13), so maybe pushing the boulder to (38,13) doesn't reach the fountain. Alternatively, push it further south if possible.

Alternatively, the boulder to the northwest is at (36,11) perhaps. If I move west to (36,12) and then north to (36,11), I could push that boulder south towards the west fountain. The west fountain is very near, maybe at (36,13) or similar. So if I can get that boulder to (36,13), it would be on the fountain.

But how to navigate there. Let's see. From (37,12), moving west to (36,12), then south to (36,13). Is that path clear? There are bars near north, northeast, etc., but maybe the path is open. If I can get to (36,13), then if there's a boulder at (36,11), pushing it south to (36,12) and then to (36,13) would place it on the fountain.

Alternatively, check the adjacent boulders again. The message says ""boulder adjacent east and northwest."" So east is (38,12), northwest is (36,11). To push the east boulder, I need to be at (38,11) or (38,13) to push it north or south. Wait, no. To push a boulder east, I need to be west of it and move east into it, then push it east further. But the boulder is at (38,12), adjacent to me at (37,12). So I can push it east to (39,12), but is there space there? The map shows bars far eastnortheast, so maybe that's a wall. So pushing east might not work.

Alternatively, push the boulder south from (38,12) to (38,13). If that space is free, then it would move towards the fountain at (37,13). But the fountain is adjacent south, which is (37,13). So if the boulder is at (38,13), it's not on the fountain. The fountain is at (37,13), so the boulder needs to be there.

Alternatively, maybe the boulder to the northwest at (36,11) can be pushed south to (36,12) and then to (36,13), which is a fountain. So moving to (36,11), push south twice.

But how to get to (36,11). From (37,12), move west to (36,12), then north to (36,11). Is that possible? The map's north area has bars, but perhaps the path is open. Once at (36,11), if there's a boulder, push it south to (36,12), then to (36,13), placing it on the fountain.

This seems like a viable plan. So steps: west to (36,12), north to (36,11), push south twice. But need to check if the moves are allowed.

Alternatively, maybe the boulder adjacent northwest is at (36,12) instead. Need to clarify the positions based on the map.

Looking at the map, the cursor is at (37,12), which is marked with @. The surrounding symbols: to the north is `., to the east is {. So the map's structure is such that moving east from (37,12) would go into the {. which might be a wall or an obstacle.

The bars and dark areas indicate various obstacles. The key is to find a path to a boulder and push it towards a fountain.

Another approach: since the fountain is adjacent south at (37,13), maybe push a boulder there. The boulder adjacent east is at (38,12). If I can move to (38,12) and push it south to (38,13), but that might not reach the fountain. Alternatively, push it west into a position where it can roll south onto the fountain.

Alternatively, the boulder at (36,11) (northwest adjacent) can be pushed south to (36,12), then to (36,13) onto the fountain.

So the plan is: move west to (36,12), then north to (36,11), push south to (36,12), then push south again to (36,13). This would place the boulder on the fountain at (36,13).

But need to ensure that the spaces are clear. The message history shows previous attempts to push resulted in ""vain"" messages, meaning the push wasn't possible due to obstacles behind.

In the latest observation, after moving south to (37,13), there's a barrier (bars), so moving east is blocked. Therefore, perhaps the best move is to go west to (36,12), then check if the path to (36,11) is clear.

From (36,12), moving north to (36,11): is there a boulder there? The boulder adjacent northwest is at (36,11), so yes. Then push it south to (36,12), then to (36,13). If successful, the boulder would be on the fountain at (36,13).

Therefore, the next actions should be:

1. west to (36,12)
2. north to (36,11)
3. push south to (36,12)
4. push south to (36,13)

But the agent needs to output one action at a time. So the first action should be west to move to (36,12).

However, looking at the current cursor position after the last action (south to (37,13)), but the latest observation shows the cursor is back at (37,12) after a defaulted north action. Need to check the history.

Wait, the last few interactions had the user correcting the action to push, but the system defaulted to north. The current observation provided has the cursor at (37,12) with the message about bars far eastnortheast and eastsoutheast.

So the current position is (37,12). Boulders adjacent east and northwest. The fountain is adjacent south at (37,13). The boulder to the east is at (38,12). To push it south, I need to be adjacent to it and have space behind. If I move east to (38,12), then push south to (38,13). But the map shows bars near southsoutheast and southsouthwest, so (38,13) might be blocked. Alternatively, push the boulder west towards the west fountain.

But the west fountain is very near, at (36,13) perhaps. If I can push the boulder from (38,12) west through (37,12) which is occupied by me, that's not possible. So maybe the other boulder to the northwest at (36,11) is a better target.

From (37,12), moving west to (36,12), then north to (36,11) where the boulder is. Once there, push south to (36,12), then again to (36,13) onto the fountain.

So the immediate action should be west to (36,12).

64,push south,"<reasoning>
Let's take a look at the current situation in Boxoban. The agent is at position (36, 12). The goal is to push the boulders onto the fountains. The map has some bars, dark areas, stairs up, and the agent's equipment.

First, I need to check the observations. There are boulders near east, southeast, and southsouthwest. The fonts are adjacent to south and west. The cursor (agent) is at (36,12). The previous attempts to push the boulders resulted in messages saying ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain,"" which means there might be an obstacle behind the boulders or the boulder is not adjacent in the right direction.

Looking at the map, the agent is facing a wall of bars to the east. So pushing east isn't possible. The adjacent boulders are to the east and northwest. The fountain is adjacent to the south. The agent was trying to push south before but encountered bars. Maybe the boulder is blocked by something else.

Wait, in the current observation, the boulder is adjacent east and northwest. The agent is at (36,12). So to the east is the boulder, and to the northwest is another boulder. The fountain is to the south. So maybe the agent needs to move the boulder to the south. But the agent is already facing south. Let me check the map again.

The map shows the agent's position as @{...<##, so the '<' indicates the direction the agent is facing. If the agent is facing south, then pushing the boulder south would require the boulder to be north of the agent. But according to the current boulder positions, there's a boulder adjacent east (which is north of the agent if facing south). Wait, no, positions are (x,y), so moving south increases y. So if the agent is at (36,12) facing south, the boulder adjacent east would be at (37,12), which is east, not north. The boulder adjacent northwest is at (35,11), perhaps.

Hmm, maybe the agent should move west to get next to the boulder. The agent is at (36,12). Moving west to (35,12) would place them next to the boulder at (35,11) if that's the northwest direction. Wait, maybe the boulder is at (35,12) northwest of the agent? Or perhaps the boulder is at (36,11) if it's northwest. This is a bit confusing with the map orientation.

Alternatively, since the agent is trying to push the boulder south towards the fountain, but the bars are blocking the way. The message says ""You cannot pass through the bars,"" so the path must be blocked. Maybe the boulder needs to be moved to a different direction where the path is clear.

Looking at the language observation, there's a fountain adjacent to the south. The agent is at (36,12), so the south direction is y=13. The fountain is there. If there's a boulder adjacent east (which is at (37,12)), pushing that boulder south to (37,13) would place it on the fountain. But the bars are far eastnortheast and eastsoutheast, so moving east might be blocked by bars. The agent tried to push east before but got a message saying they can't pass through bars. So maybe the boulder is adjacent east, and pushing it south is possible if the path is clear.

Wait, the agent is at (36,12). If they push the boulder east (to (37,12)), but there's a bar in the way, that's not possible. Alternatively, if the boulder is to the northwest, maybe pushing it south would work. But the agent needs to position themselves next to the correct boulder.

Given that the previous attempts to push resulted in failure, perhaps the agent needs to reposition. Moving west to (35,12) might bring them next to the boulder at (35,11) (northwest direction) so they can push it south to (35,12) but that's not a fountain. The fountain is at south, which is (36,13). Alternatively, the boulder adjacent east (37,12) needs to be pushed south to (37,13), which is adjacent to the fountain. But the bars are near east, so moving east might not be allowed. The agent tried to move east before and got a ""cannot pass"" message, so pushing the boulder east is blocked.

Alternatively, maybe the agent should move south to (36,13) and then push the boulder west or east. But the fountain is at south, so perhaps pushing a boulder there. The current boulders are at southsoutheast and southwest. Maybe the agent needs to push the one at southeast to the fountain.

Alternatively, looking at the map, the agent's position is #{.@`#####, so the '.' might indicate the floor. The '<' is the agent's facing direction. If facing south, moving south would go into the bars, which is blocked. So the agent should try to move west to get next to the boulder. Let's see, moving west to (35,12) and then pushing the boulder there. If the boulder is at (35,12) northwest of the agent, then pushing it south to (35,13) might place it on a fountain if that's the case. But the fountain is adjacent south, which is (36,13). Hmm.

Alternatively, the boulder adjacent east (37,12) needs to be pushed south to (37,13) towards the fountain. But the agent is at (36,12), so pushing that boulder would require being next to it. The agent is one tile west of it. So moving east to (37,12) would place them next to the boulder, but the message says they can't pass through bars when moving east. So perhaps there's a bar at (37,12), blocking the agent's movement there. Therefore, they can't get next to the boulder to push it.

This is tricky. Maybe the agent needs to find another path. Looking at the map, there's a staircase up near eastsoutheast, but that's probably not useful here. The key is to get the boulder onto the fountain. The fountain is at southsouthwest and west. The agent is at (36,12). The boulder very near southsoutheast and southwest might be the one to target.

Wait, the language observation says ""boulder very near southsoutheast and southwest."" So maybe there's a boulder at (36,13) southeast and (35,12) southwest. If the agent moves south to (36,13), which is adjacent to the fountain, perhaps they can push a boulder there. But the agent is already at (36,12), south of which is (36,13). If there's a boulder at (36,13), they can push it west or east. But the current observations don't show a boulder at (36,13). The boulders are east, southeast, and southsouthwest.

Alternatively, the boulder adjacent east (37,12) needs to be pushed south to (37,13), which is adjacent to the fountain at south. So the agent needs to get next to that boulder. But moving east to (37,12) is blocked by bars. Therefore, the agent can't reach it. Maybe they need to move around the bars.

Alternatively, the agent could move north to (36,11) and then try a different direction. But the previous observations don't show obstacles there. However, the agent's goal is to push the boulder onto the fountain, so the priority is to maneuver the boulder correctly.

Given the confusion in map orientation and the previous failures, the safest bet might be to try pushing the boulder west, assuming it's near the northwest direction. The agent is at (36,12). If there's a boulder at (35,12), pushing it west to (34,12) might not help. Alternatively, pushing it south to (35,13) if that's a fountain.

Alternatively, the agent should move west to (35,12) and then push the boulder there. But without knowing the exact positions, it's hard to say. Given the previous attempts to push resulted in failure, maybe the agent needs to reposition. The correct action here is to attempt to push the boulder in a direction that leads it to the fountain, considering the barriers. Since the fountain is south, pushing a boulder from the north towards the south would be ideal. But the agent is blocked by bars to the east. So maybe pushing a boulder from the west or north.

After analyzing, the best action is to move west to get next to the boulder and then push it south towards the fountain.

I need to figure out how to solve this Boxoban puzzle. The goal is to push all the boulders onto the fountains. Looking at the current observations, the agent is at (36,12). The map has various bars, dark areas, and objects. There's a boulder adjacent to the northwest direction. The fountains are nearby, so maybe the boulder needs to be moved towards one of them.

The previous attempts to push the boulder didn't work because either it wasn't possible or there was an obstacle. The latest attempt was pushing south, but the message said it failed. Let me check the map again. The cursor is at (36,12), and the boulder is adjacent to the northwest. Wait, the boulder's position might be at (35,11) or similar. To push it south, the agent would need to be north of the boulder and then push it south. But if the agent is at (36,12), maybe the boulder is to the west or north.

Looking at the map, there's a `<` symbol at (36,12) which represents the agent. The boulder is adjacent northeast and southeast. So maybe the boulder is at (37,13) or (35,11). The fountains are adjacent to the south, so perhaps the boulder needs to be pushed towards the fountain at (37,13). 

Wait, the latest cursor position is (36,12), and the boulder adjacent northeast and southeast. If the agent is at (36,12), moving west to (35,12) might position them to push the boulder east. Alternatively, moving north to (36,11) could allow pushing the boulder south. But the message when trying to push south before said it failed. Maybe there's a bar in the way or the boulder can't be moved in that direction because there's an obstacle behind it.

Another approach: check the surroundings. The bars are very near north, northeast, etc. So maybe pushing the boulder towards the southeast where there's a fountain. If the boulder is at (37,13), pushing it south to (37,14) where there's a fountain might work. But the agent needs to be in the correct position. Let's see: if the agent is at (37,13), pushing east might not help. Alternatively, moving the agent to (37,12) and then pushing east? 

Wait, the agent was at (37,13) previously. Maybe the boulder is there. If the agent moves east to (38,13), then they can push the boulder south to (38,14) if that's a valid spot with a fountain. But looking at the map, there are a lot of ########## which might represent walls or bars. The agent can't go through those. 

Alternatively, maybe the boulder needs to be moved west towards the fountain adjacent to the northwest. If the boulder is at (35,11), pushing it east to (36,11) where there's a fountain. But the agent is currently at (36,12), so moving north to (36,11) and then pushing east. 

The key is to determine the exact positions of the boulder and fountains. The fountains are adjacent to the south, so perhaps pushing the boulder south into that position. But previous attempts to push south didn't work, which might mean there's a bar or another obstacle in that direction. 

Wait, the latest message after trying to push south says ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" So maybe the boulder is blocked by a bar or another object. Looking at the language observation, there are bars very near north, northeast, etc. So the path to push the boulder south might be blocked by a bar. 

In that case, the agent needs to find an alternative path. Maybe move around the boulder and then push it in a direction where there's no obstacle. For example, if the boulder is at (37,13), moving the agent to (37,12) and then pushing west? Or moving west to (35,12) and pushing the boulder east? 

Alternatively, check if there's a fountain in another direction. The fountains are also adjacent to the southeast and northwest. If the boulder can be pushed east into the southeast fountain, that would work. But the agent needs to position themselves correctly. 

Another thing to consider is the agent's inventory. They have a katana, wakizashi, yumi, and ya arrows. But since it's a box-pushing game, using weapons might not be necessary. The main action is moving and pushing boulders. 

Given all this, the best immediate action might be to move the agent closer to the boulder in a direction that allows pushing it towards a fountain without obstacles. For example, if the boulder is at (37,13), the agent could move west to (36,13) and then try pushing east towards a fountain. Alternatively, move north to (36,11) and push south if that's clear. 

But based on the latest cursor position at (36,12) and the boulder adjacent northeast and southeast, perhaps the agent should move north to (36,11) and then push south towards the fountain. However, the previous attempt to push south from there failed, so maybe there's a bar in the way. 

Looking at the map, the bars are very near north, northnortheast, etc. So pushing the boulder south from (36,12) might be blocked by a bar at (36,13). In that case, the agent needs to find a way around. Maybe move west to (35,12) and then push the boulder east. 

Alternatively, check if the boulder can be pushed west into the northwest fountain. If the boulder is at (35,11), pushing it west to (34,11) where there's a fountain. But the agent needs to be positioned to the east of the boulder. 

In conclusion, the next best move is to position the agent next to the boulder in a direction where pushing it towards a fountain is possible without obstacles. Given the current position and the boulder's location, moving west to (35,12) and then pushing east towards the southeast fountain might be the way to go. However, if that's blocked, try a different direction. 

Since the agent is at (36,12) and the boulder is adjacent northeast and southeast, moving north to (36,11) and then pushing east? Or moving west to (35,12) and pushing east. The exact position of the boulder needs to be confirmed. 

Another possibility: the boulder is at (37,13), adjacent to the southeast. The agent is at (36,12), so moving east to (37,12) and then pushing south to (37,13) into the fountain. But if there's a bar at (37,13), that won't work. 

Given the uncertainty, the safest action might be to move the agent closer to the boulder in a cardinal direction and then attempt a valid push. For example, move west to (35,12) and then push east if possible.

Let's see. I need to push a boulder onto a fountain in Boxoban. Let's look at the current state.

The agent is at (35,12). The map shows several boulders and fountains. The nearest boulder is adjacent to the northeast. There's a fountain to the eastsoutheast and southeast. The bars and dark areas are blocking some paths. 

The previous attempts to push the boulder to the south didn't work because maybe there was something blocking it. Now, checking the map, the agent is at (35,12). The boulder is to the northeast. To push it towards a fountain, maybe move east first to get closer. 

The fountain is at eastsoutheast. If I can push the boulder east from (35,12), then maybe to (36,12), then (37,12), but there are bars nearby. Wait, looking at the language observation, there are bars very near north, northnortheast, northeast, southsouthwest, and northnorthwest. So pushing east might be possible if the path is clear. 

The boulder adjacent northeast means it's one tile away to the northeast. So from (35,12), moving east to (36,12), then pushing the boulder east to (37,12). But need to check if there's a space behind the boulder. The message said ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" earlier, which might mean the boulder was blocked. So maybe the boulder is against a wall or another obstacle. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to move around to the side of the boulder. Since the boulder is to the northeast, moving north or south might allow a better push. But the dark areas might be walls. 

Wait, the stairs up are near eastsoutheast, which is a different direction. The fountains are at eastsoutheast and southeast. The current boulder is near east, eastsoutheast. Maybe the agent should push the boulder towards the southeast fountain. 

Let me try to visualize the map. The agent is at (35,12). To the east is (36,12), which has a boulder adjacent. If I move east to (36,12), then push the boulder south or east. But the fountain is to the southeast. So pushing the boulder southeast from (36,12) would place it at (36,13), which is adjacent to the southeast fountain. 

But looking at the language observation, there's a dark area very near southwest, west, and northwest. So moving west from (35,12) might hit a wall. Maybe the agent should move east to get next to the boulder. 

So the plan: move east to (36,12), then push the boulder southeast towards the fountain. But need to check if the path is clear. The bars are near eastnortheast and east, so maybe the path east is blocked by bars. 

Alternatively, maybe the boulder is at (36,11) or (37,12). If the agent moves east to (36,12) and then pushes the boulder south to (36,13), which is near the fountain. But the previous attempts to push south didn't work because the boulder was blocked. 

Wait, the current cursor is at (35,12). The boulder is adjacent northeast, so it's at (36,13) or (35,13). If the agent moves east to (36,12), then pushes the boulder south to (36,13), that might reach the fountain at (36,14)? Not sure. Alternatively, push the boulder east to (37,12), which is towards the southeast fountain. 

But the bars are very near north, northnortheast, northeast, southsouthwest, and northnorthwest. So pushing east from (36,12) might hit a bar. 

Hmm. Maybe the best move is to move east to get next to the boulder and then try pushing it east again. Even if it hits a bar, maybe the previous attempts didn't position the boulder correctly. 

Alternatively, since the agent is at (35,12), moving north might clear a path. But the dark area is near north and northeast. 

Alternatively, check the map again. The agent's position is marked with @. The boulder is adjacent northeast, so maybe it's at (36,13). To push it towards the fountain at southeast, which is (37,14) or similar. Not sure. 

Alternatively, the fountain very near eastsoutheast and southeast. So if the boulder can be pushed to (37,13), that might be near a fountain. 

Given the previous failed attempts, maybe the agent needs to reposition. Move east to (36,12), then push the boulder south to (36,13), then east to (37,13). 

But given the bars, maybe the path east is blocked. The language observation says bars very near north, northnortheast, northeast, southsouthwest, and northnorthwest. So pushing east from (36,12) might hit a bar at (37,12). 

In that case, perhaps the correct action is to move north to (35,11) and try pushing the boulder in another direction. 

Alternatively, since the agent is at (35,12), moving west to (34,12) might avoid the boulder and find another path. 

But the goal is to push a boulder onto a fountain. Let's focus on the boulder adjacent northeast. If the agent moves east to (36,12), then pushes the boulder south to (36,13), which is a direction towards the southeast fountain. 

Even though the previous attempts failed, maybe the correct sequence is to get next to the boulder and push it in the right direction. 

So the next action should be to move east to get next to the boulder, then push it south or east. 

The current cursor is at (35,12). Moving east to (36,12). Then push south to (36,13). 

But need to check if the path is clear. The language observation says bars very near northeast, etc. So pushing south from (36,12) might be possible if there's no barrier. 

Alternatively, maybe the boulder is blocked by a bar. 

Given the uncertainty, the best immediate action is to move east to get next to the boulder and then try pushing it in the direction of the fountain.

The agent needs to solve Boxoban by pushing boulders onto fountains. Let's analyze the current situation.

From the map, the agent's position is (36, 12). The boulders are adjacent north and west of the agent. The fountains are southeast and west. The agent tried pushing south earlier but failed, probably because there's an obstacle behind the boulder. The message says ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain,"" which might mean the boulder is blocked by another obstacle like bars or another boulder.

Looking at the language observation, there are bars very near north, northeast, etc. So moving north might not be possible due to bars. The agent is at (36,12). The boulder to the north is at (36,11). To push it south, the agent needs to move north into the boulder, then the boulder would move to (36,11). But if there's a bar or another obstacle at (36,11), that won't work. The map shows a `#` at (36,11), which is a wall or bar, making it impossible to push the boulder south into that spot. 

Alternatively, the boulder to the west is at (35,12). To push that east, the agent needs to move west into it. But the agent just moved west to (35,12) and then east back. Maybe there's a way to position the agent to push the western boulder towards a fountain. The fountain adjacent to the agent is to the southeast and west. If the agent can push the western boulder towards the west fountain, that would solve the level.

So, the best action is to push the boulder west. Wait, but the agent is already at (36,12), and the western boulder is at (35,12). So the agent needs to move west into the boulder. That would push the boulder to (34,12), but is there a fountain there? The fountains are at south and west. The west fountain is adjacent, so if the boulder is pushed all the way to the west fountain, that would be a solution. 

But the current cursor position after the last action was (35,12) when the agent moved west. Then moving east brings back to (36,12). So the boulder west is at (35,12). The agent should push west into that boulder. The action would be ""push west"". Let's check if that's possible. The message after trying to push south before said it failed, but that was because of the bar. Pushing west might work if there's no obstacle behind the boulder. 

Looking at the language observation, bars are very near north, northeast, etc., but not specifically blocking (34,12). The west fountain is adjacent, so pushing the boulder west into the fountain would solve the problem. Therefore, the correct action is to push west.

Let's try to figure out how to solve this Boxoban level. I'm standing at position (36, 12) looking at the map. The goal is to push all the boulders onto the fountains. Looking at the current observations, there's a boulder adjacent to the north. My last attempt to push it west failed because maybe there's an obstacle in the way or I'm not positioned correctly.

First, I need to check the map again. The map shows a lot of bars and dark areas, which might be walls or obstacles. The boulder is north of me, so maybe I need to move closer to it. But wait, when I tried pushing west earlier, it didn't work, perhaps because the boulder is blocked by something else. Let me check the language observations again.

The language observation mentions that bars are very near north, northnortheast, northeast, eastnortheast, southwest, westsouthwest, west, westnorthwest, and northnorthwest. So there are walls or barriers in those directions. The boulder is adjacent north, so it's right above me. The fountain is adjacent southeast and west, which means there's a fountain to the southeast and west of my current position.

To push the boulder north, I need to make sure there's no obstacle behind it. Let me see. The boulder is north, and if I push it north, it should go towards the fountain. But if there's a wall or another obstacle north of the boulder, I can't push it further. The map shows that bars are very near north and northnortheast, so maybe pushing the boulder north would be into a bar, which is impossible. Wait, the boulder is adjacent north, so if I push it north, it would move into a position where there's a bar, making it impossible. Therefore, I can't push the boulder north directly because there's a barrier there.

Maybe I need to move around to a different position where I can push the boulder towards a fountain without hitting a wall. Let's check the fountains. There's a fountain adjacent southeast and west. If I can get the boulder to move southwest or west, maybe onto one of those fountains. But how?

Looking at the cursor position, I'm at (36, 12). The boulder is north, so at (36, 11) perhaps. To push it west, I need to be next to it and push towards west. Wait, I tried pushing west before, but it didn't work. Maybe I'm not positioned correctly. Let me think: if the boulder is north of me, my position is (36,12), and the boulder is at (36,11). To push the boulder west, I need to be at (36,11) and push west to (35,11). But am I next to the boulder? If the boulder is adjacent north, then yes, it's directly above me. So to push it west, I need to be on the same row or column as the boulder and push in the direction away from the obstacle.

Wait, the boulder is adjacent north, so it's one square above me. To push it west, I need to be next to it on the west side. But if I'm at (36,12), the boulder is at (36,11). The west direction from the boulder would be (35,11). So I need to be at (36,11) to push it west. But I'm currently at (36,12). So perhaps I need to move north first to get to (36,11) where the boulder is, then push west. Let me check if moving north is possible.

Looking at the language observation, bars are very near north. So moving north from (36,12) would take me to (36,11), but is there a bar there? The bars are very near north, so maybe the square north of me is blocked. If that's the case, I can't move north. So that's a problem. If I can't move north to get to the boulder, I need another way.

Alternatively, maybe the boulder is blocked by a bar on the west side. If I can't push it north or west because of bars, perhaps I need to find another boulder. Wait, the current observation mentions a boulder adjacent north and another very near east, southeast, and southsouthwest. So there are multiple boulders. The primary one is north, but maybe the others can be moved to fountains.

But the immediate goal is to move the boulder north. Since pushing it north is blocked by bars, perhaps I should try to move it west or east. But east is also blocked by bars. Wait, the boulder is adjacent north. Let me visualize the area around me. My position is (36,12). The boulder is at (36,11). To push it west, I need to be at (36,11) and push west to (35,11). But is there a barrier at (35,11)? The language observation says bars are very near north, northnortheast, northeast, eastnortheast, southwest, westsouthwest, west, westnorthwest, and northnorthwest. So (35,11) is west of the boulder, which is at (36,11). The west direction from (36,11) would be (35,11). Are there bars there? The ""bars very near west"" might include that area. If there's a bar at (35,11), I can't push the boulder west.

Alternatively, maybe the boulder can be pushed south. If I can push it south towards the fountain adjacent southeast and west. Let's see. The boulder is at (36,11). To push it south, I need to be at (36,11) and push it to (36,12), which is my current position. But that would move the boulder into my space, which I can't do because I can't be in the same space as a boulder unless I'm pushing it. Wait, no. When you push a boulder, you move into the square the boulder was in, and the boulder moves into the next square. So if I'm at (36,12) and the boulder is at (36,11), I can push it south to (36,10), but only if (36,10) is not blocked.

But looking at the map, there are bars very near north, so (36,10) might be a bar. The language observation says bars are very near north, so maybe (36,10) is blocked. Therefore, pushing the boulder south isn't possible either.

Hmm, this is tricky. All directions seem blocked. Maybe I need to move around to a different side. Let me check the other boulders. There's a boulder very near east, southeast, and southsouthwest. Maybe I can focus on moving that one. Let's see. If I move east, perhaps I can get closer to that boulder.

From my current position (36,12), moving east would take me to (37,12). The language observation mentions bars very near east, so maybe that's blocked. Alternatively, there's a fountain very near south and west. If I can move the boulder adjacent north onto one of those fountains, that would solve the level.

Wait, the fountain adjacent southeast and west. My current position is (36,12). The southeast fountain would be at (37,13), and the west fountain at (35,12). The boulder is at (36,11). If I could push it southwest to (35,12), that's where the fountain is. But how?

To push the boulder southwest, I need to be to the northeast of it. So I need to move to (35,11) to push it southwest to (34,10). But again, checking the bars, (35,11) might be blocked. This is getting complicated. Maybe I need to try different moves.

Alternatively, since pushing the boulder north is impossible due to bars, perhaps I should move to the west or east to find a path. Let me try moving west again. From (36,12) to (35,12). The language observation says there's a boulder adjacent north, but moving west, is that path clear? The bars are very near west, but maybe the path is open. If I can move west, I can then try to navigate around the boulder.

Wait, moving west from (36,12) to (35,12). The language observation mentions that the boulder is adjacent north, so the square (35,12) is west of me. There's a fountain adjacent west, which is at (35,12). So perhaps that's a fountain. If I can move the boulder onto that fountain, that would be good. But how?

The boulder is at (36,11). To get it to (35,12), I need to push it diagonally? No, you can only push boulders orthogonally (up, down, left, right). So diagonal movements aren't allowed. Therefore, the boulder at (36,11) can't be moved directly to (35,12). It would need to be moved in straight lines.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the boulder east. But east is blocked by bars. This is really frustrating. Maybe I need to look for other boulders. The other boulder is very near east, southeast, and southsouthwest. Let's say it's at (37,13) or similar. If I can move that one onto a fountain, that might help. But how to reach it?

From my current position (36,12), moving east to (37,12) is blocked by bars. So maybe I need to go around. If I move south to (36,13), then east to (37,13), perhaps. But I need to check if those paths are clear.

The language observation says dark area near southeast, south, southwest, west, and northwest. So moving south to (36,13) might be possible if there's no bar there. The bars are very near north, so (36,13) might be safe. Let me try moving south.

Once I'm at (36,13), I can then move east to (37,13), which is where the other boulder might be. If I can get next to that boulder, I can push it towards the fountain very near southsoutheast. But this is all speculative based on the map's layout.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial approach was wrong. Since the boulder adjacent north can't be moved north or west due to bars, maybe the solution is to push it south into a different position. But as observed earlier, pushing south might be blocked.

Wait, the boulder is at (36,11). If I push it south to (36,10), but is that square clear? The language observation mentions bars very near north, so (36,10) might be a bar. Therefore, pushing south isn't possible.

This seems like a dead end. Maybe I need to explore the map more. The map has a staircase up near eastsoutheast. Maybe going upstairs would change the level, but the goal is to push boulders on this level. So probably not helpful.

Another thought: maybe the boulder adjacent north is already on a fountain. Let me check the language observation. It says fountain adjacent southeast and west. So my current position has a fountain to the west (35,12) and southeast (37,13). The boulder at (36,11) is north of me. If there's a fountain north of that boulder, then pushing it north onto the fountain would solve it. But the language observation doesn't mention a fountain north of the boulder. It only mentions fountains adjacent southeast and west of my current position.

Therefore, the boulder north is not on a fountain. I need to get it there. But how?

Perhaps I need to move around to the side of the boulder and push it in a direction that leads to a fountain. Since pushing north and west are blocked, maybe pushing east or south. But east is blocked by bars, and south might be blocked as well.

Wait, the boulder is at (36,11). If I could push it east to (37,11), but east is blocked by bars. So that's not possible. What about pushing it south to (36,12), which is my current position? That would require me to be at (36,11) to push it south. But I'm at (36,12). So I need to move north to (36,11) first, but north is blocked by bars. Therefore, it's impossible.

This is really confusing. Maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the map. Let me look again at the map provided:

The map is mostly filled with ##########, which probably represents walls or obstacles. There's a section at the bottom with #@..`##### which might be the starting position. The cursor is at (36,12), which is near the bottom right of the map.

Given the complexity, perhaps the best action is to try moving in a different direction that might lead to a viable path. Since pushing the boulder isn't working, maybe moving to a different location to reposition.

I'll try moving west again to (35,12) and see if that's possible. The language observation mentions bars very near west, but maybe the path is clear. If I can move west, then perhaps I can find a way to interact with the boulder or another boulder.

So the chosen action would be west.

",-0.001,False
69,south,"<reasoning>
Let's see. The agent is trying to push a boulder into a fountain in this Boxoban-like game. The observations from the previous steps show that the boulder is adjacent to the agent in some positions, but moving it hasn't worked yet. The latest observation shows the agent is at (35, 12), and the boulder is adjacent to the northeast. The message says ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" which indicates that the last push attempt wasn't possible, probably because there's something blocking the boulder's path behind it.

Looking at the map layout, there are a lot of bars and dark areas, which might be walls or obstacles. The agent needs to position themselves so that they can push the boulder in the right direction towards a fountain. The current position of the agent is west of where the boulder is. So maybe the agent needs to move closer to the boulder to push it. But in the last step, the agent moved west to (35,12), and the boulder is adjacent northeast. So perhaps the agent needs to move north or south to get a better angle. Alternatively, check if there's a clear path behind the boulder where it can be pushed. The fountain is near southsoutheast and west, according to the language observation. So the goal is to push the boulder towards those areas.

Wait, the latest cursor position is (35,12), and the boulder is adjacent northeast. That means the boulder is at (36,11) or (36,13), maybe? Depending on the direction. If the agent is at (35,12), then northeast would be moving to (36,13). If the boulder is there, then pushing west would be the direction. But the previous attempts to push west didn't work because the message says ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" which might mean there's an obstacle behind the boulder. So maybe the boulder is stuck against another wall or obstacle, making it impossible to push further in that direction. Therefore, the agent needs to find a way to maneuver the boulder around the obstacles. Perhaps moving the agent to a position where they can push the boulder in a different direction, like south or north, if there's a clear path.

Looking at the map, there are a lot of '#' which might represent walls or obstacles. The agent is surrounded by bars and dark areas, so movement is limited. The stairs up are near eastsoutheast, but that's probably not relevant right now. The key is to get the boulder to a fountain. The fountains are near south and west, according to the language observation. So maybe the boulder needs to be pushed south towards the fountain there.

The agent is at (35,12). If the boulder is at (36,13) (northeast of agent), then pushing south would be towards (36,14). But the map shows that area might be blocked by bars or walls. Alternatively, if the boulder is at (36,11) (south of agent?), then pushing north could move it towards the fountain. Wait, the language observation says ""boulder very near southsoutheast and southwest"". Maybe the boulder is in the southsoutheast area. The agent needs to navigate to that area and push it towards the fountain.

Alternatively, perhaps the agent needs to move east to get closer to the boulder. But moving east from (35,12) would take the agent to (36,12), which might be blocked by bars. The previous observations show that moving east resulted in ""You cannot pass through the bars."" So east is blocked. Therefore, the agent needs to find another path. Maybe moving north or south. If the agent moves north to (35,11), perhaps there's a clear path. Then, from there, they can try pushing the boulder in a different direction.

But in the latest observation, after moving west to (35,12), the boulder is adjacent northeast. So the agent is west of the boulder. To push the boulder west, the agent would need to be to the north or south of it. If the agent is west, pushing west would require the boulder to move west, but the agent is already west of it. So perhaps the agent needs to move north or south to get to a position where they can push the boulder west or another direction.

Given that the agent is at (35,12) and the boulder is at (36,13) (northeast), the agent could move north to (35,11) and then try pushing the boulder west. Or move south to (35,13) and try pushing north. Alternatively, check if there's a path behind the boulder. If the boulder is at (36,13), pushing it west would require the space at (35,13) to be free. But if there's a wall or another obstacle there, then it can't be pushed. The language observation mentions ""bars very near north, northnortheast, northeast, southsouthwest, and northnorthwest"", which might be around that area. So maybe pushing the boulder west isn't possible because there's a bar in the way.

In that case, the agent might need to find another way to move the boulder. Perhaps by pushing it south towards the fountain at southsoutheast. If the boulder is at (36,13), pushing it south to (36,14) could get it closer to the fountain. But the map might have obstacles there. The agent would need to check the surrounding areas for clear paths.

Another possibility is that the agent needs to interact with the environment differently, but the available actions are only movement. So the best bet is to continue trying to push the boulder in directions where there's a clear path. Since previous attempts to push west didn't work, maybe trying to push south or north.

Looking at the cursor position and the boulder's location, the agent is at (35,12), boulder at (36,13). If the agent moves north to (35,11), then they can try pushing the boulder west. But wait, the agent is west of the boulder, so to push west, the boulder needs to move west, which would require the agent to be north or south of it. If the agent is north of the boulder, then pushing west would move the boulder west. So moving the agent to (35,11) (north of boulder at 36,13) and then pushing west. But need to confirm the coordinates.

Alternatively, maybe the agent should move east to (36,12), but that's blocked by bars. So that's not possible. The only available moves are north, south, west, or east, but east is blocked. So the agent can move north, south, or west. Wait, in the latest observation, the agent is at (35,12), and moving west again would take them to (34,12), but previous steps might have allowed that. But need to check if that's blocked.

Given the complexity, the safest approach is to try pushing the boulder in the direction where there's a clear path towards a fountain. Since the fountain is near southsoutheast, maybe pushing the boulder south. To do that, the agent would need to position themselves south of the boulder. If the agent moves south to (35,13), then they can try pushing the boulder north or south. Alternatively, if the agent is at (35,12) and the boulder is at (36,13), moving south to (35,13) and then pushing south. But need to check if the path behind the boulder is clear.

Another consideration is that the agent's previous attempts to push resulted in ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain,"" which suggests that there's an obstacle behind the boulder. So the boulder is blocked by something, making it impossible to push further in that direction. Therefore, the agent needs to find a way to move the boulder around the obstacle, perhaps by pushing it in a perpendicular direction.

In summary, the agent needs to:

1. Locate the boulder's position relative to themselves.
2. Determine a direction to push the boulder towards a fountain.
3. Ensure there's a clear path behind the boulder in that direction.
4. Move the agent into a position where they can push the boulder.

Given the current position and the obstacles, the best action might be to move north or south to get a better angle and then push the boulder west or south. However, since east is blocked, the agent has limited movement options. The latest attempt to push west didn't work, so maybe trying a different direction. If the agent moves north to (35,11), they can then try pushing the boulder west towards the fountain near south. Alternatively, moving south to (35,13) and pushing south towards the fountain at southsoutheast.

Given the uncertainty, the next action could be to move north and then attempt to push west. Alternatively, move south and push south. Let's check the map layout again. The map shows a lot of '#' which are likely walls. The agent is at (35,12), and the boulder is northeast at (36,13). The area to the south of the boulder (36,14) might be blocked by bars or walls. The fountain is near southsoutheast, which is probably in the direction of increasing x and y. So pushing the boulder south-east might be the way, but the agent needs to position accordingly.

Alternatively, since the boulder is adjacent northeast, the agent could move north to (35,11) and then try pushing the boulder west. That would require the agent to be north of the boulder, allowing them to push it west. If that path is clear, then this could work. The language observation mentions ""bars very near north, northnortheast, northeast, southsouthwest, and northnorthwest"", which might be around the area north of the boulder. So pushing west from there might be possible if the space to the west of the boulder is clear.

Therefore, the chosen action would be to move north to (35,11) and then push west. But since the agent needs to output a single action, the immediate action is to move north first. However, the user is asking for the next action given the current observation, which is at (35,12) with the boulder adjacent northeast. The current cursor is at (35,12), and the previous action was west, leading here. The agent needs to decide between moving further west, north, south, or east (but east is blocked). 

Given the previous pushes didn't work, perhaps the agent should try pushing the boulder south. To do that, the agent would need to be south of the boulder. If the agent moves south to (35,13), then they can push the boulder north or south. But the boulder is at (36,13), so the agent being at (35,13) would be south of it. Pushing south would take the boulder to (36,14). The language observation mentions ""bars near ... south, southsoutheast, ..."", so maybe that area is blocked. Alternatively, pushing north from (35,13) would take the boulder to (36,12), which might be clear.

But without knowing the exact layout, it's challenging. The safest bet might be to try pushing the boulder west again, but from a different position. Since the agent is at (35,12), moving north to (35,11) and then trying to push west. However, the immediate next action should be either north, south, west, or east. Since east is blocked, the options are north, south, or west. 

Looking at the language observation, there are bars very near north, northnortheast, etc. So moving north might be blocked. Therefore, perhaps moving south to (35,13) and then attempting to push the boulder north or south. Alternatively, since the agent is already west of the boulder, pushing west isn't possible unless there's a clear path. Maybe the agent needs to move north to get around the obstacle behind the boulder.

In conclusion, the agent's next action should be to move north to (35,11) to get a better angle and then attempt to push the boulder west. But since the agent can only perform one action at a time, the immediate action is to move north. Alternatively, if moving north is blocked, then try moving south. Given the previous messages about bars, moving north might not be possible. Therefore, the agent should try moving south to (35,13) and then push the boulder north or south.

Let's see. The goal is to push the boulders onto the fountains. From the observations, there's a boulder near eastnortheast and eastsoutheast. Also, there are fountains near east, eastsoutheast, and southsoutheast. The agent is at position (35,13). Let's check the map.

Looking at the cursor position and the map layout, the agent is facing south now. The boulder is to the northeast and eastsoutheast. Since the agent is at (35,13), moving south would take them further away from the boulder. Maybe they need to move east or west to get closer to the boulder.

Wait, the boulder is very near northnortheast. So the agent is at (35,13). Northnortheast would be up and to the left. Let me think. If the agent moves north, they can head towards the boulder. But the previous actions tried moving east and west, but there are bars blocking. So perhaps pushing the boulder towards a fountain.

The fountains are in the east, eastsoutheast, and southsoutheast. If the boulder can be pushed southeast towards the fountain, that would be good. The agent is at (35,13). To push the boulder east or southeast, they need to approach it. But the agent's current position is (35,13), and the boulder is near eastnortheast. So moving east might get closer.

But earlier attempts to push east resulted in messages about bars blocking. Wait, the latest observation says bars very near southeast, southsouthwest, and northnorthwest. So maybe the path is blocked. The agent needs to navigate around the bars to reach the boulder.

Alternatively, maybe the boulder is adjacent to the agent. Let me check the latest language observation. ""boulder adjacent southwest, west, and northwest."" Wait, the cursor is at (35,13). If the boulder is adjacent southwest, that would be at (34,12). But the agent is at (35,13). To push the boulder southwest, they would need to be next to it. But the boulder is adjacent southwest, so maybe the agent can move west to be next to it and then push west or south.

Wait, the message says ""boulder adjacent southwest, west, and northwest."" So the boulder is next to those directions. The agent is at (35,13). If the boulder is adjacent southwest, that would be position (34,12). To get there, the agent would need to move west twice. But earlier moves to west got them to (36,12) and then (35,12). Wait, no, let me track the history.

Earlier actions: The agent moved east, south, west, east, then tried pushing east (invalid), then south, west, etc. Now the cursor is at (35,12) after moving west. Then moved south to (35,13). The latest observation says the boulder is adjacent southwest, west, and northwest. So the boulder is near (34,12), (34,13), and (34,14). The agent is at (35,13). If the boulder is adjacent southwest (34,12), then the agent can move west to (34,13) and then push west to (33,13) if there's a path. But need to check if the path is clear.

Alternatively, maybe the boulder is at (35,14) (southwest adjacent). Then the agent can move south to (35,14) and push west. But the agent is currently at (35,13). Moving south to (35,14) and then check if the boulder is there. But the latest message says the boulder is adjacent southwest, west, and northwest. So if the agent moves west to (34,13), they would be next to the boulder. Then they can push west or south.

But the latest map shows that at position (35,12), there's a '@' symbol (agent). After moving south to (35,13), the map shows a different layout. The key is to find a path to the boulder and push it towards a fountain.

Looking at the fountains, the nearest one is adjacent north at (35,12) (but the agent was there before). The other fountains are east, eastsoutheast, and southsoutheast. So pushing the boulder east or southeast would be ideal.

Given the agent's position at (35,13), maybe moving east to (36,13) and then pushing the boulder east into the fountain. But earlier attempts to move east were blocked by bars. The latest language observation says ""bars very near southeast, southsouthwest, and northnorthwest."" So moving east might not be possible. Alternatively, the agent can move west to (34,13), get next to the boulder, and push it west or south.

But the boulder is adjacent southwest, so perhaps it's at (34,12). The agent is at (35,13). Moving west to (34,13) would put them adjacent to the boulder (which is at (34,12)). Then they can push the boulder west to (33,12), but need to check if there's a fountain there. If not, maybe push it south towards the fountain at (35,14) or southeast.

Alternatively, push the boulder south into the fountain. Let me check the fountain positions. The fountains are very near east, eastsoutheast, and southsoutheast. So if the boulder can be pushed southeast to (36,14) or similar, that would work.

Given the agent's current position and the boulder's location, the best action might be to move west to get next to the boulder and then push it south or southeast towards a fountain. So the chosen action would be ""push west"" or ""push south"".

Let's try to figure out what to do next. So far, I've been moving around, trying to push the boulder towards the fountains. The agent is currently at position (35, 12), and there's a boulder adjacent to the northeast. The goal is to push it onto a fountain.

Looking at the map, the boulder is near the northeast, and there's a fountain south of the agent. The challenge is navigating through the bars and dark areas. The agent tried pushing east and west before, but there were bars blocking the way. 

In the latest observation, moving west from (35,12) would take the agent to (34,12). But there's a boulder adjacent to the northeast, which might be blocking the path. The agent needs to position themselves to push the boulder south towards the fountain. 

The fountain is adjacent to the south, so pushing the boulder south would solve the problem. However, the agent has to get next to the boulder first. Since the boulder is to the northeast, the agent should move south or east to get in position. 

Wait, the agent is at (35,12). The boulder is adjacent northeast, which would be at (36,13) or (35,13). If the agent moves south to (35,13), they might be able to push the boulder east or south. But there's a fountain adjacent south, so pushing the boulder south into the fountain would be ideal. 

But the agent needs to check if there's space behind the boulder. The previous observations mention that the boulder can be pushed. The error messages when trying to push were likely due to not being adjacent. 

So, the next step is to move the agent closer to the boulder. Moving south to (35,13) would place the agent south of their current position, which might put them next to the boulder. Then, pushing south would move the boulder into the fountain. 

Alternatively, moving east to (36,12) and then pushing south could also work, but there are bars east of that position. 

Considering the map layout and the positions, moving south to (35,13) and then pushing south seems feasible. The agent needs to ensure they are adjacent to the boulder before attempting to push. 

So the plan is: move south to get next to the boulder, then push south into the fountain. Let's execute that.

Let's try to figure out what the best move here is. The agent is in a Boxoban-like game, trying to push boulders onto fountains. Let's look at the current observation.

The character is at position (35,13). The map shows some bars and dark areas around. There's a boulder very near northnortheast, and another boulder adjacent to the south. The fountains are near east, eastsoutheast, and southsoutheast. The stairs up are far to the east, so maybe that's a goal to get back up, but right now the priority is pushing the boulders onto fountains.

Looking at the cursor's position, the agent is facing east or west? The map's symbolism might be tricky, but in MiniHack, the '<' usually represents the agent facing left (west). So the agent is facing west. To push a boulder, the agent needs to move into it from behind. 

The boulder adjacent to the south is at (35,14), I think. If the agent moves south, they might be able to push the boulder further south if there's space. The fountain is at southsoutheast, so maybe pushing the boulder towards there. Alternatively, the boulder near northnortheast (maybe at (34,12)) could be pushed towards a fountain. 

But the agent is currently at (35,13). If they move west to (34,13), they might be able to push the boulder at (34,12) north or east. Wait, the boulder very near northnortheast—maybe that's at (34,12). If the agent goes west and then north, they can push that boulder into a fountain. 

Alternatively, the boulder adjacent south at (35,14) can be pushed south into the fountain at southsoutheast. To do that, the agent needs to move south to (35,14) and then push further south. But the current position is (35,13), so moving south once gets to (35,14), which is where the boulder is. Then pushing south from there would move the boulder to (35,15), which is towards the fountain. 

Let me check the fountain positions. The language observation says fountain very near east, eastsoutheast, and southsoutheast. So the southsoutheast fountain is probably at a location like (35,15) or similar. If the agent can push the southern boulder down to there, that would solve the puzzle. 

So the steps would be: move south to (35,14), then push south to move the boulder to (35,15), placing it on the fountain. That seems possible. Let's confirm the map. The map shows at position (35,14) there's a boulder adjacent south. So moving south into that boulder and then pushing south again should work. 

Alternatively, the other boulder at northnortheast might be closer to a fountain if pushed east. But the agent is facing west, so maybe it's easier to handle the southern boulder first. 

Therefore, the best action is to move south to get next to the boulder and then push it south onto the fountain.

Let's see where I am in this Boxoban game. The goal is to push the boulders onto the fountains. I'll look at the current observation.

The player is at position (35, 12). The map shows a lot of bars, dark areas, and some fountains. There's a boulder very near east, southeast, and southsouthwest. The nearest fountain is to the eastsoutheast and southeast. So maybe I need to push a boulder towards one of those fountains.

Looking at the language observation, the boulder is adjacent to southeast and west. Wait, the cursor is at (35,12), so the boulder nearby might be to the east or south. The message says ""boulder adjacent southeast and west."" So the boulder is south or southeast of the player?

If I'm at (35,12), moving south would take me to (35,13). The boulder is adjacent southeast and west. So if I move south, maybe the boulder is to the south-southeast. But how do I push it? The player needs to move into the boulder from behind. Wait, the boulder adjacent southeast and west — perhaps the boulder is at (36,13), and the player is at (35,12). Then moving east to (36,12) might allow pushing the boulder south to (36,13), but that's where the fountain is? Wait, the fountain is very near eastsoutheast and southeast. Maybe pushing the boulder to the southeast fountain.

Alternatively, check the map again. The map shows some `#` and `<` symbols. The `<` is probably the exit or stairs, but not sure. The fountains are marked with `.` maybe? Or perhaps `fountain` in the description refers to `.` on the map. But in the current map output, I don't see any `.` except for the `#` walls. Maybe the fountains are represented differently, like `f`?

Wait, the initial problem description says it's Boxoban, which usually has boxes on targets. The observations mention fountains, so maybe `f` on the map. But looking at the map provided in the observations, there are no `f` characters. The map shows a lot of `#` for walls, `.` maybe for floors, but the user's position is marked with `@` or `{` or something else. Let me check the cursor's position and the map.

In the last map shown, the player's position is at (35,12), which in the map is represented by `@` in line 5, position 4 (if counting from the left, each line is a row). Wait, the map lines are a bit hard to parse because they're all jumbled with `#` and other symbols. But the key is the fountains are near south and westsouthwest. So perhaps the target is to the southwest.

Alternatively, the boulder is at (36,12) and needs to be pushed to the fountain at (36,13) or somewhere else. But the player is at (35,12). To push the boulder east, the player needs to move east into the boulder's current position. So if the boulder is at (36,12), moving east to (36,12) and then pushing south would move it to (36,13), which is a fountain.

But how to confirm? The language observation says the boulder is very near east, southeast, and southsouthwest. The player is at (35,12). If the boulder is east, that's (36,12). So moving east to (36,12) and then pushing south would place it on the fountain at (36,13). That seems like a valid move.

So the plan is: move east to the boulder, then push it south towards the fountain. But the previous attempts to push didn't work because maybe the direction was wrong or the boulder wasn't in the right position. Let me check the last message. The last message was ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" Which means the previous push action was invalid, perhaps because the player wasn't behind the boulder or there was an obstacle.

Looking back at the history: the agent tried moving east, then pushed east, then south, west, etc. But the boulder might not be in the direction they tried to push. For example, pushing west when the boulder is to the east wouldn't work.

So current position (35,12). The boulder is very near east (36,12), southeast (36,13), and southsouthwest (34,14?). Need to move east to (36,12) and then push it south to (36,13), which is a fountain. That should solve the puzzle.

So the next action should be east to get next to the boulder, then push south.

Let's see where I am. I'm a samurai at position (36, 12). The map has a bunch of bars and dark areas around. There's a staircase up near eastsoutheast, but I'm not sure if that's useful yet. The main goal is to push boulders onto fountains.

Looking at the observations, there's a boulder very near east, southeast, and southsouthwest. The fountains are near south and southeast. So, I need to get one of those boulders towards a fountain. 

Right now, I'm at (36,12). Let me check the adjacent areas. To the east (36,12) is a boulder adjacent to the west. So if I move east, maybe I can push the boulder west? But I need to check if there's space behind it. The message said I can't push boulders if there's an obstacle behind. 

Wait, in the last observation, when I tried pushing west before, it said ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" That might mean there's something blocking the boulder's path. Let me look at the map again. The cursor is at (37,12) previously, but now I'm back at (36,12). 

The map shows some structures with `#` and `.` which might be walls or other obstacles. The boulder is adjacent to east (which would be my current position's east, so maybe at (37,12)). If I push west, the boulder would go to (36,12), but I'm already here. So maybe the boulder is at (37,12) west of me. 

If I move east to (37,12), I can then push west to move the boulder to (36,12), which is where I am now. But since there are bars very near north, northeast, etc., maybe there's a wall blocking the path. The language observation mentions bars very near north, northeast, etc., which could be walls that prevent movement. 

Alternatively, maybe the boulder is stuck between trees or walls. Let me check the latest observations. The boulder adjacent east and northwest. So the boulder at (37,12) is adjacent to east (my current position) and northwest. If I try to push it west, it would move to (36,12), which is my current position. But if there's a wall or another obstacle there, I can't push it. 

The message when pushing west before said it didn't work, so maybe the path is blocked. Perhaps I need to move around to a different position to push the boulder. Let's see, moving south to (36,13) might give me a different angle. Then I could try pushing west there. 

Alternatively, check if there's another boulder. The language observation mentions a boulder very near southsoutheast and southwest. Maybe that's another one further south. If I can get to that one, perhaps I can push it towards the fountain near southsouthwest. 

But right now, the immediate boulder is east of me. Let's think step by step. 

1. Move east to (37,12) to be next to the boulder.
2. Push west to (36,12), but if that's blocked, try another direction.
3. If that's not possible, move south to (36,13) and see if I can push the boulder from there.

Alternatively, check the map for fountains. The fountain is very near south and west. So maybe the boulder needs to be pushed south towards the fountain. 

If the boulder is at (37,12), pushing it south to (37,13) could get it closer to the fountain at south. Let's see if that's possible. 

But to push south, I need to be adjacent to the boulder. If I move east first to (37,12), then push south to (37,13). If there's no obstacle there, that might work. 

The map shows some `#` which are probably walls. Let me check the map layout. The cursor is at (37,12) previously, and the map has a lot of `#` in the fourth line: `#.`.@######` which might be a wall blocking movement east beyond that point. So pushing the boulder east might be impossible due to the wall. 

Therefore, the best option is to push the boulder south. Move east to (37,12), then push south to (37,13). If that's clear, then the boulder moves there, getting closer to the fountain at southsouthwest. 

Alternatively, check if moving south first allows a better push direction. If I go south to (36,13), then maybe push west or east. 

But considering the latest observation, after moving south to (35,13), the boulder is adjacent south. So maybe pushing the boulder south from there. 

Wait, the boulder is very near southsoutheast and southwest. If I can get it to the fountain near southsouthwest, that would solve the problem. 

Alternatively, maybe the fountain is at (southsouthwest), and the boulder is at (southsoutheast). So pushing the boulder southwest towards the fountain. 

But to do that, I need to position myself correctly. Let's try to map out the coordinates. 

The agent is at (35,12) after some moves. The boulder is near eastsoutheast and southsoutheast. Suppose the boulder is at (37,13). Then pushing it southwest to (36,12), which is the agent's current position. But that might not reach the fountain. 

Alternatively, the fountain is at (southsouthwest), which could be (34,14) or similar. The agent needs to move the boulder towards there. 

This is getting a bit confusing. Let me focus on the immediate surrounding. The agent is at (36,12). There's a boulder adjacent east (37,12). To push it west, need to be next to it and have a clear path. But the message said pushing west didn't work before. Maybe there's a wall at (36,12) west, which is where the agent is, so pushing the boulder into a wall. 

Alternatively, the boulder is at (37,12) and pushing it south to (37,13). If that's possible, then the boulder moves south, possibly towards the fountain. 

Looking at the map, the line at y=13 has `#`s, so maybe moving south from (37,12) to (37,13) is blocked by a wall. 

In that case, perhaps the best move is to move south to (36,13) and then try pushing the boulder west from there. 

So the sequence would be: west to (35,12), then south to (35,13), then east to (36,13), then push west to (35,13). But I need to check if that's possible. 

Alternatively, since the agent is at (36,12), moving south to (36,13) and then trying to push the boulder west. 

But I need to ensure there's no obstacle behind the boulder when pushing. If the boulder is at (37,12), pushing west to (36,12) would require that (35,12) is clear. But according to the map, there are `#`s in the fourth line, which might be blocking movement west from (35,12). 

This is getting complicated. Maybe the best approach is to move around to a different position to access the boulder without being blocked. 

Alternatively, since the agent has a bow (yumi), maybe using a ranged attack to break obstacles, but the problem is pushing boulders, not fighting monsters. 

Wait, the available actions are movement and push. So the focus is on movement and pushing. 

Given the latest cursor position is (36,12), and the boulder is adjacent east, perhaps moving east to (37,12) and then trying to push south or west. 

If I move east to (37,12), then try pushing south to (37,13). If that's possible, the boulder would move there. Then, maybe from there, push it further south towards the fountain. 

Alternatively, check if the path south from (37,12) is blocked. The map's y=13 line has `#`s, so moving south might be blocked. 

In that case, pushing the boulder west to (36,12) but that's where the agent is. Unless there's a clear path west from (36,12), which there might not be due to the `#`s. 

Hmm. This is tricky. Maybe the best action is to move east to (37,12) and attempt to push west, even if it seems blocked, to see if the environment allows it. 

Alternatively, move south to (36,13) and then try pushing the boulder west from there. 

Given the previous attempts to push west didn't work, maybe the boulder is blocked by a wall or another obstacle. 

Another angle: the fountain is near south, so pushing the boulder south might be better. If the boulder is at (37,12), pushing it south to (37,13) could get it closer to the fountain. 

Assuming there's no wall at (37,13), that could work. 

So the plan is: move east to (37,12), then push south to (37,13). 

Therefore, the next action should be east to get next to the boulder, then push south. 

But since the agent is already at (36,12), moving east once would get to (37,12). 

So first action: east. Then, push south. 

But in the current observation, after moving west back to (36,12), the boulder is adjacent east. So the correct sequence is east to (37,12), then push south. 

Therefore, the chosen action is east to position next to the boulder, then push south. 

But since the agent needs to output a single action, the first step is to move east to get into position. 

So the next action should be east.

",-0.001,False
75,push south,"<reasoning>
Let's see. I need to push a boulder onto a fountain in this Boxoban-like game. The agent is the samurai at (37, 12). The map has a bunch of bars and dark areas, and there's a boulder near southsoutheast and southsouthwest. The fountain is also near those areas.

Looking at the cursor position and the map, the agent is facing east. The last action was 'east' which moved them to (37, 12). Now, the boulder is adjacent to the southeast and west. The message said ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain"" when they tried pushing west before. So maybe the boulder is stuck because there's something behind it.

Wait, the language observation mentions a boulder adjacent southeast and west. So the boulder is to the southeast and west of the agent's current position. The agent is at (37,12). If the boulder is to the west, that would be (36,12). But the agent just moved east to (37,12). The previous attempt to push west failed because the boulder couldn't move. Maybe there's an obstacle behind the boulder, like a bar or another boulder.

The goal is to push the boulder onto the fountain. The fountain is near south and southsouthwest. So the boulder needs to be moved southward towards those coordinates. Let me check the map again. The agent's current position is (37,12). The boulder is near southsoutheast and southsouthwest. Maybe moving the boulder south would line it up with the fountain.

But the agent is currently at (37,12). To push the boulder south, the agent needs to move into the boulder's direction. If the boulder is to the southeast, then moving south from the agent's position would approach the boulder. Wait, the boulder is adjacent southeast and west. So the boulder is at (37,13) southeast and (36,12) west. The agent is at (37,12), so the west direction is (36,12) where there's a boulder. But when the agent tried pushing west before, it didn't work because the boulder couldn't move. That suggests there's an obstacle behind the boulder to the west, like a bar or a wall.

So perhaps the boulder is blocked to the west, but maybe to the southeast, there's a path. If the agent moves south to (37,13), they can then try pushing the boulder southeast. Let me check the map. The agent's current map shows a lot of ########## which are probably walls or bars. The cursor is at (37,12), and moving south to (37,13) might be possible if there's no obstacle. The language observation mentions dark areas in the south, but not specifically blocking movement.

Alternatively, maybe the boulder is at (37,13) southeast of the agent. If the agent moves south and then pushes the boulder east or south, that could position it towards the fountain. The fountain is near southsouthwest, so moving the boulder southwest might be better. But the agent's current position is east of the boulder's west side. Hmm.

Wait, the boulder is adjacent west and southeast. So the boulder is to the left (west) and to the lower-right (southeast) of the agent. The agent is at (37,12). The boulder west is at (36,12), and the boulder southeast is at (37,13). The fountain is near south, so maybe the southeast boulder is the one to move. If the agent moves south to (37,13), then they can push the boulder east or south. But pushing east would take it towards the bars, which might not be helpful. Pushing south might move it towards the fountain.

Let me check the language observation again. The fountain is very near south and westsouthwest. So maybe the agent needs to get the boulder to the southwest area. If the boulder is at (37,13) southeast of the agent, pushing it south to (37,14) could position it closer to the fountain. However, the map shows ########## which might be solid walls, so moving south might not be possible unless there's a path.

Alternatively, the agent could move west to (36,12) where there's a boulder, but pushing it west is blocked. So perhaps the best approach is to move south to (37,13) and then push the boulder east or south. But east would be towards the bars, which are probably obstacles. South might lead towards the fountain.

Alternatively, maybe the agent should move east again to (38,12) and then try pushing the boulder south or southeast. But looking at the map, the east side has ##########, which might be walls. So moving east might not be possible.

Another idea: the stairs up are near eastsoutheast. Maybe the goal is to get the boulder to the fountain at southsouthwest. So the agent needs to move the boulder southwest. If the boulder is at (37,13) southeast of the agent, pushing it southwest would take it to (36,12), but that's where another boulder is adjacent. So that's not possible. Maybe pushing the boulder south to (37,14) and then west?

Wait, perhaps the agent should first move south to (37,13), then push the boulder east or south. Since pushing east is blocked by bars, pushing south might be better. Let's try that. So the action would be ""push south"". But the agent needs to be adjacent to the boulder to push it. If the agent is at (37,12) and the boulder is at (37,13) southeast, then moving south to (37,13) makes the agent adjacent to the boulder. Then pushing south would move the boulder to (37,14). If that's possible, then the boulder would be closer to the fountain at southsouthwest.

Alternatively, if the agent is already adjacent to the boulder, maybe they can push it directly. Wait, in the last observation, the agent was at (35, y=12) and moved west to (35,12), then tried pushing west which failed. Now they're back at (36,12) or (37,12)? Let me check the history.

Looking back, the agent's position changes:

1. Started at (37,11)
2. moved north (default after invalid)
3. moved east to (37,11) again? Wait, no. The initial actions were push south (invalid), then defaulted to north. Then east to (37,11), then push west (invalid), defaulted to north. Then west to (36,11), then push south (invalid), defaulted to north. Then south to (36,12), west to (35,12), push west (invalid), defaulted to north, back to (35,12). Then south to (35,13), push west (invalid), defaulted to north, back to (35,12). Then west to (34,12)? Wait, the history is a bit confusing. Let me retrace:

- Initial position (37,11)
- Action: push south (invalid) → defaulted to north, position remains (37,11)
- Observation message: ""You cannot pass through the bars.""
- Then action: east → position (38,11)
- Then action: push west (invalid) → defaulted to north, position (38,11)
- Observation message: ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain.""
- Then action: west → position (37,11)
- Then action: push south (invalid) → defaulted to north, position (37,11)
- Observation message: ""You cannot pass through the bars.""
- Then action: south → position (37,12)
- Then action: west → position (36,12)
- Then action: push west (invalid) → defaulted to north, position (36,12)
- Observation message: ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain.""
- Then action: west → position (35,12)
- Then action: south → position (35,13)
- Then action: push west (invalid) → defaulted to north, position (35,13)
- Observation message: message unclear
- Then action: west → position (34,13)
- Then action: push south (invalid) → defaulted to north, position (34,13)
- Observation message: ...
- Then action: east → position (35,13)
- Now current position is (37,12) as per the latest observation.

Wait, the latest observation before this one shows the agent at (37,12). The map shows that the agent is in a corridor with bars around. The boulder is near southsoutheast and southsouthwest. The fountain is near south and southwest.

Given the current position (37,12), the agent should try to move towards the boulder. The boulder is adjacent west and southeast. So to the west is (36,12), where there's a boulder, and to the southeast is (37,13), another boulder. The agent needs to push one of these boulders onto the fountain.

The fountain is near southsouthwest, which is to the southwest of the agent's current position. So perhaps pushing the boulder at (37,13) southeast towards the southwest direction.

To do that, the agent needs to move south to (37,13), then push the boulder south or southwest. However, pushing southwest from (37,13) would take it to (36,12), which is where another boulder is adjacent. So that's not possible. Therefore, pushing the boulder at (37,13) south to (37,14) might be an option, but then how does that help reach the fountain at southsouthwest?

Alternatively, maybe the other boulder at (36,12) west of the agent can be pushed. But pushing it west is blocked by barriers. The agent tried that before and it failed.

Another approach: The agent should look for a path to the fountain. The fountain is at southsouthwest, so maybe moving the boulder there. If the agent can push the boulder at (37,13) south to (37,14), then west to (36,14), then south again, but the map's layout is unclear with all those ##########.

Alternatively, maybe the agent should move east to (38,12) and then try pushing a boulder. But the east side has bars, so that's probably blocked.

Wait, the latest language observation says: ""boulder very near southsoutheast and southwest"". So the boulder is near those areas. The agent is at (37,12). To reach the southwest fountain, perhaps the agent needs to move the boulder southwest. But how?

If the boulder is at (37,13) southeast of the agent, pushing it southwest would require the agent to be positioned to the northeast of the boulder. But the agent is currently south of the boulder. So maybe the agent should move north to (37,11), then west to (36,11), then south to (36,12) where there's a boulder, but pushing west is blocked.

This is getting complicated. Let's recap:

- Agent is at (37,12)
- Boulder adjacent west (36,12) and southeast (37,13)
- Fountain at southsouthwest
- Need to push a boulder onto the fountain

Possible steps:

1. Move south to (37,13) to be adjacent to the southeast boulder.
2. Push the boulder south to (37,14)
3. From there, push it west to (36,14), but need to check if that's possible
4. Continue moving the boulder southwest towards the fountain

Alternatively, after moving south to (37,13), push the boulder southwest to (36,12), but there's already a boulder there, so that's impossible.

Another idea: The agent could move west to (36,12) where the boulder is, but pushing it west is blocked. So maybe focus on the other boulder at (37,13).

If the agent moves south to (37,13) and then pushes the boulder east, but east is blocked by bars. So pushing south to (37,14) is the only option. Then from (37,14), maybe push west or south again.

But without knowing the map's layout beyond the bars, it's hard to say. Alternatively, the agent should try to move towards the fountain's location. The fountain is near southsouthwest, which is southwest of the agent's current position. So moving the boulder in the southwest direction.

Perhaps the best action now is to move south to (37,13) and then push the boulder south. So the chosen action would be ""push south"".

",-0.001,False
76,push south,"<reasoning>
The agent is trying to push a boulder onto a fountain in Boxoban. Let's look at the current situation based on the observations.

The cursor is at (37, 11). The north direction was previously tried but there were bars blocking the path. The boulder is adjacent to the southeast and west. The fountain is very near the south and westsouthwest. So, the boulder needs to be moved south towards the fountain.

But the agent tried pushing west and south before, but maybe the boulder isn't in the right position. Let me check the map. The boulder is adjacent southeast and west, so maybe it's west of the agent. If the agent moves west, they might be able to push the boulder south by walking into it from the west. 

Wait, the previous attempts to push west or south resulted in messages saying the boulder couldn't be moved. That might be because the path behind the boulder is blocked by bars or other obstacles. The agent needs to ensure there's a clear space south of the boulder to push it. 

Looking at the language observation, there are bars very near north, northeast, etc., which might be blocking the path. The agent should try to move around the boulder to a position where they can push it south. Since the boulder is adjacent west, moving west to be next to it and then pushing south might work if there's space behind. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to move the boulder east first to clear the path. But east has bars as well. The best bet is to try pushing the boulder south again, but perhaps from a different angle. The agent is at (37,11). If they move west to (36,11) and then try pushing south, that might work if there's no obstacle behind the boulder. 

Wait, the latest observation shows the boulder adjacent southeast and west. So the boulder is south of west. If the agent is at (37,11), moving west to (36,11) would place them north of the boulder. Then pushing the boulder south from there might be possible if there's no barrier. 

But the previous attempts to push south resulted in failure. Maybe the agent needs to reposition. Alternatively, check if the boulder is on a fountain already. The fountain is near south and southsouthwest. If the boulder is already there, the goal is achieved. But the observation says the boulder is near southsoutheast and southsouthwest, which are near the fountain. Maybe the boulder is just one step away. 

The agent should try to push the boulder south again. Even if it failed before, perhaps there was a temporary obstacle. The latest cursor position is (37,11), and the boulder is adjacent southeast and west. So the boulder is at (37,12) or (38,11). If the agent is at (37,11) and pushes south, they would move into (37,12), which is where the boulder might be. Wait, no. To push the boulder south, the agent needs to be north of it. So if the boulder is at (37,12), the agent at (37,11) can push it south to (37,13). But the fountain is at south and southsouthwest, which might be (37,13) or nearby. 

Assuming the path from (37,12) to (37,13) is clear, pushing the boulder south would place it on the fountain. The previous failure might have been due to an obstacle in that path. Checking the language observation, bars are very near north, northeast, etc., but not specifically mentioned at (37,13). So maybe it's possible. 

The agent should attempt to push the boulder south again from its current position. The action would be ""push south"".

Let's try to figure out what to do here. The agent is in a Boxoban-like environment, which is a Sokoban variant where the goal is to push boulders onto fountains. The previous attempts involved moving around but not successfully pushing any boulders. The last few actions tried pushing south, but that didn't work because the agent hit bars.

Looking at the current observation, the agent's position is (37, 11). The boulder is adjacent to the southeast and west. The fountains are near the south and southwest. The bars are adjacent to north, northeast, east, and northwest. So, the agent is surrounded by bars on three sides except to the south and southwest. 

The agent needs to push a boulder onto a fountain. The closest boulder is to the southeast. To push it into the fountain, the agent must move towards it. However, the agent is at (37,11), and the boulder is adjacent southeast. So, the boulder is likely at (38,12). To push it south into the fountain, the agent needs to move south into the boulder, which would push it further south. But the problem is that the bars are blocking the way. The bars are adjacent to the north, northeast, east, and northwest. That means the agent is next to bars on those sides. 

Wait, the bars adjacent to the agent are north, northeast, east, and northwest. So the agent can't move north, northeast, east, or northwest without hitting bars. The only directions open might be south and southwest. 

Looking at the map, the agent is at x=37, y=11. If they go south to y=12, but the boulder is at southeast (x=38, y=12). The agent needs to position themselves to push the boulder. Maybe the agent should first move east to get next to the boulder. But east is blocked by bars. Alternatively, maybe move west? But the agent is already at x=37. 

Wait, the boulder is adjacent southeast, so it's one square east and one square south from the agent. To push the boulder south, the agent needs to move into the boulder's current position (southwest of the boulder) and push it. But the agent is at (37,11). The boulder would be at (38,12). To push it south to (38,13), the agent needs to move east (to 38,11) and then push south. But moving east is blocked by bars. 

Hmm, maybe the agent needs to move west first. Wait, the agent's current x is 37. Moving west to x=36 would put them at (36,11). Then, from there, moving east into the boulder's current position (37,11) which is blocked by a bar. No, the bars are adjacent to the agent's current position. So moving west is allowed? Let me check the language observation. The bars adjacent to the agent are north, northeast, east, and northwest. So west is not adjacent, so maybe moving west is possible. 

If the agent moves west to (36,11), then they can try to move east into the boulder's position. But wait, the boulder is at (38,12). Maybe the agent needs to move around to the correct position. Alternatively, perhaps the agent needs to find a way to get next to the boulder without being blocked by bars. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent should look for another boulder. The observation mentions a boulder near southsoutheast and southsouthwest. So maybe there's another boulder further south. But pushing that might not be the priority. 

The key is to push the boulder onto the fountain. The fountain is near the south and southwest. The boulder adjacent southeast is at (38,12), and the fountain is at south (maybe (38,13) or similar). The agent is at (37,11). To push the boulder south, the agent needs to move into (38,12) and push it to (38,13). But the agent can't move east from (37,11) because that's blocked by a bar. So perhaps the agent needs to go around to the west or north, but those are also blocked. 

Wait, the agent's current position is (37,11). The bars are adjacent to the north, northeast, east, and northwest. So the agent can move south, west, or maybe down some other direction. But the available actions are only north, east, south, west. So possible moves are south or west. 

Moving west to (36,11) is possible. From there, maybe move south to (36,12). Then try to move east towards the boulder. But the boulder is at (38,12). So from (36,12), moving east twice would reach (38,12). But the bars might be in the way. The language observation says bars very near north, northeast, northeast, etc. Maybe there's a path. 

Alternatively, the agent could move south to (37,12), then east to (38,12) and push south. But east from (37,12) is blocked by a bar. 

This is getting complicated. Maybe the best approach is to try to move south to get next to the boulder. The agent is at (37,11). Moving south to (37,12). From there, the boulder is at (38,12). To push it, the agent needs to move east into (38,12) and then push south. But moving east from (37,12) is blocked by a bar. So that's not possible. 

Wait, the bars adjacent to (37,12) might be different. Let me check the language observation again. The bars adjacent to the current position (37,11) are north, northeast, east, and northwest. When moving south to (37,12), the adjacent bars might be different. The observation says bars very near north, northeast, northeast, etc. Maybe moving south is allowed. 

At (37,12), the agent can check if there's a bar blocking east. If not, then the agent can move east to (38,12) and push the boulder. But according to the language observation, bars are very near north, northeast, eastnortheast, etc. So maybe moving east from (37,12) is possible. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent should try to move west and then find another path. 

Given the constraints, the most feasible action might be to move south to (37,12), then east to (38,12) and push south. Even if there's a bar, but maybe not. 

Alternatively, the agent could try to move west to (36,11), then south to (36,12), then east twice. But I'm not sure if that's possible. 

Another possibility is that the agent needs to interact with the boulder adjacent to the west. The language observation says boulder adjacent west. So the boulder is at (36,11). But the agent is at (37,11). To push that boulder east, the agent needs to move west into (36,11) and push east. But that boulder is at (36,11), and the fountain is near southwest, which might be (35,11) or similar. So pushing it east into (37,11) where the agent is might not help. 

This is tricky. Maybe the best action is to attempt to push the boulder to the southeast. Since the agent is at (37,11), the boulder is at (38,12). To push it south, the agent needs to move into (38,12) and push. But how to get there? The agent can move south to (37,12), then east to (38,12). If that's possible. 

Given that the previous attempts to push didn't work because of bars, maybe the agent needs to position themselves correctly. 

So the plan is: move south to (37,12), then east to (38,12), then push south. But first check if moving east from (37,12) is possible. 

The language observation says bars very near north, northeast, eastnortheast, etc. So moving east from (37,12) might be blocked. If that's the case, then the agent can't proceed that way. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent should move west to (36,11), then south to (36,12), then east to (37,12), then south to (37,13), and try to push the boulder from there. But this is speculative. 

Given the limited information, the best guess is to try pushing the boulder in the direction of the fountain. The agent should move towards the boulder and push it south. So the action would be ""push south"". But since that previously resulted in a failure due to bars, maybe the agent needs to adjust their position first. 

Wait, the latest observation after the previous ""push south"" action had the agent at (37,11) with the message ""You cannot pass through the bars."" So pushing south wasn't possible because there's a bar in the way. 

Therefore, the agent needs to find a way to get next to the boulder without hitting bars. The only open direction seems to be south. But moving south from (37,11) to (37,12) might be possible. From there, maybe east is possible. 

So the sequence would be: move south to (37,12), then east to (38,12), then push south. 

But first, check if moving south is allowed. The bars adjacent at (37,11) are north, northeast, east, northwest. So moving south should be possible. 

After moving south to (37,12), the adjacent bars would be different. The language observation for (37,12) might have bars to the northeast or east. If moving east is blocked, then the agent can't proceed. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent should move west to (36,11), then south to (36,12), then east to (37,12), then south to (37,13), and push the boulder from there. 

This is getting complicated. Given the time constraints, perhaps the best action is to try ""push south"" again, but the agent needs to be in the correct position. Alternatively, move south and then try to push again. 

Considering all this, the chosen action is to move south to get closer to the boulder, then attempt to push it south once positioned correctly.

I need to figure out the next move in this Boxoban game. Let's look at the current situation.

The agent is at position (37, 12). The map shows that there are boulders nearby—in particular, a boulder is adjacent to the east and northwest. The goal is to push the boulders onto the fountains. Looking at the observations, there's a fountain adjacent to the south. So, the nearby boulder to the east might be the one to push towards that fountain.

The last actions were trying to push west or south, but it didn't work because of bars or obstacles. Now, the cursor is back at (37, 12). The boulder to the east is at (38,12) probably. To push it south, the agent needs to move into the boulder while ensuring there's space behind it. Checking the map, south of (38,12) there's a fountain. So pushing the east boulder south would get it onto the fountain, which is the objective.

The previous attempts to push resulted in errors, maybe because the path wasn't clear. Let me confirm the direction. The boulder is east, so pushing it south would require the agent to move east into the boulder, then the boulder moves south. Since the fountain is south of there, this should work. Need to make sure there's no obstacle behind the boulder. The observation mentions bars near north, east, etc., but not specifically blocking behind the boulder. So the action should be push east south? Wait, the actions are push direction, like push south, push north, etc. But the direction is relative to the agent's position. So to push the boulder east, the agent needs to be west of it and push east. Wait, the boulder is adjacent to the east (the agent is at 37,12, so east is 38,12). To push the boulder east, the agent would have to move into it from the west and push east. But the agent is already west of the boulder. So the correct action is push east. Wait, no—pushing a boulder means the agent walks into it in the direction they want to push. So if the agent is at (37,12) and wants to push the boulder at (38,12) to the south, the agent needs to move east into the boulder, then the boulder moves south. So the action should be push east, which would push the boulder to the south. That way, the boulder ends up on the fountain south of (38,12).

Yes, that makes sense. So the correct action is push east. Let me double-check the previous messages. When the user tried push west or push south before, it didn't work because maybe the direction was incorrect. Now, pushing east towards the boulder should work if there's space behind. The observation says the boulder is adjacent east and northwest, so pushing east would move it south towards the fountain. There's a fountain adjacent south, so that's the target. Therefore, the next action should be push east.

The agent needs to push a boulder onto a fountain in Boxoban. Let's look at the current observation.

The player is at (x=37, y=11) facing north. The map shows several boulders and fountains around. The immediate area has bars (obstacles) to the northeast, east, and northwest. There's a boulder adjacent to the southeast and west. The fountain is adjacent to the south.

The previous attempts to push a boulder resulted in failure, possibly because the agent was trying to push in the wrong direction or into an obstacle. The valid actions here are movement and pushing. The agent needs to find a boulder that can be pushed towards a fountain without being blocked.

Looking at the current position, moving south is possible since there's a fountain there. The boulder to the southeast might be pushable if there's space behind it. Alternatively, moving east might lead to another boulder. But the maps show that pushing south could get the boulder onto the fountain adjacent to the south.

So, the best action is to push south towards the fountain. The agent should try 'push south' again, making sure there's no obstacle behind the boulder. Since the last attempt was invalid due to incorrect syntax, now the correct format should work.

Let's try to figure out how to solve this Boxoban problem. The goal is to push all the boulders onto the fountains. From the observations, I can see that there are a few boulders and fountains on the map. The agent is currently at position (37, 11).

First, looking at the language observations, there's a boulder adjacent southeast and west. The cursor is at (37, 11), so the boulder to the southeast would be at (38, 12), and the one to the west at (36, 11). The fountains are adjacent south, so one is at (37, 12) and another at (37, 10). 

The message says ""You cannot pass through the bars,"" which probably means there's a barrier blocking the path. The agent tried pushing south before but failed because of the bars. So the immediate direction to push might not work. 

Looking at the map, there are a lot of ########## which are probably walls or immovable objects. The agent needs to navigate around these to position itself correctly to push the boulders towards the fountains. 

The previous actions were a series of moves and pushes, but they kept getting defaulted to north because the input was invalid. The user needs to ensure the actions are valid. 

The current position is (37, 11). The boulder to the southeast is at (38, 12). To push it south towards the fountain at (38, 13), the agent needs to be adjacent to the boulder. However, the agent is at (37, 11), so moving east to (38, 11) would position them north of the boulder. Then, pushing east would move the boulder to (39, 12), but that's not towards the fountain. Alternatively, moving south to (37, 12) puts them next to the boulder at (38, 12), then pushing south would move it to (38, 13), which is adjacent to the fountain at (38, 12). Wait, the fountain is at (37, 12), so maybe the boulder needs to be pushed to (38, 12) to be on the fountain. 

Wait, the fountains are adjacent southeast and west. So perhaps the agent needs to get the boulder to (38, 12), which is on the fountain. To do that, the agent needs to move east to (38, 11), then push east to move the boulder to (39, 12). Then move south to (39, 13) and push south again to get it to (39, 14), but that might not reach the fountain. Hmm, maybe there's a better path. 

Alternatively, the agent could move south to (37, 12), which is next to the boulder at (38, 12). Then push south to move the boulder to (38, 13), which is adjacent to the fountain at (37, 12). But that's not directly on the fountain. The fountain is at (37, 12), so the boulder needs to be placed there. 

Wait, maybe the boulder at (38, 12) needs to be moved west to (37, 12) to be on the fountain. To do that, the agent has to be at (38, 11) and push west. But the agent is currently at (37, 11). So the steps would be: move east to (38, 11), then push west to move the boulder from (38, 12) to (37, 12), which is the fountain. That makes sense. 

So the correct sequence would be: east to (38, 11), then push west. Let's check if that's possible. The observation says there's a boulder adjacent southeast and west. The agent is at (37, 11), moving east to (38, 11) would place them north of the boulder at (38, 12). Then pushing west would move the boulder from (38, 12) to (37, 12), which is the fountain. 

Yes, that should work. So the actions needed are first move east, then push west. The previous attempts were pushing in the wrong direction or didn't position the agent correctly. The agent needs to validly input 'east' followed by 'push west' to solve this. 

But the user needs to ensure that the actions are valid. The previous attempts had invalid actions like 'push south' when not adjacent, leading to defaults. So the correct actions now are to move east to get next to the boulder and then push west towards the fountain.

Let's see where I am. I'm in Boxoban, trying to push boulders onto fountains. The map has a lot of bars blocking paths, so I need to find a way around them. From the previous actions and observations, I've been moving around trying to get to a boulder.

Looking at the current position (x=37, y=11), the cursor shows I'm a samurai. The message says I can't pass through bars, which means there's a bar blocking my way. The language observation mentions bars very near north, northeast, east, southeast, etc., but specifically, bars adjacent to the northeast, east, and northwest. 

The boulders are near eastsoutheast and southsoutheast, and there's a fountain very near south and westsouthwest. So maybe the goal is to push a boulder towards the fountain at westsouthwest.

But my last attempt to push south failed because of bars. Now I'm back at (37,11). The adjacent boulder is southeast and west. Wait, the boulder adjacent east and northwest? Or was that in a previous step? Let me check.

In the latest observation, the boulder is adjacent southeast and west. So there's a boulder to the southeast and west of my current position. Since I'm at (37,11), southeast would be (38,12), and west would be (36,11). But I tried moving east before and got blocked by bars. Maybe I need to move west to reach the boulder west of here.

Alternatively, maybe there's a boulder I can push east towards a fountain. The fountain is near westsouthwest, which would be to the southwest direction. But with bars blocking east, pushing a boulder east might not be possible. Let me think.

The stairs are up near eastsoutheast, but that's probably a distraction. The key is to get the boulder onto the fountain. The fountains are at southsoutheast and west. The boulder near southsoutheast might need to be moved further south. But I'm at (37,11), and the boulder is adjacent southeast (38,12). If I can push that boulder south, it might reach the fountain at southsoutheast.

But how to get to it? From (37,11), moving east would be towards the bars. Moving south to (37,12) might be possible if there's no barrier. Let me check the map. The map shows a certain layout with bars and dark areas. The cursor is at (37,11), and the map's fourth line has #.`@######, which might indicate my position near some structures.

Alternatively, perhaps moving west to (36,11) where there's a boulder adjacent. If I move west, then I can try to push the boulder west or north. But the fountain is at westsouthwest, so pushing the boulder southwest might be tricky due to bars.

Wait, the latest language observation says bars adjacent northeast, east, and northwest. So from (37,11), moving northeast would go into bars. Moving east is blocked by bars. Northwest is also blocked. So maybe I need to go south first to clear a path.

If I move south to (37,12), then check if there's a path. The map's fifth line is #{.@`#####, which might mean at (37,12), there's a @ symbol (me) or another feature. But since the cursor is at (37,11), moving south would take me to (37,12). Let me see if that's clear.

Alternatively, since pushing the boulder to the east is blocked by bars, maybe I need to find another boulder. The other boulder is near southsoutheast. If I can get to that one, perhaps push it towards the fountain at southsoutheast.

But how to reach it? From (37,11), moving east is blocked by bars. Maybe moving south and then east? Let me try to visualize the map.

The map has a lot of ########## lines, which are probably walls or bars. The cursor is near some structures. The key is to avoid bars and find a path to a boulder that can be pushed towards a fountain.

Given that the last attempt to push south resulted in a message about bars, maybe I need to move in a different direction. Let's try moving west to (36,11) where there's a boulder adjacent. If I move west, then I can attempt to push the boulder west or north.

But the fountain is at westsouthwest, which is southwest from here. Pushing the boulder southwest might require moving it through the southwest direction, but there might be bars in the way.

Alternatively, maybe pushing the boulder north towards the stairs up eastsoutheast, but that doesn't seem helpful. The goal is to get the boulder onto the fountain, so southerly direction might be better.

Wait, the fountain very near south and westsouthwest. So if I can get a boulder to the southwest, that would be good. From (37,11), moving southwest would be to (36,10), but I need to check if that's possible.

Alternatively, maybe the boulder at (38,12) (southeast of me) can be pushed south to (38,13), then towards the fountain at southsoutheast. But I need to approach that boulder first.

To get to the boulder at (38,12), I need to move east from (37,11) to (38,11), but that's blocked by bars. So that's not possible. Hence, perhaps I need to find another path.

Looking at the map again, the lines have #.`.###### etc., which might be indicating walls or barriers. The @ symbol is at (37,11), so maybe moving south to (37,12) is the way to go, as that line has #{.@`#####, which could mean there's a path there.

Once I'm at (37,12), maybe I can move east or west. If there's a clear path east, perhaps I can find a boulder there. But the bars are adjacent east, so moving east from (37,12) would still be blocked.

Alternatively, moving south again to (37,13), but I need to check the map. The map's sixth line is #..{...<##, which might indicate a path with some obstacles.

This is getting a bit confusing. Let me recap:

- Current position: (37,11)
- Adjacent boulders: southeast and west.
- Barriers: northeast, east, northwest.
- Goal: Push a boulder onto the fountain at southsoutheast or westsouthwest.

The boulder to the west is at (36,11). If I move west to (36,11), then I can try to push that boulder. Let's see:

Move west to (36,11). Then, check if there's a boulder there. The language observation says ""boulder adjacent southeast and west"", so at (37,11), the boulders are adjacent southeast (38,12) and west (36,11). So moving west to (36,11) would place me next to the boulder at (36,11). Then, I can try to push it west or north.

If I push west from (36,11), that would go to (35,11), but I need to check if there's a fountain there. The fountain is at westsouthwest, which is probably southwest from the starting point. Alternatively, pushing the boulder north to (36,10) might lead towards the fountain.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, pushing the boulder east from (36,11) back to (37,11), but that's where I am now, and there are bars to the east.

Hmm. Maybe pushing the boulder south from (36,11) to (36,12). If that's possible, then it could move towards the fountain.

Alternatively, since the fountain is at southsoutheast, maybe pushing a boulder from the southeast direction towards there. But the boulder at (38,12) is southeast of me. If I can get to it, maybe push it south.

But to reach (38,12), I need to go east, but there are bars blocking that path. So that's not possible.

Therefore, the best option might be to move west to (36,11), then push the boulder west or south.

Let me try that: west to (36,11), then push west to (35,11). If that's clear, then the boulder would move west, possibly towards the fountain at westsouthwest.

But I need to check if there are barriers in (35,11). The language observation says dark area very near southwest, west, and northwest. So (35,11) might be in a dark area, but that's okay as long as there's no obstacle.

Alternatively, pushing the boulder south from (36,11) to (36,12). Let's see if that's possible.

So, the plan is:

1. Move west to (36,11).
2. Push the boulder west to (35,11).
3. Continue pushing west until it reaches the fountain.

But I need to confirm the observations after each step.

Given that the previous attempts to push resulted in errors, maybe the correct action now is to move west and then push west.

Let's see. The goal is to push the boulders onto the fountains. The agent is at (36,11). There's a boulder adjacent to the west. The message says ""With great effort you move the boulder"" after the previous action of pushing west. The cursor is now at (36,11).

Looking at the language observation, the boulder is adjacent to the west. So maybe there's a boulder at (35,11). But after pushing it west, it should move to (34,11), right? Wait, but the cursor is now at (36,11). Wait, no—the agent moved west to (36,11), and the boulder was adjacent west, so pushing west would move the boulder to (35,11). But the cursor is at (36,11) after moving.

The map shows that at (36,11), there's now a `@` which is the agent. The `#` symbols are walls or obstacles. The `}` might be a fountain. The `<` is the exit, probably the stairs down. The `@.` indicates the agent's position with a dot nearby, maybe a floor.

The fountains are near southsoutheast and south. The boulder very near eastsoutheast. So maybe the agent needs to get the boulder to the fountain at southsoutheast. 

But the agent is at (36,11). The boulder was pushed west to (35,11). Now, the agent can continue pushing it further west, or maybe move south to reach the fountain. Alternatively, check if there's another boulder nearby that needs to be moved.

Looking at the language observation: ""boulder adjacent west"" after pushing. So after pushing west, the boulder is now at (35,11), adjacent to the agent's new position (36,11). So the agent can push it again west to (34,11). But need to check if there's space behind the boulder. The map shows that at (34,11), there might be a floor or another obstacle. The bars are far east, so west might be clear.

Alternatively, the agent could move south towards the fountain. The fountain is at southsoutheast, which would be directionally southeast from the agent's current position. Wait, the agent is at (36,11). Moving south would take them to (36,12), and then east to (37,12), which has a fountain very near there. Maybe the boulder needs to be pushed into that area.

But the boulder is now at (35,11). If the agent moves south to (36,12), then east to (37,12), they could position to push the boulder south or east. Alternatively, push the boulder west again towards (34,11) and then see if there's a path to a fountain.

Alternatively, check if the boulder at (35,11) can be pushed south into a fountain. But the fountain is at southsoutheast, which would be (38,13) perhaps. Not sure. The map's exact layout is a bit unclear with all the ##########, but the `<` is at (x=35, y=11) in previous maps? Wait, no, the cursor's position is (36,11) now.

The key is to get the boulder onto a fountain. The agent just pushed one boulder west. Now, maybe continue pushing it further or move to another boulder. The language observation mentions ""boulder very near eastsoutheast"". So there's another boulder in that direction. Maybe the agent needs to go there and push that one towards the fountain at southeast.

But the agent is currently at (36,11). To reach eastsoutheast, they'd need to move east and south. Let's think step by step.

Current position: (36,11)
Boulder at (35,11) after being pushed west.
Another boulder very near eastsoutheast, which would be around (38,13) perhaps.
The fountain is near southsoutheast, maybe (37,13) or similar.

So maybe the agent should first finish moving the current boulder. If they push it west again to (34,11), then check if that's towards a fountain. If not, then move to the other boulder at eastsoutheast.

Alternatively, move south to (36,12), then east to (37,12), which has a fountain very near. If there's a boulder in that area, push it east into the fountain.

But according to the latest language observation, the boulder very near eastsoutheast. Maybe that's at (37,13). If the agent moves east to (37,11), then south to (37,12), they can check for that boulder.

Alternatively, the agent could move south to (36,12), then east to (37,12), where there's a fountain very near. If there's a boulder there, push it into the fountain.

Wait, the latest observation says ""fountain very near south and west"". The agent is at (36,11). South would be (36,12), which might have a fountain. So moving south to (36,12), then east to (37,12) where the fountain is. If there's a boulder in that path, push it.

But the current boulder is at (35,11). The agent could push it further west, then move to the other boulder.

Alternatively, since the agent just pushed a boulder west and succeeded, maybe continue pushing it until it's near a fountain.

But I need to look at the map again. The map shows:

At y=11, the line is #`@.######. So position (36,11) is the `@`, and the `.` is adjacent west at (35,11), which is the boulder that was just pushed. The `#`s are to the west of that. So the boulder is at (35,11), and pushing it further west would go into the `#`s, which are obstacles. So can't push it further west.

So the agent can't push that boulder anymore. Need to move to another boulder.

The language observation mentions ""boulder very near eastsoutheast"". So eastsoutheast of the agent's current position (36,11) would be around (37,12) or (38,13). Let's check the map.

In the map, the line for y=11 is #`@.######. So positions (34,11) to (39,11) are mostly `#` except for the `@` at (36,11) and `.` at (35,11). So east of (36,11) is `#`, so can't go east directly. So the agent might need to move south to access the other boulder.

Moving south to (36,12), the line is #{..`#####. So at (36,12), there's a `#`, which is a wall. So can't move south directly. Wait, the agent is at (36,11), moving south to (36,12) would be into the `#` at that position. So that's blocked. Hmm.

Alternative path: move west to (35,11), but that's where the boulder is now. Or move north? The previous position was (36,12) north of here. But moving north would take the agent back to (36,12), which is a wall. So maybe the agent is trapped?

Wait, the cursor is at (36,11), and the map line for y=11 is #`@.######. So positions 34-39 on y=11 are `#` except for (35,11) which is `.` (the boulder after being pushed) and (36,11) which is `@`. So the agent is surrounded by walls to the west, north, and east. The only way out is south, but (36,12) is a `#`. So stuck?

But that can't be right. The agent must have a way to move. Let me check the map again.

Wait, looking at the map:

At y=11:
- The line is #`@.######. So breaking it down per x-coordinate:
x=34: #
x=35: `
x=36: @
x=37: .
x=38: #
x=39: ###### (but perhaps truncated as ##########?)

Wait, maybe the map is wider. But given the structure, the agent is at (36,11) with walls to the north (y=10 is ##########, so same as others), east (x=37 is #), south is y=12 which starts with #`..`#####, so at (36,12) it's `#`. So the agent is in a corridor that's blocked on three sides. How did they get here?

Perhaps the previous actions led them here. The agent pushed the boulder west, ending up here. Now they need to find another way.

Alternatively, maybe the agent can move the boulder at (35,11) south into a fountain. But the boulder is at (35,11). Moving it south would require the agent to be adjacent south. The agent is at (36,11), so to push the boulder south, the agent needs to move south and then push. But the agent can't move south because (36,12) is a wall. So can't do that.

Alternatively, the agent can move west to (35,11), which is the boulder, but that's not a valid move unless they push it again. But the boulder is already there; pushing it again would require space behind it. The map shows that at (34,11) is a `#`, so can't push further west.

This seems like a dead end. Maybe the agent needs to go back north to the previous position. But north at (36,11) is y=10, which is ##########, so a wall. So the agent is trapped between walls to the north, east, and south, and the boulder to the west.

But that can't be the case. There must be a way out. Let me double-check the map.

Looking at the map provided:

Line for y=11: #`@.########## (but the exact representation might be cut off). The important part is that at (36,11) is the agent, (35,11) is the boulder (after being pushed), and to the west of (35,11) is a `#`, so a wall. To the east is a `#`, and south is a `#`. North is also a wall. So the agent is in a 1x1 room with a boulder? That doesn't make sense. Probably a mistake in parsing the map.

Alternatively, maybe the map has more space. The line for y=11 is ""#`@.######"", which could be interpreted as:

x=34: #
x=35: `
x=36: @
x=37: .
x=38: #
x=39: ######

But this is just a guess. Maybe the agent can move west to (35,11), which is the boulder, but that's occupied. So the only possible move is to push the boulder further west, but it's blocked by a wall. Therefore, the agent is stuck.

But since the game allows movement, perhaps there's a different interpretation. Maybe the `.` at (35,11) is not a boulder but a floor, and the boulder is elsewhere. Wait, the message said ""With great effort you move the boulder,"" so after pushing west, the boulder is now at (35,11), and the `.` indicates the new position of the agent? No, the agent's position is `@`, and the `.` is a floor tile.

This is confusing. Let's try to focus on the language observations. The latest observation says:

- boulder adjacent west (to the agent's position at (36,11)), so at (35,11)
- boulder very near eastsoutheast, which would be around (38,13) perhaps
- fountain very near south and west. South of (36,11) is (36,12), which might have a fountain.

But the agent can't move south due to the wall. So maybe the agent needs to move north, but that's also a wall. Alternatively, there's a mistake in the map parsing.

Alternatively, the agent can move the boulder at (35,11) south into a fountain. But to do that, the agent would need to move south to (36,12), which is a wall. So that's not possible.

Hmm. Maybe the correct action is to move west to the boulder at (35,11) and try to push it in another direction. But since pushing west is blocked, maybe push it south. But the agent is at (36,11), so to push the boulder south, the agent needs to move south first. But can't.

This seems like a dead end. Perhaps the agent needs to explore other areas. Since there's another boulder eastsoutheast, the agent could move there. To get there, the agent would need to go north, but y=10 is all walls. So stuck.

Wait, maybe the agent can move east through the `#####` in the map. For example, at y=12, the line is ""#{..`#####"". So at (36,12) it's a `#`, but maybe further east. The agent is at (36,11). If they move east, they hit a `#` at (37,11). So no.

This is perplexing. The agent might be trapped, but that's unlikely. Perhaps there's a mistake in the observations or map parsing. Given the constraints, the best possible action is to try to move the boulder again in a valid direction or navigate to another boulder.

Since the agent can't push the current boulder further west, maybe move south to find another path. But movement south is blocked. Alternatively, move north, but that's a wall. 

Wait, the initial position was (36,12) before moving south. Let me check the previous steps. The agent moved east to (36,12), then tried to push west, etc. Now they're back at (36,11) with the boulder at (35,11). Maybe the agent should try to move east again, but that's blocked by a wall.

Alternatively, maybe the agent can move the boulder at (35,11) north. But the agent is at (36,11), so to push the boulder north, they need to move north. But (36,10) is part of the ########## line, which is a wall. So no.

This is a tricky situation. Given the available actions and observations, the only possible move that doesn't hit a wall is to move west to (35,11), but that's the boulder. Alternatively, the agent could try to move east, but it's blocked. 

Wait, the language observation says ""bars very near north, northnortheast, northeast, eastnortheast, east, southeast, northwest, and northnorthwest"". So there are bars in many directions, which are probably unpassable obstacles. 

The only viable action might be to move south, but it's blocked. Therefore, the agent is stuck. But since the game requires an action, perhaps the only possible thing is to move west into the boulder, but that's not a valid action (can't move into a boulder unless pushing).

Wait, the agent is at (36,11), and the boulder is at (35,11). So the agent can move west to (35,11) if it's a floor, but since there's a boulder there, they can't. Therefore, the only possible action is to push the boulder in a valid direction. But all directions are blocked. 

This must mean there's an error in the previous steps. Perhaps the agent should have moved differently earlier. But given the current state, the only possible action is to try to move west again, but it's blocked. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent can move south into a different part of the map. But as per the map, y=12 at x=36 is a `#`. So no.

Given this impasse, the only possible action is to move west, even though it's occupied by a boulder, but that's not allowed. Therefore, the agent must wait or find another way. 

But the game expects an action. Perhaps the correct action is to move west despite the boulder, but that's invalid. Alternatively, there's a misunderstanding in the map parsing. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent can move the boulder at (35,11) east into a different position. But the agent is at (36,11), so to push the boulder east, they need to move east first. But (37,11) is a `#`, so can't. 

I'm stuck. Given the current observations, the best possible action is to move west, but it's blocked by the boulder. The only other option is to move south, which is blocked. Therefore, the agent must have made a mistake earlier, but since the game requires an action, I'll have to choose the only possible valid move, which is to move south, even though it's a wall. But that would result in an error message. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent can move east into the `#####` area, but that's walls. 

Wait, looking back at the map line for y=11: #`@.######. So after the `@` at (36,11), the next characters are `.######`, which could mean that to the east of (36,11) is a `.` (floor) followed by `#`s. So at (37,11) it's a `.`, which is a floor. Wait, no— the line is #`@.######. So breaking it down:

x=34: #
x=35: `
x=36: @
x=37: .
x=38: #
x=39: ######

So at (37,11) it's a `.` (floor), and (38,11) is a `#`. So the agent can move east from (36,11) to (37,11), which is a floor. That's possible! I must have miscounted earlier. 

Yes! So the agent is at (36,11), and to the east is (37,11), which is a `.` (floor), not a wall. The previous assumption that it's a `#` was incorrect due to misparsing the map line. So the agent can move east to (37,11), which is a valid floor tile. 

Now, at (37,11), what's nearby? The language observation says ""boulder very near eastsoutheast"". Eastsoutheast of (37,11) would be (38,12). Also, ""fountain very near south and west"". South of (37,11) is (37,12), which is part of the line `#{..`#####`, so at (37,12) it's a `#`, which is a wall. West of (37,11)","

Your previous output did not contain a valid action. Defaulted to action: north

83,push west,"<reasoning>
I need to figure out the next move in this Boxoban game. Let me start by understanding the current situation based on the observation.

The agent (me) is at position (36, 11). The map has a lot of bars, which are probably obstacles that can't be passed through. There's a boulder nearby to the west (since the boulder is adjacent west in the language observation). The goal is to push the boulders onto the fountains. Looking at the map, there's a fountain near southsoutheast and another one adjacent southwest. 

The previous actions tried pushing the boulder south and east, but there were issues with bars blocking the way. Now, the cursor is at (36,11) after moving west earlier. The message says ""You cannot pass through the bars,"" which probably means there's a bar in the way when trying to move south again. 

The language observation mentions that the boulder is adjacent west. So, if I move west again, I might be able to push the boulder further. Alternatively, since there's a fountain to the southwest, maybe pushing the boulder in that direction would work. 

Wait, the boulder is west of the agent's current position. If I move west again, I would be next to the boulder. Then, pushing the boulder west might move it towards the fountain. But I need to check if there's space behind the boulder. The observation says the boulder is adjacent west, so the agent is next to it. To push the boulder, I need to move in the direction opposite to where I want the boulder to go. For example, to push the boulder west, the agent would need to move west into the boulder, which would push it further west. 

Looking at the map, after moving west to (36,11), the boulder is adjacent west. So if I do ""push west"" again, the boulder would move to (35,11), and the agent would move to (35,11) as well. But I need to make sure that there's no obstacle behind the boulder. The language observation says there's a dark area very near southwest, west, and northwest. So, after pushing the boulder west to (35,11), is there a fountain there? The fountain is adjacent southwest, which might be at (34,10) or similar. Hmm, maybe not directly. Alternatively, pushing the boulder further west could get it closer to a fountain. 

Alternatively, maybe moving south to (36,12) and then pushing the boulder south could work. But there are bars south, which are obstacles. So that might not be possible. 

Another idea: the stairs up are near eastsoutheast, but I don't think the goal is to go upstairs yet. The priority is to push the boulder onto a fountain. The fountain near southsoutheast is probably the target. 

Wait, the language observation says ""fountain very near southsoutheast."" So maybe pushing the boulder in that direction. But how? If the agent is at (36,11), moving east might lead towards the stairs and bars, but the boulder is to the west. Maybe pushing the boulder south-southwest? But the agent's current position is (36,11). If they move south to (36,12), but there's a bar there, so that's blocked. 

Alternatively, after moving west and then pushing west again, the boulder would move to (35,11). Then, from there, maybe push it south or southwest towards the fountain. But need to check the map layout. 

Looking at the map, the agent's current position is at x=36, y=11. The boulder is adjacent west (x=35, y=11). If the agent does ""push west"", the boulder would move to (34,11), and the agent would move to (35,11). Then, check if there's a fountain at (34,11) or nearby. The fountain is adjacent southwest, which could be at (33,10) or (34,10). If the boulder is moved to (34,11), maybe that's closer to a fountain. 

Alternatively, perhaps pushing the boulder southwest. But how to do that? The agent would need to move southwest, but that's a diagonal direction, which isn't allowed. The actions are only north, south, east, west. So, to push the boulder southwest, the agent would have to move south then west, or west then south, but each movement would push the boulder in one direction. 

Given the current position and the obstacles (bars), the safest bet might be to push the boulder west again to get it closer to the fountain. Let's try that. So the next action should be ""push west"".

84,push west,"<reasoning>
I need to figure out where to go next in this Boxoban level. Let me start by understanding the current situation.

The agent is a samurai at position (36, 11). The map has a lot of bars blocking paths, which probably means walls or obstacles. There's a boulder adjacent to the west, so maybe that's the one I need to push. The goal is to push all boulders onto fountains. Looking at the observations, there's a fountain very near southsoutheast and south. The boulder was previously at southsoutheast, but after pushing west earlier, it might have moved. 

The latest message says ""You cannot pass through the bars,"" which means I tried to move into a wall. The cursor is back at (36,11), and the boulder is adjacent to the west. So the boulder is at (35,11). The fountain is southsoutheast, which would be towards the east and south. But the current position is blocked by bars to the east and south. 

Wait, the language observation mentions a fountain adjacent southwest. The agent is at (36,11). Southwest direction from there would be (35,10). Is there a fountain there? The observation says ""fountain adjacent southwest,"" so maybe (35,10) is a fountain. The boulder adjacent west is at (35,11). If I can push the boulder southwest to (35,10), which is a fountain, that would solve the problem. 

To push the boulder southwest, I need to move into the boulder from the west direction. So the action should be ""push west"" again. But wait, the previous attempts to push south or east resulted in errors because of bars. Let me check the map again. The map shows a lot of ########## which are probably walls. The agent's position is near some bars. 

Looking at the cursor's position (36,11), moving west would take the agent to (35,11), which has the boulder. To push the boulder southwest, the agent needs to move into the boulder from the west and then direction. Wait, Boxoban requires that you push by walking into the boulder, and there must be space behind it. So if the boulder is at (35,11), pushing it southwest would mean the agent moves west into the boulder, and then the boulder moves southwest (to (35,10)), which should be a fountain. 

But the problem is that the agent is already adjacent to the boulder west. So the correct action should be ""push west"" again, which would move the boulder to the southwest (if there's space). However, the previous attempts to push south or east resulted in the agent hitting bars. Let me confirm the map layout. 

The map shows at position (35,11) there's a boulder, and at (35,10) there's a fountain. The agent is at (36,11). So if the agent pushes the boulder west (from (36,11) to (35,11)), then the boulder would move to (35,10), which is the fountain. That would solve the puzzle. 

But why did previous push actions fail? Maybe the direction was incorrect. The agent needs to push the boulder in the direction they want it to move. So to push the boulder southwest, the agent should move west into it, causing the boulder to move west (to (35,11)), but that's not southwest. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up directions. 

In Boxoban, pushing a boulder south would mean the agent moves south, and the boulder moves south. So if the agent is at (36,11) and pushes south, the boulder would go to (36,10). But the fountain is at (35,10). Hmm. Alternatively, if the agent is at (36,11) and wants to push the boulder southwest, they need to move west into it, which would push the boulder to the west (35,11), but that's not southwest. Maybe the correct direction is to push the boulder south, then west? 

Wait, maybe the boulder is at (35,11). The agent is at (36,11). To push the boulder southwest, the agent needs to move into the boulder from the west, which would push it to the southwest (35,10). So the correct action is ""push west"". Let me check the previous steps. Earlier, the agent tried ""push west"" but it defaulted to north because the action was invalid. Why? Maybe there was a typo or the system didn't recognize ""push west"" as a valid action. 

Looking back at the action list provided: the valid actions are north, east, south, west. The user initially tried ""push west"", but the system said it's invalid. According to the problem statement, the possible actions are only the four directions. Pushing is done by moving into the boulder, so the correct action is to move in the direction you want the boulder to go. For example, to push a boulder south, you move south into it. 

Ah, right! In Boxoban, you don't have a separate ""push"" action. You just move in the direction of the boulder, and if there's space behind it, the boulder moves there. So to push the boulder southwest (which would be south then west), the agent needs to first move south into the boulder, but the problem is the bars are blocking the south. 

Looking at the current map, the agent is at (36,11). Moving south would take them to (36,10), but the observation says there are bars very near north, northeast, etc., and the message says ""You cannot pass through the bars"" when trying to move south. So the path south is blocked. 

Therefore, the only way to push the boulder is to move west into it, which would push the boulder to (35,11). But that's not towards the fountain. The fountain is at (35,10). So perhaps after pushing the boulder west to (35,11), the agent can then move south to (35,10) and push it further? But south from (35,11) is blocked by bars. 

Wait, the fountain is adjacent southwest to the agent's current position. So the fountain is at (35,10). The boulder is at (35,11). If the agent can push the boulder west to (35,11) (which they are already adjacent to), and then move south into it, but the path is blocked. Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to push the boulder south first. 

But south from (36,11) is blocked by bars. So the only possible move is west to push the boulder to (35,11), but that doesn't help reach the fountain. Hmm. 

Wait, maybe the boulder is already at (35,11), and the agent needs to push it south into the fountain. But the agent is at (36,11). To push the boulder south, the agent needs to move south into it. However, moving south from (36,11) is blocked by bars. So that's not possible. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent should move east to get a better position. But east is blocked by bars. The only open direction is west, but pushing west just moves the boulder sideways, not towards the fountain. 

This is confusing. Let me re-express the goal: the boulder needs to be on the fountain at (35,10). The current boulder is at (35,11). So the agent needs to push it one step south to (35,10). But the agent is at (36,11). To push the boulder south, the agent must move south into it. However, moving south from (36,11) is blocked by bars. Therefore, the agent cannot push the boulder south directly. 

Is there another way? Maybe the agent needs to rearrange the boulder by pushing it west first, then east, then south? But west pushes it to (35,11), east would push it back, and south is blocked. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a different boulder. The observations mention a boulder very near south. Let me check the language observation again: ""boulder very near south"" and ""boulder adjacent northeast"". The agent is at (36,11). The boulder adjacent northeast would be at (37,12). But pushing that wouldn't help the fountain at (35,10). 

The main boulder to worry about is the one at (35,11) near the agent. The fountain is at (35,10). So the only way is to push the boulder south into the fountain, but the path is blocked. Unless there's a way to move around the bars. 

Looking at the map, the agent is at (36,11). The bars are very near north, northeast, etc. Maybe there's a different path. If the agent moves north, but that's also blocked by bars. 

This seems like a dead end. Maybe the initial approach was wrong. Perhaps the agent needs to find another boulder or navigate differently. But according to the observations, the main boulder is the one at (35,11). 

Wait, the message after pushing west says ""With great effort you move the boulder."" So the previous push west did move the boulder to (35,11). Now, the agent is at (36,11), and the boulder is at (35,11). The fountain is at (35,10). So now, the agent can move south into the boulder? But south is blocked by bars. 

Alternatively, the agent could move east to (37,11), but that's blocked by bars. 

This is tricky. Maybe the solution is to push the boulder west again, but that just moves it back. 

Wait, perhaps the agent should move north? But north is blocked. 

I'm stuck. Maybe I need to try a different approach. Let's look at the map again. The agent is at (36,11). The map shows a series of ########## which are probably walls. The bars are part of the walls. The cursor's position is on a '.' which is probably a floor. 

The only open directions are west (to the boulder) and maybe north or south if there's a path. But the observations say the agent can't pass through bars when moving south. 

Perhaps the correct action is to move west into the boulder again, but that would just move it back to where it was. 

Wait, maybe the boulder needs to be pushed to the southeast. The fountain is southsoutheast. So if the agent pushes the boulder east and then south, but east is blocked. 

Alternatively, the agent could push the boulder southwest, but that requires moving west into it, which would place it at (35,11), and then somehow moving it south. But the path is blocked. 

I think the only possible valid action here is to try pushing the boulder west again, even though it might not solve the problem, but it's the only available option that doesn't result in an error. Alternatively, maybe the agent should move north, but that's blocked. 

Wait, the latest observation after moving west previously had the message ""You cannot pass through the bars"" when trying to move north. So north is blocked. 

Given the constraints, the only valid action that doesn't hit a wall is to push the boulder west. Even though it seems like it's not solving the problem, maybe there's a step I'm missing. 

Alternatively, perhaps the agent needs to move to a different position to access the boulder. But given the current layout, all other directions are blocked by bars. 

In conclusion, the only possible valid action is to push the boulder west, which is the only direction that doesn't result in an error. So the chosen action should be ""push west"".

Let's see where I am right now. The agent is at (36, 11). The previous actions tried to push the boulder west but failed because there are bars blocking the way. The message says ""You cannot pass through the bars,"" so I need to find another way.

Looking at the map, there are bars all around the area, especially to the east and south. The boulder is adjacent to the west, but pushing it further west is blocked by bars. The goal is to push the boulder onto the fountain. 

The closest fountain seems to be to the south. Maybe I can move the boulder south instead. Let's check the observations again. The boulder is at (37, 11) or nearby. If I can move south, perhaps I can push the boulder towards the southeast fountain. 

Wait, the language observation mentions a fountain very near eastsoutheast and southeast. So maybe moving the boulder towards the southeast would work. The agent is currently at (36, 11). If I move south to (36, 12), then try to push the boulder south-east towards the fountain.

But first, I need to check if there's a clear path. The bars are adjacent to north, northeast, and northwest, so moving south might be possible. Let me try moving south once and see. If that's allowed, then push the boulder south or southeast.

Alternatively, maybe the boulder can be pushed east first, but east is blocked by bars. So the best option is to move south to position (36, 12) and then try to push the boulder south towards the fountain. Let me check the map again for obstacles. The map shows bars very near north, northeast, etc., but south might be clearer.

So step by step: first, move south to get next to the boulder. Then, push the boulder south towards the fountain. That should work. Let's test that.

I need to figure out how to push the boulder onto the fountain in this Boxoban-like game. Let's look at the current observation.

The agent is at position (36, 12). The map shows several barriers (bars) around, some dark areas, and a fountain to the southeast. There's a boulder very near east, southeast, and southsouthwest. The goal is to push the boulder onto a fountain.

Looking at the language observation, there's a fountain adjacent to southeast and west. The boulder is adjacent to northwest. Maybe the boulder is nearby, and I need to push it towards the southeast fountain.

The agent's current position is (36,12). If I move east to (37,12), but there are bars there. Earlier attempts to push east or south resulted in messages about bars blocking the way. So maybe the boulder is to the west or north?

Wait, the boulder is very near east, southeast, and southsouthwest. So maybe the boulder is to the east of the agent's current position. But the agent tried pushing east before and got a ""You cannot pass through the bars"" message. That suggests there's a bar in the way, blocking the path to the boulder.

Alternatively, maybe the boulder is north of the agent. Let me check the map again. The map shows some characters like '#', '.', '`', and '<'. The '<' likely represents the agent's position. The line with @ is probably the agent. The boulder is denoted by 'o' perhaps? Wait, the map in the observation shows:

In the map section, there's a line with #{@.`##### which might mean the agent is at (36,12) since the cursor is there. The boulder is mentioned in the language observation as very near east, southeast, and southsouthwest. So maybe there's a 'o' to the east or southeast.

But in the map provided, the symbols are mostly '#' which are walls or barriers. The '<' is the agent. So perhaps the boulder is adjacent but blocked by bars. The agent needs to navigate around the bars to reach the boulder.

Another approach: since the boulder is near east, maybe the agent should try to move east first, but the bars are blocking. Alternatively, move south to get around the blocks and then push the boulder east when possible.

Wait, the agent was previously at (37,12) and tried pushing south but couldn't due to bars. Then moved back west to (36,12). The boulder is near east, so perhaps the agent needs to move east past the bars. But the bars are blocking. Maybe the boulder is behind a bar, so the agent has to find a path to get next to the boulder.

Alternatively, maybe the boulder is on the other side of the bars, and the agent needs to move in a direction where they can push it towards the fountain. The fountain is adjacent to southeast and west. So if the boulder is pushed to the southeast, it would reach the fountain.

Looking at the cursor position (36,12), to the southeast would be (37,13) or similar. If the agent can push the boulder east and then south, that might get it to the fountain.

But earlier attempts to push east resulted in errors. Maybe the boulder is not immediately east but requires moving north or south first. Let me check the map again. The agent is at (36,12). The map's fourth line from the top is #`..###### which might be the agent's row. The '@' is the agent, so in that line, the agent is at position 36 (assuming each '#' is a tile). The line is #`..######, which could mean the agent is at the third position (if counting from the start of the line). So moving east would be into the next tile, which is a '.' or something. But the language observation says there are bars near east.

This is a bit confusing. The key points are:

- Boulder is very near east, southeast, southsouthwest.
- Fountain is adjacent southeast and west.
- Bars are blocking movement east and south.

So the agent needs to find a way to get next to the boulder without hitting bars. Maybe move south to get around the bars, then east. Or move north to see if there's a path.

Alternatively, the agent could try pushing the boulder south if possible. But the message says ""You cannot pass through the bars,"" so maybe the boulder is behind a bar and can't be moved in that direction.

Another idea: the boulder is adjacent to northwest. If the agent moves west, they might be able to get next to the boulder from the west side and push it east. The agent is currently at (36,12). Moving west to (35,12) might allow accessing the boulder from the west. Then push east towards the fountain.

But the language observation says the boulder is adjacent to northwest, which would be the tile north-west of the agent's current position. So the agent is at (36,12), northwest would be (35,11). If there's a boulder there, the agent could move west to (35,12) and then north to (35,11) to get next to the boulder, then push it east.

Wait, the agent's current position is (36,12). The boulder is adjacent to northwest, which is (35,11). So to get there, the agent would need to move west to (35,12), then north to (35,11). But are there bars in those paths?

Looking at the map's fourth line: #`..######. The agent is at (36,12), which is the position of the '@'. The line is #`..######, so moving west from (36,12) would go into the '.' at (35,12), which is probably passable. Then moving north to (35,11) would be into the '`' character. Not sure if that's a barrier. If it's a barrier, the agent can't go there.

Alternatively, maybe the agent can move north from (36,12) to (36,11). Looking at the map's third line: ##########, which is all bars. So moving north is blocked. Moving south to (36,13): the fifth line is #{..`#####. The agent is at (36,12), moving south would be into the '{' perhaps, which might be a floor tile. So that could be possible.

So the plan could be:

1. Move south to (36,13).
2. From there, move east towards the boulder, avoiding bars.
3. Once next to the boulder, push it east towards the fountain.

But need to check if the path is clear. From (36,13), moving east would be into the '#' in the fifth line's #{..`#####. So that's a bar. Alternatively, move east from (36,13) to (37,13), which is part of the '#####' sequence, which are bars. So that's blocked.

Alternatively, move north from (36,13) back to (36,12), then west to (35,12), then north to (35,11) to reach the boulder's adjacent position. But the map's fourth line at (35,11) is part of the '######' which are bars. So that's not possible.

Hmm. Maybe the boulder is actually at (37,13) or similar. Let me re-examine the language observation. It says the boulder is very near east, southeast, and southsouthwest of the agent's current position (36,12). So east would be (37,12), southeast (37,13), southsouthwest (35,13). If there's a boulder at (37,12), but the agent can't move east due to bars, then perhaps the boulder is behind a bar and needs to be pushed from another direction.

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to move south to (36,13) and then east to (37,13), but that's a bar. This is getting complicated. Another approach: since the agent pushed a boulder west earlier and moved to (36,11), maybe there's a boulder there that needs to be moved. But the latest observations show the boulder is near east.

Wait, in the last valid action, the agent moved west and pushed a boulder, ending up at (36,11). The message said ""With great effort you move the boulder."" So maybe that boulder was to the east of the agent's previous position (37,11). Now the boulder is at (36,11), and the agent is at (36,11). But the cursor is now at (36,12) again after some movements. Maybe I'm getting confused with the positions.

Alternatively, the agent needs to find the boulder and push it towards the fountain. The fountain is adjacent to southeast and west. If the boulder is pushed to the southeast, it would reach the fountain. To do that, the agent might need to move east and then south, but there are bars blocking. So perhaps the agent needs to find a path around the bars to get behind the boulder and push it in the desired direction.

Given the complexity, maybe the best action is to try moving east again, but considering the bars. If moving east is blocked by bars, try moving south to find a clear path. Alternatively, move north if possible, but the third line is all bars. So moving north from (36,12) is impossible.

Another possibility: the agent can push the boulder south. If the boulder is at (37,11), pushing it south to (37,12) might clear a path or move it towards the fountain. But the agent is at (36,12), so to push the boulder south, the agent would need to be north of it. If the boulder is at (37,11), the agent is west of it. To push it south, the agent would have to move east to (37,12), but that's blocked by bars. This is tricky.

Wait, after pushing the boulder west earlier, the agent was at (36,11). The boulder would be at (35,11) if pushed west. Then the agent moved back to (36,11) via north? Not sure. The latest valid observation after pushing west had the agent at (36,11), but then the next observation after that defaulted to north and the agent was back at (36,11) with a message about bars. Maybe the boulder is now at (36,11), and the agent is trying to push it further west, but there's a bar blocking.

In any case, the agent needs to navigate around the bars to reach the boulder. Since moving east and south is blocked, perhaps the best move is to move north, but that's all bars. Move west to (35,12), then see if there's a path. From (35,12), moving north to (35,11) might be possible if it's not a bar. If that's a passable tile, the agent can go there and then push the boulder east.

Given the information, the next action could be to move west to (35,12) and then explore from there. Alternatively, try pushing the boulder south if possible.

But given the previous attempts and the barriers, the safest action might be to move south to (36,13) and see if there's a path east from there. Let's check the map's fifth line: #{..`#####. At (36,13), the tile is '{', which might be a floor. Moving east from (36,13) would be into the '#' which is a bar. So that's not helpful.

Alternatively, move west to (35,12), then north to (35,11). The map's fourth line at (35,11) is part of the '######' which are bars. So that's blocked.

Hmm. This is challenging. Given the current position and the obstacles, perhaps the best immediate action is to try moving east again, even though there are bars, maybe there's a way through. Or move south to (36,13) and then try pushing the boulder from there.

Another angle: the fountain is adjacent to west. If the boulder can be pushed west towards the fountain, that would solve the problem. But the agent is at (36,12), and pushing west would take the boulder to (35,12), which might be near the fountain. The language observation says the fountain is adjacent to west, so (35,12) could be next to the fountain.

If the boulder is at (35,12), pushing it west would place it on the fountain. But how to get the boulder there? The agent would need to be east of the boulder. If the boulder is at (35,12), the agent is at (36,12). So pushing west would require the agent to move into the boulder, which is possible if the space west of the boulder is the fountain.

Wait, the agent is at (36,12). If the boulder is at (35,12), then the agent can push it west to (34,12), but the fountain is adjacent to west, which would be (35,11) or something. This is getting too vague without seeing the exact map layout.

Given the uncertainty, perhaps the best action is to move west to (35,12) and attempt to push the boulder from there. If that's possible, then pushing west could move the boulder towards the fountain.

So the chosen action is west.

Let's try to figure out what the best move is here. The agent is playing Boxoban, so the goal is to push all the boulders onto the fountains. Let's look at the current observation.

The cursor position is (35, 12). The map shows some bars and a boulder nearby. The language observation mentions a boulder very near north and a fountain very near eastsoutheast and southeast. Also, there's a stairs up far eastsoutheast, which might be important for exiting once all boulders are in place.

Looking at the map, the agent is facing a bunch of bars to the east and northeast. The boulder is adjacent to the north, so if I move north, I might be able to push it. But wait, the message says there's a boulder very near north. Let me check the adjacent positions. The boulder is adjacent north, so maybe it's right above the agent's current position.

The agent's current inventory has a katana and some yumi arrows, but pushing the boulder would require moving into it. The key is to push the boulder towards a fountain. The fountains are near eastsoutheast and southeast. So if I can push the boulder south or east, that would be good.

But moving east is blocked by bars. Moving south might be possible. Wait, the agent just came from the east (previous actions were east, push south, etc.) and is now at (35,12). The boulder is adjacent north, which would be at (35,11). So if I move north, I can potentially push the boulder south into a fountain.

Alternatively, moving west might help reposition, but the bars are to the west and southwest. Maybe moving north to push the boulder south towards the southeast fountain. Let me confirm the positions. The fountain is very near eastsoutheast and southeast. If the boulder is at (35,11), pushing it south to (35,12) would place it on a fountain? Wait, the current position (35,12) is the agent's location, so the boulder is at (35,11). If the agent moves north, they would be at (35,11), and then push the boulder south to (35,12), which is the agent's current spot. That doesn't help. Maybe the fountain is at (35,13) or somewhere else.

Wait, looking at the map, the fountains are adjacent to eastsoutheast and south. The agent's current position is (35,12). If the boulder is at (35,11), pushing it south to (35,12) might not be onto a fountain. Maybe there's a fountain south of that. Let me check the language observation again. The fountain is very near eastsoutheast and south. So perhaps the fountain is at (36,13) or similar. 

Alternatively, pushing the boulder east into the area with the fountain. But the bars are blocking east. The only way might be to navigate around the bars. The agent could move west to get a better angle. But the bars are also to the west. 

Wait, the message says there's a boulder adjacent north. So if the agent moves north, they would be next to the boulder. Then, pushing the boulder south into a fountain. Let's see: if the agent is at (35,12), moves north to (35,11), then pushes south, the boulder would move to (35,12), which is the agent's current position. That doesn't make sense. Maybe the agent needs to move the boulder in another direction. 

Alternatively, the boulder could be pushed east if there's a path. But the bars are to the east. Maybe the agent needs to move west to find a way around. Let's think. The agent was previously moving east, then tried pushing south, but hit bars. Now at (35,12). The boulder is north. If the agent moves west to (34,12), then maybe they can push the boulder north or south. But the bars are to the west, so moving west might be blocked. 

Wait, the language observation says bars very near north, northnortheast, northeast, southsouthwest, and northnorthwest. So the agent is surrounded by bars on the north and west sides. The only open directions might be east and south. But east is blocked by bars. South is possible. 

Wait, the agent was at (37,12) before moving west to (36,12), then to (35,12). The current position is (35,12). The boulder is adjacent north at (35,11). If the agent moves north to (35,11), then pushes south, the boulder would go to (35,12), but that's where the agent is. So that's not helpful. Maybe the agent needs to push the boulder east. But how? The agent is at (35,12), east is (36,12), which might be blocked by bars. 

Alternatively, the agent could move south to (35,13), then see if there's a path. But looking at the map, the agent's current position is in a corridor with bars on the north and west. The only way might be to navigate around. 

Wait, the stairs up are far eastsoutheast. Once all boulders are on fountains, the agent can use the stairs to exit. But first, need to push the boulder to a fountain. 

Another approach: since the boulder is adjacent north, the agent can move north into it and push south. But as before, that would place the boulder on the agent's current spot. Maybe the agent needs to push it further south. If the agent moves south first, then north into the boulder, but that might not help. 

Alternatively, maybe the boulder can be pushed east into a clear spot. Let me check the map again. At (35,12), east is (36,12). Looking at the map, the east direction from (35,12) is likely blocked by bars. The language observation says bars are very near north, northnortheast, etc., so east might be blocked. 

Hmm, this is tricky. The agent is surrounded by bars on the north and west, and the boulder is north. The only open directions seem to be east and south, but east is blocked. Maybe the agent should move south to (35,13) and see if there's a path. From (35,13), maybe they can push the boulder east or west. 

But the current map shows that at (35,13), there might be a continuation of bars. The agent's previous movements indicate that moving east was blocked. So perhaps the best option is to push the boulder south into a fountain. Wait, but where is the fountain exactly? The language observation says fountain very near eastsoutheast and southeast. So maybe the fountain is at (36,13) or (37,13). If the agent can push the boulder to (36,13), that would be onto a fountain. 

To do that, the agent would need to move east, but that's blocked. Alternatively, move south to (35,13), then east. But east from (35,13) is still blocked by bars. 

Alternatively, the agent could move west to (34,12), then see if they can push the boulder north or south. But moving west might be blocked by bars. The language observation says bars are adjacent southwest, west, and northwest. So (34,12) is west of the agent, but there are bars there. 

This is getting complicated. Maybe the best move is to try pushing the boulder north again, even if it doesn't seem helpful. Or perhaps the agent needs to reposition by moving west or south. 

Wait, the agent's previous actions included moving east multiple times, then south, and trying to push. Maybe now, after moving back to (35,12), the best move is to try pushing the boulder west. If the agent moves north to (35,11), then pushes west, the boulder would go to (34,11). But is there a fountain there? The language observation mentions a fountain adjacent southwest. So (34,11) might be near a fountain. 

If the boulder is pushed to (34,11), and there's a fountain at (34,12) or similar, that could work. Let me check the fountain locations. The fountain is adjacent southwest, which would be (34,12) if the agent is at (35,12). So pushing the boulder to (34,11) would place it next to the fountain at (34,12). That might be a good move. 

So the steps would be: move north to (35,11), then push west to (34,11), placing the boulder next to the fountain at (34,12). That would solve the puzzle. 

Therefore, the chosen action is to push west after moving north.

Let me try to figure out what to do next. The agent is in a Boxoban-like game, trying to push boulders onto fountains. The goal is to navigate and move the boulders correctly.

Looking at the current observation, the agent is at position (35, 12). The map has a lot of bars (which are probably walls or obstacles), dark areas, and fountains. There's a boulder near east and eastsoutheast, and a fountain near southsoutheast. The agent previously tried pushing the boulder to the west but failed, probably because there's something blocking the way, like another obstacle or a wall.

The message says ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" So pushing west again won't work. The agent needs to find another direction to push the boulder. Let's check the adjacent areas. To the west of the agent is position (34, 12), which might be a wall or bar based on the language observations. The bars are very near southwest, west, and northwest, so moving west isn't possible.

What about other directions? The agent is at (35, 12). Looking at the map, maybe moving north or south could lead to a path where the boulder can be pushed. The fountains are in the southsoutheast area, so perhaps pushing the boulder towards there. Let's see: the boulder is near east and eastsoutheast. If the agent can move east to get next to the boulder and then push it south or southeast towards the fountain.

But the agent is currently at (35,12). To the east is (36,12), which was previously moved to. The boulder is near east, so maybe the agent needs to go east and then push the boulder. However, the previous attempts to push east resulted in ""You cannot pass through the bars."" So the path east might be blocked by bars.

Wait, the language observation mentions bars very near north, northnortheast, northeast, southsouthwest, and northnorthwest. So moving northeast or southeast might be blocked. The stairs up are far eastsoutheast, which is probably a exit but not immediately useful.

The agent's inventory has a katana, yumi, and some ya arrows, but probably not relevant for moving boulders. The main task is to push the boulder onto the fountain. Since pushing west didn't work, maybe try pushing the boulder in another direction. Let's check the adjacent cells of the boulder. The boulder is near east and eastsoutheast. If the agent moves east to (36,12), which was previously possible, maybe there's a way to push the boulder from there.

Wait, in the previous steps, the agent moved east to (36,12) and then tried pushing south, but there were bars. Maybe the boulder is at (37,12) or nearby. If the agent is at (35,12) and moves east to (36,12), then perhaps from there they can push the boulder south or southeast. But the earlier attempts to push south when at (37,11) failed because of bars. So maybe need to find a different path.

Alternatively, the agent could try moving south to (35,13) and see if there's a way to push the boulder from there. But the map shows that the area below is mostly bars and dark areas. The fountain is in the southsoutheast, so perhaps the boulder needs to be moved towards there.

Another possibility is that the boulder is adjacent to a fountain already, but the observations don't show it. The agent needs to check if the boulder is on a fountain. The latest language observation says the fountain is near southsoutheast, and the boulder is near eastsoutheast. If the boulder is not yet on a fountain, the agent needs to push it there.

Given the obstacles, maybe the best move is to move east to (36,12) and attempt to push the boulder southeast or south. Alternatively, check if there's a clear path to the southeast. Since the agent can't pass through bars, they need to find a path around.

Looking at the map, the agent is surrounded by bars to the north, west, and northwest. Moving south might lead to an open area. Let me check the cursor position and map again. The agent is at (35,12). Moving south to (35,13) – what's there? The map shows mostly ##########, which are walls. So probably can't move south.

Alternatively, moving north to (35,11). The map at that position might be open. If the agent moves north, they can check if there's a way to reposition the boulder. But the previous attempts to push north didn't work due to bars.

Hmm, maybe the agent needs to reposition themselves to get a better angle to push the boulder. For example, moving east to (36,12) and then trying to push the boulder south or southeast. But earlier attempts there hit bars. Alternatively, moving northeast to (36,11) if possible.

Wait, the language observation says bars are adjacent to southwest, west, and northwest. So moving northwest from (35,12) would go to (34,11), which is blocked. Moving northeast to (36,11) – is that possible? The agent was at (37,11) before, so maybe (36,11) is a valid position. If the agent moves northeast to (36,11), they might be able to push the boulder from there.

Alternatively, since the boulder is near east and eastsoutheast, perhaps the agent should move east to (36,12) and then try pushing the boulder east again, but that might hit a bar. The message when pushing east previously was ""You cannot pass through the bars.""

Given all this, the most feasible action might be to move east to (36,12) and then try pushing the boulder southeast if possible. Alternatively, check if there's a path to the south where the boulder can be pushed onto the fountain. Since the fountain is in the southsoutheast, perhaps pushing the boulder there requires moving it diagonally, but Boxoban usually allows pushing in four directions, not diagonally.

Another angle: the agent's previous attempt to push west failed because the boulder was blocked. Maybe the boulder is stuck against a wall or another obstacle. To free it, the agent needs to move around it. If the boulder is at (37,12), pushing it west would require being adjacent to it. The agent is at (35,12), so they need to move closer. Moving east to (36,12), then east again to (37,12), and then push west. But earlier attempts to push east were blocked by bars.

Wait, in the current observation, the agent is at (35,12). The boulder is near east and eastsoutheast. So the boulder is probably at (36,12) or (37,12). If the agent moves east to (36,12), they can try to push the boulder from there. But pushing east from (36,12) might be blocked by bars. Alternatively, pushing south or southeast from (36,12).

Given that the agent needs to get the boulder to the fountain in the southsoutheast, perhaps pushing it south from (36,12) towards (36,13), but the map shows that area as bars. So that's not possible. Maybe push southeast to (37,13), but again, bars are likely there.

Alternatively, the agent could move south to (35,13) and then try pushing the boulder east or southeast. But the map indicates that area is blocked by bars.

This is tricky. The agent might be stuck because the boulder is adjacent to a wall, making it impossible to push in any direction. In such cases, the agent needs to find a way to move around the boulder by moving themselves to a different position. For example, moving north to (35,11) and then trying to push the boulder east or southeast.

Looking at the current map, the agent is at (35,12). Moving north to (35,11), what's there? The map shows #`@.###### at y=4, but the agent's current y is 12. The map's exact layout is a bit unclear, but based on the coordinates, moving north from (35,12) would be to (35,11), which might be a passable area if there are no bars. The language observation mentions bars near northnortheast, etc., but not specifically at (35,11).

If the agent moves north to (35,11), they might be able to reposition and then push the boulder. Alternatively, move southwest to (34,12), but that's adjacent to bars.

Another possibility: since the boulder is at (37,12) and the agent is at (35,12), maybe the agent needs to go around the boulder to the east or west. But the east side is blocked by bars, and the west side is where the agent is. So perhaps the only way is to push the boulder north, but that might not lead anywhere useful.

Wait, the stairs up are far eastsoutheast. Maybe the goal is to get the boulder to the stairs, but the problem states the goal is to push boulders onto fountains. So the priority is the fountain.

Given all these considerations, the best action might be to move east to (36,12) and then attempt to push the boulder south or southeast, even if it's blocked. Alternatively, move north to find a clearer path.

But given the previous failures and the obstacles, perhaps the agent should try moving east to (36,12) and then push the boulder south. Let's see: from (36,12), pushing south would take the boulder to (36,13). If that's a valid move (not a bar), then it could work. Otherwise, the agent needs to try another direction.

Alternatively, since the agent is at (35,12) and the boulder is near east, maybe moving east to (36,12) and then pushing the boulder east to (37,12), but that's likely blocked by bars.

In conclusion, after several attempts to push the boulder west and east, which were blocked, the agent should try moving east to get closer and push in a different direction, such as south or southeast, towards the fountain. If that's not possible, the agent might need to reposition to a different quadrant of the map to find a valid path.

Let's try to figure out the best move here. The agent is trying to push boulders into fountains in Boxoban. The goal is to navigate and push the boulders to their target positions.

Looking at the current observation, the agent is at position (35,12). There's a boulder adjacent to the north, which they tried to push west before but couldn't because of bars blocking the way. The bars are in various directions, making movement tricky. The fountains are located to the southeast and southwest, so that's where the boulders need to go.

The previous attempts to push the boulder west didn't work because of the bars. Maybe the agent needs to position themselves differently. If the boulder is north of the agent, perhaps moving south temporarily could allow pushing it in another direction. Alternatively, checking if there's an open path around the bars to the south or east might help.

Another angle: since the agent can't push west past the bars, maybe moving east could open up a path. But east is also blocked by bars. What about moving south to get around the barrier? If the agent goes south, they might find a way to position the boulder towards the southeast fountain.

Also, the agent's inventory has a katana and yumi (bow), but pushing boulders probably doesn't require attacking. The main goal is physical movement. So focusing on movement actions that lead to pushing the boulder towards a fountain without hitting obstacles.

Looking at the map layout, the agent is in a corridor with bars on the north and some directions. The boulder is north of the agent. To push it south into the fountain southsoutheast, the agent needs to be adjacent to the boulder and push in the correct direction. But the bars are blocking the direct path. Maybe moving southwest first to get around the bars and then push the boulder southeast.

Wait, the boulder is adjacent north. So the agent is south of the boulder. To push the boulder south, the agent needs to be south of it. But the agent is already south. Wait, if the agent is at (35,12), and the boulder is adjacent north, that would mean the boulder is at (35,11). But the agent's current position is (35,12). So to push the boulder south, the agent needs to be south of it, but they already are. However, the bars are in the way to the south. Maybe the agent needs to move the boulder in another direction first.

Alternatively, maybe the boulder can be pushed west, but earlier attempts failed because of bars. The agent tried pushing west and got a message that they can't pass through bars. So the path west is blocked by bars, preventing movement. Therefore, pushing west isn't an option here.

Perhaps the agent needs to move east to create space. But east is also blocked by bars. The only open directions might be south or southwest. Moving south could allow the agent to get around the bars and then reposition to push the boulder towards the southeast fountain.

So the plan is: move south to (35,13), then check if the path is clear. From there, maybe move east or west to find a way to push the boulder. Alternatively, move southwest to (34,12) and try pushing the boulder southeast from there.

Another thing to note is the fountain locations. The southeast fountain is a target, so pushing the boulder there would be ideal. The agent needs to align the boulder's position with the fountain. Since the boulder is currently north of the agent, pushing it south towards the southeast fountain might work if there's a clear path.

Wait, the agent is at (35,12), and the fountain is southsoutheast. If the boulder is moved south to (35,11), then moving it further south or southeast could reach the fountain. But the bars in the north direction might be preventing that. The agent needs to navigate around the bars to find an open path.

Maybe the best move is to move south to (35,13) and see if there's a way to push the boulder from there. Alternatively, move east to (36,12) if possible, but east is blocked by bars. So south seems like the only viable option.

So, the next action should be to move south to (35,13) and then try pushing the boulder in the desired direction once there.

Let's try to figure out what to do here. The goal is to push boulders onto fountains in Boxoban. The current observation shows the agent's position at (35, 13). The map has a lot of bars and dark areas, which might be walls or obstacles. The boulders are near eastnortheast and eastsoutheast. There are fountains near east, eastsoutheast, and southsoutheast, which are probably targets.

Looking at the message, the boulder is very near north. Wait, but the cursor is at (35,13). Maybe the boulder is to the north of here? Let me check the adjacent areas. The language observation mentions a boulder adjacent south. Oh, so the boulder is south of the agent's current position. The agent is trying to push it, but previous attempts didn't work because maybe there's something blocking the way or the boulder is already in a position where it can't be pushed further.

The agent just moved south to (35,13). The fountains are to the east and southeast. The boulder is adjacent south, so it's probably right below the agent. If the agent moves south again, they might be pushing the boulder towards the fountain. But wait, the message says ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" when trying to push west or southeast. Maybe the boulder is stuck against another obstacle or a wall.

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to position themselves correctly. Since the boulder is adjacent south, if the agent moves south, they could push it. Let's see: the agent is at (35,13). Moving south to (35,14) would allow them to push the boulder south towards the fountain at (35,15) perhaps. But the map shows bars very near southeast, southsouthwest, and northnorthwest. So, there might be walls to the southeast, making it impossible to push the boulder that way.

Looking at the stairs up near eastsoutheast, but that's probably irrelevant for this level. The key is to get the boulder to the fountain. The fountain is very near east, eastsoutheast, and southsoutheast. If the boulder can be pushed east or southeast, that would solve the problem. But the agent is currently at (35,13). The boulder is south, so moving south to (35,14) and then trying to push it east or southeast might work.

Wait, the agent just tried pushing west and south before, but the boulder couldn't be moved. Maybe the direction needs to be adjusted. If the agent moves east first, then tries to push the boulder south towards the fountain. Alternatively, check if there's a clear path to the fountain from the boulder's current position.

Another possibility is that the boulder is blocked by another obstacle. The bars and dark areas might be walls that the boulder can't pass through. The agent needs to find a way to maneuver the boulder around those obstacles. For example, if the boulder is against a wall, the agent might need to move it in a different direction to free it up.

In the last observation, after moving south to (35,13), the boulder is adjacent south. So the agent is north of the boulder. To push the boulder south, the agent needs to move south into the boulder's space. But if there's a wall or another obstacle south of the boulder, that won't work. The agent should check the map for obstacles in the direction they want to push.

Looking at the map, there's a lot of ""##########"" which likely represent walls or unpassable terrain. The exact layout isn't clear, but the agent's position is near some bars and dark areas. The key is to determine if pushing the boulder in a certain direction is possible without hitting a wall.

Given that the fountains are to the east and southeast, maybe pushing the boulder east first, then south. But the agent is at (35,13). If they move east to (36,13), then try to push the boulder south-east. However, the boulder is currently south of the agent, so moving east might not help. Alternatively, the agent should position themselves to the north of the boulder to push it south towards the fountain.

Wait, the boulder is adjacent south, so the agent is north of it. To push it south, the agent needs to move south into the boulder's space. If that's possible (i.e., there's no wall there), then the push should work. The previous attempts to push west or southeast failed because those directions might be blocked.

So the correct action would be to move south into the boulder's space, effectively pushing it south. If that's possible, the boulder would then move to (35,14), and the agent would be at (35,14). Then, check if from there, the boulder can be pushed further towards the fountain.

Therefore, the next action should be to push south. But the agent needs to confirm if the space south of the boulder is clear. Looking at the language observation, it mentions bars very near southeast, southsouthwest, and northnorthwest. The bars are in those directions, but the exact position relative to the boulder isn't clear. If moving the boulder south doesn't lead into a bar, then it's feasible.

Given the information, the best action is to attempt to push the boulder south again, even though previous attempts in that direction failed. Maybe there was a misinterpretation of the map. Alternatively, the agent might need to try a different direction after adjusting their position.

Another angle: perhaps the agent needs to move east first to create space for the boulder. If the agent moves east to (36,13), then they can push the boulder south-east towards the fountain. But the boulder is currently south, so moving east might not help. Alternatively, moving south to be adjacent to the boulder and then pushing east.

In conclusion, the most logical next step is to try pushing the boulder south again, as that's the direction towards the fountains, and the agent is positioned north of the boulder. If that doesn't work, the agent might need to reposition.

Let's see what's going on here. The agent is in a Boxoban-like environment, trying to push boulders onto fountains. The previous actions tried pushing in various directions but got errors because of bars or couldn't move. The current position is (35, 12) with a boulder adjacent to the north. The message says ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain,"" which probably means there's something blocking it, like another boulder or a barrier.

Looking at the map, the agent is near several bars and dark areas, which are obstacles. The nearest boulder is to the north. The agent needs to push that boulder, but maybe it's stuck because there's no space behind it. The fountains are in the southsoutheast and westsouthwest areas. The stairs up are eastsoutheast, but the goal is to push the boulders onto fountains first.

The latest observation after moving south shows the agent at (35,13). The language observations mention a fountain very near east, eastsoutheast, and southsoutheast. So maybe moving southeast could get closer to a fountain. But the last action was pushing south, which might have moved the agent down but not towards a fountain.

The inventory has a katana and yumi (bow), but pushing boulders requires physical movement. The agent should try to navigate around the bars and find a path to the boulder. Since the boulder is adjacent north at (35,11), perhaps moving north to be next to it again and then pushing in a direction towards a fountain. Wait, but the previous attempts to push west or south didn't work because of bars.

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to go east to find a way around the bars. The stairs are eastsoutheast, but the fountains are south and southsoutheast. So moving southeast might lead towards the fountains. However, there's a dark area there, which could be a wall or another obstacle.

Another angle: the agent is at (35,12). The boulder is north at (35,11). If the agent moves north again, they can try pushing the boulder west or east. But the bars are to the eastnortheast and eastsoutheast, so pushing east might hit a bar. Pushing west could lead towards the westsouthwest fountain if there's a path.

Alternatively, the agent could move west to (34,12) and see if there's a way to push the boulder west from there. But the current language observation says the boulder is adjacent northwest, so maybe it's to the northwest of the agent's current position. Wait, the boulder adjacent west at (35,12) — no, the observation says ""boulder adjacent west,"" so the boulder is to the west of the agent. So the agent is at (35,12), and the boulder is at (34,12). To push the boulder west, the agent needs to be next to it and push in the west direction, but there's a bar adjacent west, which would block the pushed boulder.

So perhaps the agent needs to move west to get next to the boulder and then push it north or south. But moving west from (35,12) to (34,12) would place the agent next to the boulder. Then pushing west from there would try to move the boulder to (33,12), but if there's a bar at (33,12), it won't work. The bars are very near north, northnortheast, northeast, southsouthwest, and northnorthwest, so maybe (33,12) is clear.

Alternatively, after moving west to (34,12), push the boulder south to (34,13), which might be towards a fountain. The fountain is very near southsoutheast, so moving the boulder towards there could work.

But the agent needs to check the map layout. The map shows a lot of ########## which are walls or barriers. The agent's current position is near some walls, so movement is restricted. The best bet is to navigate around the bars to reach the boulder and push it towards a fountain.

Given the previous errors when pushing west or south due to bars, the agent should try to move west to get next to the boulder and then push it in a direction where there's no obstacle. Let's try that.

Let's see. I need to help the agent push the boulder into the fountain in Boxoban. The current position is (x=35, y=12). The boulder is adjacent to the west, so moving west might allow pushing it. But the bars are all around, so I need to check the map again.

Looking at the map, there are a lot of bars blocking paths. The boulder is near southsoutheast and southsouthwest. The agent tried pushing west before but the boulder didn't move. Maybe the direction isn't right. The fountain is near south, so maybe push the boulder south?

Wait, the previous attempts to push west resulted in ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" Maybe the agent is next to the boulder but not in the correct direction. Let me check the cursor position and the boulder's location.

From the language observation, the boulder is adjacent west. So the boulder is to the west of the agent. To push it, the agent needs to be behind the boulder. Wait, no. In Sokoban-like games, you push by moving into the boulder, which then moves in the direction you're pushing. So if the boulder is adjacent west, the agent needs to be west of it to push east, or east of it to push west. But the agent is at (35,12), and the boulder is adjacent west. That means the boulder is at (34,12). So to push it west, the agent needs to be at (34,12) and move west, but that's blocked by bars. Alternatively, maybe the agent should push the boulder south into the fountain.

Looking at the fountain locations: fountain near south and southsouthwest. So the target is south. The boulder is at southsoutheast and southsouthwest. If the agent can push the boulder south, it would reach the fountain. How to do that?

The agent is at (35,12). To push the boulder south, the agent needs to be south of it. The boulder is at (34,12), so the agent would need to move east to (34,12) and then push south. But there's a bar adjacent west (the boulder's position), and bars near east. Maybe the path is blocked.

Alternatively, maybe the agent can move south to (35,13) and then push the boulder south from there. Let me check the map. The cursor's map shows #`..###### etc., but it's hard to parse. The important thing is that bars are blocking certain directions.

The previous attempts to push west didn't work, so maybe trying a different direction. The boulder is adjacent west, so pushing it west would require being east of it. But the agent is already east of the boulder (since the boulder is at west). Wait, the agent is at (35,12), and the boulder is at (34,12) (west). So to push the boulder west, the agent needs to move into (34,12) and push west, but that's blocked by bars. Therefore, pushing west is impossible. So the only option is to push the boulder south or east.

Looking at the fountain south, perhaps pushing the boulder south into the fountain. To do that, the agent needs to be south of the boulder. The boulder is at (34,12), so the agent needs to move to (34,13) and then push south. But is that path clear? The agent is currently at (35,12). Moving west to (34,12) is blocked by the boulder. So move south to (35,13), then west to (34,13), then push south. But need to check if there are obstacles.

Alternatively, maybe the agent can push the boulder east first. If the agent moves east to (36,12), then pushes the boulder east. But east is adjacent to bars, so that might not work. The bars are near east, so pushing the boulder east would hit the bars. Therefore, that's not possible.

So the only viable direction is south. Let's try that. The agent needs to get south of the boulder. From (35,12), move south to (35,13), then west to (34,13), then push south. But need to check if there's a path. The map shows some dark areas and bars, but maybe the path is clear.

Alternatively, the agent can try pushing the boulder south directly from (35,12). Since the boulder is at (34,12), pushing it south would move it to (34,13). If there's no obstacle there, it could work. The agent is at (35,12), so to push the boulder south, the agent needs to move south into the boulder's position. Wait, no. In Sokoban, you move into the boulder to push it. So the agent would need to be north of the boulder and move south into it, pushing it south. But the boulder is at (34,12), and the agent is at (35,12). So the agent is east of the boulder. To push it south, the agent needs to move into the boulder from the north, which isn't possible here. Therefore, the agent needs to be south of the boulder to push it north, but that's not the goal. Alternatively, west of the boulder to push east, but that's blocked.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:

- To push a boulder, the agent must move into the boulder's tile, which then moves in the direction the agent is moving.

So if the agent is at (35,12) and the boulder is at (34,12) (west), the agent can push the boulder west by moving west into it. But that's blocked by bars. To push the boulder south, the agent needs to be north of the boulder and move south into it. But the agent is east of the boulder, so that's not possible. Therefore, the only way is to move the agent to be south of the boulder to push it north, which isn't useful, or find another way.

Alternatively, maybe the agent can move east to (36,12), then push the boulder east. But east is adjacent to bars, so that's blocked. Hence, no.

So the only possible direction is to push the boulder south by moving the agent to the south of the boulder. To do that, the agent needs to move west to (34,12) (which is the boulder's position) and then push south. But (34,12) is occupied by the boulder, so the agent can't move there. Therefore, the agent must find a path around.

Alternatively, the agent can move south to (35,13), then west to (34,13), then push south. Let's check if that's possible.

From (35,12), move south to (35,13) – is that allowed? The map shows some obstacles, but the dark area is near south. Assuming the path is clear, then move west to (34,13). If there's no barrier, then push the boulder south from (34,13) into (34,14). If that tile is a fountain, then success.

But based on the language observation, the fountain is near south and southsouthwest. The boulder is at southsoutheast, so pushing it further south into the southsouthwest fountain would be ideal.

Given the barriers, the most feasible path is to push the boulder south into the fountain. So the steps would be:

1. Move south from (35,12) to (35,13).
2. Move west from (35,13) to (34,13).
3. Push the boulder south from (34,13) to (34,14), which should be a fountain.

But need to confirm if those moves are possible. The previous attempts to push west failed, perhaps because the agent wasn't positioned correctly. Let's try this approach.

Let's see. I need to get the boulders to the fountains in Boxoban. The player is at (35,13). The map has a lot of bars and dark areas, which I assume are obstacles. There's a boulder very near north and a fountain adjacent north. The message says ""dark area very near southwest, west, and northwest,"" so those directions might be blocked.

Earlier actions tried pushing west and south, but collisions with bars occurred. The latest valid action was moving south to (35,13). Now, the cursor is here. The boulder is north, and the fountain is north. If I can push the boulder north towards the fountain, that would solve the problem. But how?

Looking at the map, the agent is facing south at (35,13). To push the boulder north, the agent needs to be adjacent to it. The boulder is very near north, so maybe it's at (35,12). The agent is at (35,13), so moving north to (35,12) would put them next to the boulder. Then, pushing north from there would move the boulder to (35,11), towards the fountain adjacent north.

But wait, the last message after moving south said there's a fountain adjacent north. So pushing the boulder north from (35,12) into (35,11) would put it on the fountain. That's the goal. So the steps should be: move north to get next to the boulder, then push north.

But the previous attempts to push west or other directions failed because of bars. So the correct action now is to move north towards the boulder, then push north. Since the agent is already at (35,13), moving north once would get them to (35,12), adjacent to the boulder. Then push north.

But in the current observation, after moving south to (35,13), the boulder is very near north, which would be at (35,12). So the valid actions here would be north to approach the boulder, then push north. However, the agent needs to be adjacent to the boulder to push it. Let's confirm:

- Agent is at (35,13)
- Boulder is very near north, so likely at (35,12)
- So moving north once to (35,12) would be adjacent
- Then push north to (35,11), which is toward the fountain adjacent north (which is at (35,11) perhaps?)

Therefore, the correct sequence is north then push north. But the user is asking for the next action based on the current observation. The current position is (35,13), and the boulder is north. So the first step is to move north to get adjacent. So the next action should be north, then push north. But since the agent can only take one action per turn, the immediate action is to move north to position (35,12) to be able to push the boulder.

Wait, but in the last observation, after moving south to (35,13), the message was empty, so no obstacles there. The bars are far away. So moving north should be possible. Then, once adjacent, push north. But the user's current observation is at (35,13), and the boulder is very near north. So the correct action now is to move north to get next to the boulder. Once there, the next action would be to push north. But since we can only output one action, the immediate action is north.

94,push south,"<reasoning>
Let's see where I am right now. The agent is at position (35, 12). The goal is to push the boulders onto the fountains. Looking at the map, there are bars and dark areas surrounding the play area. The boulders are near the southsoutheast and southsouthwest, and there's a fountain there too. The agent tried pushing the boulder west before but couldn't because of bars blocking the way. The latest observation shows that after pushing west, the boulder is now adjacent to the west. The message says ""You cannot pass through the bars,"" so the bars must be blocking the path.

The agent is facing a situation where the boulder is next to a bar, preventing further movement. The next logical step is to try pushing the boulder in a different direction where there's no obstacle. Since the bars are adjacent to the northwest, southwest, and west, pushing the boulder south might be possible if there's space. Alternatively, moving the agent to a position where they can push the boulder away from the bars.

Looking at the last move, the agent went south to (35, 13), but then went back north. The boulder is adjacent west at (35,12). Maybe the agent needs to move east to get a better angle to push the boulder south or southeast. Alternatively, pushing the boulder south towards the fountain. The fountain is at southsoutheast, so pushing the boulder towards there could be the solution. However, the bars are in the way, so the agent needs to navigate around them.

Another possibility is that the agent should move west to get next to the boulder and try pushing it again, but the previous attempts resulted in failure due to bars. Maybe moving east to create space. Alternatively, the agent could try pushing the boulder in a direction that's not blocked by bars. Since the bars are to the northwest, southwest, and west, pushing the boulder east or south might be feasible.

Wait, the agent is currently at (35,12). The boulder is adjacent west. So the boulder is at (34,12). To push it west, it would go to (33,12), but there's a bar adjacent west. So that's blocked. Maybe pushing the boulder south to (34,13). Is there a path there? The map shows some structure with `##########` which might be walls or obstacles. The agent needs to check if moving south from the boulder's position is possible.

Alternatively, the agent could move east to (36,12) and then try pushing the boulder west from there. But the agent's current position is (35,12), so moving east would be (36,12). If the boulder is at (34,12), pushing it west from (36,12) isn't possible. Maybe the agent needs to reposition to a spot where they can push the boulder in a valid direction.

Looking at the language observation, there's a fountain very near eastsoutheast and southeast. The boulder is very near south. So perhaps the target fountain is to the southeast. The agent should direct the boulder towards there. To do that, the agent might need to move the boulder south or southeast.

But given the bars blocking the west and northwest, the agent's options are limited. Maybe moving south to (35,13) and then pushing the boulder east or southeast. Alternatively, the agent could try pushing the boulder south from its current position (34,12) to (34,13). Is that path clear?

The map shows some symbols like `#` which are probably walls or obstacles. The agent's position is near `#` symbols, indicating that moving into those would be impossible. The `...<##` in the map might be part of the structure. The agent needs to navigate around these to find a valid path to push the boulder.

Given the previous attempts to push west resulted in failure due to bars, the next best option might be to push the boulder south. The agent could move to the position south of the boulder and push it further south towards the fountain. So the agent should move east to get next to the boulder and then push it south.

Alternatively, the agent could try pushing the boulder east towards the eastsoutheast where the fountain is. But there's a bar near eastnortheast, so that might not be possible. 

Considering all this, the best action is to move east to (36,12) and then push the boulder west towards the fountain, avoiding the bars. Alternatively, if moving east isn't possible, the agent might need to push the boulder south. However, the exact path needs to be clear. Since the agent's last move was south to (35,13), maybe moving back north and then east would be better.

But the current position after the last move is (35,12). The boulder is at (34,12). To push it south, the agent needs to be adjacent to the boulder. So moving east to (36,12) and then pushing south might work. Wait, no, the boulder is at (34,12). To push it south, the agent would need to be at (34,12) and push south to (34,13). But the agent is at (35,12). So maybe moving west to (34,12) and then pushing south. But the agent tried pushing west before and it didn't work because of bars. 

Alternatively, the agent could move south to (35,13) and then try pushing the boulder east or south. From (35,13), if the boulder is at (34,12), the agent would need to move west to (34,13) and then push south. But the path might be blocked by bars or walls.

This is getting complicated. The key is to find a direction where the boulder can be pushed without hitting bars. Given the current observations, the only clear direction might be south. The agent should move into a position where they can push the boulder south towards the fountain. So the next action could be to move south to (35,13) and then push the boulder south to (34,13). But need to check if that's possible.

Alternatively, the agent could move west to (34,12) and try pushing the boulder south again, even though there's a bar adjacent west. But the message says ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" So pushing west is blocked. Therefore, south might be the only option. 

So the agent should move south to (35,13) and then push the boulder south to (34,13). Let's check if there are any obstacles there. The map shows `#` symbols around, but the exact path isn't clear. However, the language observation mentions bars very near southsouthwest, so maybe moving south is feasible.

Therefore, the chosen action is to push south.

",-0.001,False
95,push south,"<reasoning>
The agent is trying to solve Boxoban by pushing boulders onto fountains. The current state shows the player's position at (35, 12). The map has a lot of bars (obstacles) and a boulder adjacent to the west. The previous attempts to push the boulder west kept failing, probably because there's another obstacle or the boulder is blocked.

Looking at the observations, the boulder is adjacent to the west, so maybe the agent is next to it. The message says ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain,"" which suggests that the boulder can't be pushed in the intended direction. Perhaps the boulder is stuck against another obstacle or a wall.

The agent needs to find a different direction to push the boulder. Since pushing west didn't work, maybe trying another direction like south or east? But looking at the map, moving east might hit the bars nearby. South could be an option if there's space. The fountains are near the south, so pushing the boulder towards there would be the goal.

Wait, the previous actions included moving south and then north. The boulder was at southsoutheast and southsouthwest. Maybe the agent needs to reposition themselves to push the boulder in a different direction. Perhaps moving west again but there's a bar adjacent to the northwest, so that's blocked. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to move around the bars to get a better position to push the boulder. For example, moving north to a different spot and then attempting to push the boulder in another direction. But the agent's current position is (35,12), and moving north didn't change the boulder's position.

Another thought: the boulder might be stuck against a bar. If the agent can move around to the side where there's no obstacle, they could push it. Since pushing west didn't work, maybe pushing east if there's space. But the east direction has bars near eastnortheast and eastsoutheast, so that's likely blocked.

The agent could try pushing the boulder south towards the fountain. The map shows a fountain near south and southsouthwest. If the boulder is moved south, it could reach the fountain. But the current message says pushing the boulder in vain, so maybe the path isn't clear. The agent needs to check if there's a clear path to the south.

Looking at the language observation, the boulder is adjacent west, and the bars are adjacent southwest, west, and northwest. So to push the boulder south, the agent would need to be positioned such that the boulder's path isn't blocked by bars. Maybe the agent needs to move the boulder west first, but that's blocked. Alternatively, find a way to move around the bars to push the boulder in another direction.

Alternatively, the agent might need to move to a different position where they can push the boulder without obstruction. For example, moving east to a spot where the boulder isn't blocked. But the east direction has bars, so that's not possible.

Wait, the inventory shows the agent has a katana, yumi, and ya arrows. Maybe using ranged attacks to remove obstacles, but in Boxoban, the standard actions are movement and pushing. So probably not applicable here.

The key is to find a valid direction to push the boulder. Since west and south attempts failed, maybe trying east or north. But bars are in those directions. Alternatively, perhaps the agent needs to move the boulder in a different sequence. For example, push it west once, then reposition, but the agent is stuck because the boulder can't be moved.

Another idea: check if the boulder is at the edge of the map. The map has a lot of ##########, which are probably walls or bars. If the boulder is against a wall, it can't be pushed further. The agent needs to check the map layout. From the map snippets, it looks like the agent is in a corridor with bars around. The boulder might be at a dead end.

In Boxoban, the solution often involves navigating around obstacles to position the boulder on the target. Since the agent is stuck pushing the boulder west and it's not working, maybe they need to move to a different part of the map to find a way to push it towards the fountain. For example, moving north to a different corridor where the boulder can be pushed south into the fountain.

Looking at the cursor position (35,12), moving north to (35,11) might reveal a different part of the map. If there's a clear path there, the agent could reposition. But previous north movements didn't change the boulder's position. Alternatively, moving south to (35,13) where there's a fountain nearby. But the boulder is currently at southsoutheast, so maybe moving it further south.

Wait, the message when pushing west says ""You cannot pass through the bars,"" but the latest attempt to push south also resulted in failure. Maybe the boulder is between two bars or walls. The agent needs to check the map's structure. The map has a lot of '#' which are walls or bars. The boulder's position is adjacent west, so at (34,12). If there's a bar at (34,12), the boulder can't be pushed further west.

In that case, the agent needs to find another way to move the boulder. Perhaps pushing it south into the fountain. If the path south is clear, that would be the solution. But the agent's previous attempt to push south failed, which might be because the boulder is blocked by another obstacle or the path is blocked by bars.

The language observation mentions ""bars very near north, northnortheast, northeast, southsouthwest, and northnorthwest."" This suggests that the area south of the boulder is blocked by bars, making it impossible to push the boulder further south. Therefore, the agent needs to find a different strategy.

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to push the boulder east, but there are bars in that direction. The observation says bars are near eastnortheast and east, so pushing east would hit a bar. 

At this point, it's possible that the agent is in a loop trying to push the boulder west, which is blocked, leading to defaulting to north. The correct action would be to find a valid direction where the boulder can be pushed. Since all previous attempts haven't worked, perhaps the agent needs to move to a different location on the map to create a path for the boulder.

Looking at the map, the agent is in a corridor with bars on multiple sides. The only clear directions might be north or south, but those might be blocked. Alternatively, moving west again but avoiding the bars. Wait, the boulder is adjacent west, so the agent is next to it. If the agent moves west, they would be at (34,12), but there's a bar adjacent northwest, so moving west isn't possible. Hence, the agent can't push the boulder west because there's a bar behind it.

This suggests that the boulder is trapped between the agent and a bar. The only way to push it is to move the agent in a direction that allows the boulder to be pushed without hitting the bar. For example, if the agent moves south, then pushes the boulder south-west around the bar. But the agent's previous attempt to push south didn't work, indicating the path might still be blocked.

Given the current observations and the lack of progress, the agent should try a different approach. Maybe moving to a different part of the map to find a way to reposition the boulder. For instance, moving north to (35,11) and then attempting to push the boulder in another direction. However, based on previous experiences, moving north didn't change the situation.

Another possibility is that the boulder is already on a fountain, but the observation doesn't mention it. The agent needs to check if the boulder is on a target. The language observation says ""fountain near southsoutheast and south,"" so if the boulder is moved there, the level is completed. But the current boulder position is southsoutheast and southsouthwest, which are near fountains, but not exactly on them.

Wait, the boulder is very near eastsoutheast, and the fountain is very near eastsoutheast and southeast. So maybe pushing the boulder east into the fountain. But the bars near eastnortheast and east would block that. 

Given all this, the most plausible valid action the agent can take is to attempt pushing the boulder in a direction that isn't blocked by bars. Since west and south haven't worked, maybe trying east or another direction. However, based on the map and obstacles, the only possible valid action might be to move in a different direction like north or try pushing again in a different direction after repositioning.

But since the agent is repeatedly trying to push west and failing, perhaps the correct action is to move around to the side where the boulder can be pushed. For example, moving north to a spot where the boulder can be pushed south-west around the bars. Alternatively, moving east to see if there's a clear path.

After careful consideration, the best action the agent can take in the current state is to attempt pushing the boulder south again, as the fountain is in that direction, and maybe there's a clear path now. However, previous attempts didn't work, so perhaps the agent needs to move to a different position first. But given the current position and the lack of other clear options, pushing south might be the next logical step, even if it fails again, or perhaps there's an unexpected path clear now.

I need to figure out how to push the boulder onto the fountain in this Boxoban-like game. Let's start by understanding the current situation based on the observations.

From the previous messages and the map, the agent is at position (35, 12). The boulders are adjacent to the west and eastsoutheast, but there are bars blocking certain directions. The goal is to push the boulder onto the fountain, which is near southsoutheast. 

Looking at the map, the cursor's position is (35, 12), which is the agent's location. The boulder is adjacent to the west (since previous actions tried pushing west, but it failed). Wait, in the latest observation, the boulder is adjacent west. But when the agent tried pushing west before, it said ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" Maybe there's another obstacle behind the boulder that's not mentioned. 

The language observation mentions a boulder very near southsoutheast and southsouthwest. Also, the bars are adjacent southwest, west, and northwest. The agent's current position is (35,12), and the fountain is near southsoutheast. So the path to the fountain might be blocked by bars. 

Wait, the map shows some structures but they're all ##########, which might represent walls or bars. The agent needs to navigate around these to reach the boulder. Let's think about possible moves.

The agent tried pushing west multiple times but failed. Maybe the boulder is stuck against another obstacle. Alternatively, the agent might need to move in a different direction to get around the bars and position the boulder correctly.

Another observation says there's a boulder very near eastsoutheast. Maybe pushing that one towards the fountain? But the agent is at (35,12), and pushing eastsoutheast would require moving east first. However, there are bars far eastnortheast and east, which might block that path.

Alternatively, the agent could move south to get closer to the fountain. But in the last move, moving south was attempted, and the agent's position is now (35,13). The map's structure there might have more bars. 

Wait, the message after pushing west said ""You cannot pass through the bars."" So the boulder is against a bar. To push the boulder, there must be nothing behind it. But if there's a bar behind the boulder, the agent can't push it further in that direction.

Looking at the language observation, the boulder is adjacent west. So the boulder is to the west of the agent's current position. To push it west, the agent would need to be next to it and push in that direction. If the agent is at (35,12), the boulder would be at (34,12). If there's a bar at (33,12), then pushing the boulder west would be impossible because it's blocked by the bar.

In that case, the agent needs to move around the boulder to a different side to push it in a direction where there's no obstacle. Maybe moving south or north to get around the boulder and then push it east or south towards the fountain.

But the agent's current position is (35,12). If the boulder is at (34,12), then moving west to (34,12) and then trying to push west again wouldn't work because of the bar at (33,12). Alternatively, maybe the agent can push the boulder south or north if possible.

Looking at the language observation again, the boulder very near eastsoutheast. Wait, that's another boulder. So there are two boulders: one adjacent west (at (34,12)) and another very near eastsoutheast (maybe around (36,13) or similar). The fountain is near southsoutheast, which could be (37,14) perhaps.

The agent's goal is to push one of the boulders onto the fountain. Let's focus on the boulder at (34,12). To push it south towards the fountain, the agent would need to move to (34,12) and push south. But the agent is at (35,12). So first, move west to (34,12), then push south. But the bars near north, northnortheast, etc., might block that path.

Alternatively, maybe the boulder at (34,12) can be pushed east. But there are bars east of that position. The bars near eastnortheast and east suggest that moving east from (34,12) would hit a bar.

Hmm. The other boulder is very near eastsoutheast. If the agent can push that one towards the fountain, that might work. Let's say the boulder is at (36,13). The fountain is near southsoutheast, which could be (37,14). So pushing the boulder from (36,13) to (37,14) would place it on the fountain. But to do that, the agent needs to move to (36,13) and push east. However, there are bars east of that position, so that might not be possible.

Alternatively, maybe the fountain is at (35,14), southsoutheast from (35,12). If the agent can push the boulder at (34,12) south to (34,13), then (34,14), and then (34,15), but there might be bars or other obstacles blocking that path.

Looking at the map, it's a grid of ##########, which are probably walls or bars. The agent needs to find a path around these to reach the boulder and push it towards the fountain.

Another approach: The agent has a katana and yumi (bow), but pushing boulders is the main goal. The inventory doesn't seem to have anything else relevant.

Given the previous failed attempts to push west, maybe the agent should try moving south to get a different angle. From (35,12) moving south to (35,13), then west to (34,13), and see if the boulder at (34,12) can be pushed south from there.

But the bars near southsoutheast and south might block that. Alternatively, moving north from (35,12) to (35,11), then west to (34,11), and try pushing the boulder south.

However, the bars adjacent north, northeast, and northwest could be in the way. The agent's current position is at (35,12). The bars very near north, northnortheast, northeast, etc., so moving north might hit a bar.

Alternatively, the agent could try pushing the other boulder at eastsoutheast. If the agent moves east to (36,12), then southeast to (36,13), and push the boulder there towards the fountain.

But the language observation says there's a boulder very near eastsoutheast, which might be at (36,13). If the agent can get next to that boulder and push it south or southeast towards the fountain.

In the current observation, the boulder is adjacent north. Wait, no, the latest observation says ""boulder adjacent north"" in the language observation. So the boulder is north of the agent's current position (35,12), meaning at (35,11). But that can't be right because the agent is at (35,12). Wait, the language observation says ""boulder adjacent north"", which would be at (35,11). But earlier, the agent tried pushing west and south, so maybe the boulder is in another direction.

This is getting a bit confusing. Let me recheck the latest language observation:

""bars very near north, northnortheast, northeast, southsouthwest, and northnorthwest
boulder very near east, southeast, and southsoutheast
fountain very near southsoutheast
bars adjacent southwest, west, and northwest
fountain adjacent southwest
boulder adjacent west""

So the boulder adjacent west is at (34,12). The boulder very near east, southeast, and southsoutheast could be other boulders. The agent is at (35,12). The fountain is very near southsoutheast, which might be at (37,14) or similar.

The agent needs to push one of the boulders towards the fountain. The boulder at (34,12) is adjacent west. If the agent moves west to (34,12) and tries to push it west again, but there's a bar at (33,12), so that won't work. Therefore, the agent should try pushing the boulder in another direction, like south.

From (34,12), pushing south would take it to (34,13). Is there a path there? The bars near southsoutheast and south might block. Alternatively, if the agent can move to (34,12) and then push south, perhaps around the bars.

Alternatively, the agent could move south to (35,13), then west to (34,13), and try pushing the boulder from there. But again, bars might be in the way.

Another option is to check if there's a way to push the other boulders. The boulder very near eastsoutheast might be at (36,13). If the agent moves east to (36,12), then southeast to (36,13), and push the boulder there towards the fountain. But again, bars might block.

Given the complexity, perhaps the best move is to try pushing the western boulder again, but since that failed before, maybe the agent needs to navigate around it. For example, move south to (35,13), then west to (34,13), and see if pushing the boulder south from there is possible.

Alternatively, since the agent's previous attempts to push west failed because of bars, maybe the agent should try moving north to find a different path. From (35,12), moving north to (35,11), then west to (34,11), and attempt to push the boulder south from there.

But the bars adjacent north, northeast, and northwest suggest that moving north might be blocked. The agent's current position is (35,12), and bars are very near north, so moving north to (35,11) might hit a bar.

This is tricky. The agent needs to carefully navigate around the bars and boulders to position one of them on the fountain. Given the previous attempts and the current position, perhaps the next best action is to move south to (35,13) and then try pushing the boulder from a different angle. Alternatively, move west to (34,12) and check if there's an opening to push the boulder south.

Wait, the boulder at (34,12) is adjacent west. If the agent moves west to (34,12), then tries to push south, the boulder would go to (34,13). If there are no bars at (34,13), that could work. The agent should check the map for obstacles at (34,13).

Looking at the map, it's filled with ##########, which are probably walls or bars. So moving south from (34,12) to (34,13) might be blocked by a bar. Therefore, pushing the boulder south is not possible.

In that case, maybe the agent should try pushing the other boulder. The boulder very near eastsoutheast. Suppose it's at (36,13). The agent can move east to (36,12), then southeast to (36,13), and push the boulder south to (36,14), then towards the fountain at southsoutheast.

But again, bars might be in the way. The language observation mentions bars near southeast and south, so moving southeast might be blocked.

Given the time I've spent and the previous failed attempts, I think the best course of action is to try pushing the western boulder again, even if it failed before, maybe there was a misunderstanding. Or perhaps the agent needs to move in a different direction to create space.

Alternatively, the agent could try moving east to the boulder near eastsoutheast and push it. Let's say the agent moves east to (36,12), then southeast to (36,13), and pushes the boulder there. If successful, it might reach the fountain.

But without knowing the exact map layout, it's hard to say. Given the information, perhaps the next action should be to move east to get closer to the other boulder and attempt to push it towards the fountain.

Let's try to figure out what to do next in this Boxoban game. The goal is to push all the boulders onto the fountains. Looking at the current observation, the agent is at position (36, 12). There's a boulder adjacent to the west, which is at (35,12). The fountains are near southsoutheast and southeast. The bars and dark areas are blocking some paths, so I need to navigate carefully.

The previous actions tried pushing the boulder west multiple times, but it didn't work. Maybe the boulder is against a wall or another obstacle. Let me check the map again. The map shows a lot of ########## which are probably walls or bars. The agent is near a boulder that's very close to the east, southeast, and southsouthwest. The stairs are up near eastsoutheast, so maybe that's a way out, but the goal is to push the boulder to the fountain.

The message says ""You cannot pass through the bars,"" so I need to find a way around them. The agent is at (36,12). To the west is the boulder at (35,12). If I try to push the boulder west again, it might not move if there's something behind it. Let me check the map again. The cursor is on the agent, and to the east there's a `@` which is the agent. The `#` symbols are walls, and `{` might be a fountain or a door. The `<` is probably the goal or the exit.

Since pushing west hasn't worked, maybe I should try moving east to get around the boulder. If I move east once, I can then try pushing the boulder again from a different angle. Alternatively, check if there's a way to move the boulder south or southeast. The fountain is near southsoutheast, so maybe pushing the boulder in that direction would work. But there are bars and dark areas there, so it's blocked.

Wait, the language observation mentions a boulder very near east, southeast, and southsouthwest. So the boulder is at (36,13) maybe? Or perhaps the agent is next to it. If the agent is at (36,12), and the boulder is adjacent west, that would be (35,12). If I move east to (37,12), then maybe I can push the boulder south or southeast. Let me see the map again. The map has a `@` at position (36,11) in the previous steps, but now it's at (36,12). The map shows some `<` symbols which might be the goal.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to move the boulder south into the fountain. If the agent can position themselves to the north of the boulder, they can push it south. The current position is (36,12), and the boulder is at (35,12). So if the agent moves north to (36,11), then tries to push the boulder west, but that might not reach the fountain. The fountain is near southsoutheast, so pushing the boulder towards the southeast direction would be better.

But the bars are blocking the southeast path. The language observation says there are bars near eastnortheast, east, etc. Maybe the only way is to find an open path to the fountain. Alternatively, maybe the boulder is stuck between bars and can't be moved. In that case, the agent needs to find another boulder or navigate to a different position.

Looking at the inventory, the agent has a katana, yumi bow, and other items, but pushing the boulder doesn't require any specific items. The main issue seems to be the boulder's position relative to obstacles. Since pushing west hasn't worked, perhaps trying to move east and then push in a different direction is necessary. Let me try moving east first.

Let's look at the current situation. The agent is at position (37, 12). The goal is to push the boulder onto the fountain. From the map, the boulder is located somewhere, and there's a fountain adjacent to the south and southwest.

The previous actions tried pushing west and south, but it didn't work. Maybe the boulder is blocked by bars or other obstacles. The latest observation shows the boulder adjacent to east, so maybe the agent is too far east and needs to move west to get next to the boulder. 

Looking at the map, the agent is at (37, 12), and the boulder is very near southsoutheast, southwest, and westnorthwest. The cursor is on a cell that might be near the boulder. The message says the boulder is adjacent west, so perhaps moving west would allow the agent to push it towards the fountain.

The fountain is adjacent to the southwest and south. So if the boulder can be pushed south or southwest, it would reach the fountain. The agent needs to position themselves next to the boulder and then push it in the right direction. 

Since the agent just moved east to (37, 12), the boulder might be to the west. So moving west again to get next to the boulder and then push south would be the next step. Alternatively, check if the boulder is south of the current position. 

But according to the language observation, the boulder is very near southsoutheast, southwest, and westnorthwest. The agent's current position is (37,12), so moving south to (37,13) might place them adjacent to the boulder. However, the map shows that moving south from (37,12) could lead to a '#' which is a wall or obstacle. 

Alternatively, moving west to (36,12) where the cursor was before might be better. From there, pushing west could push the boulder closer to the fountain. Since the previous attempts to push west didn't work, maybe the agent wasn't aligned correctly. 

Wait, the latest observation after moving east to (37,12) shows that the boulder is adjacent east. So the boulder is now to the east of the agent. That means the agent needs to move west to get next to the boulder so they can push it east. But the fountain is to the south and southwest. 

Wait, if the boulder is adjacent east, then the agent is at (37,12), and the boulder is at (38,12). To push the boulder, the agent needs to move east into it, but there's bars very near north, northeast, etc., which might block the path. 

Alternatively, the agent needs to move south to get the boulder towards the fountain. But the map might have obstacles there. Let me check the map again. 

The map shows at (37,12) the cell is '@' which is the agent. The cell to the east (38,12) is '{' which could be a boulder or another object. The fountain is adjacent south, so (37,13) might be a fountain. 

The agent's goal is to push the boulder onto the fountain. If the boulder is at (38,12), pushing it south to (38,13) which is a fountain would solve it. But to do that, the agent needs to be south of the boulder. So the agent should move east to be next to the boulder and then push south. 

However, the bars are very near eastnortheast, east, etc., which might be at (39,12) or nearby. So moving east towards the boulder might be blocked by bars. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent should move west to (36,12) and then push west to move the boulder towards the fountain. Wait, but the boulder is adjacent east, so if the agent is at (36,12), the boulder would be at (37,12). Then pushing west from (36,12) would push the boulder to (36,12), which doesn't help. 

Hmm, this is confusing. Let's re-examine the language observations. The boulder is very near southsoutheast, southwest, and westnorthwest. The agent is at (37,12). Southsoutheast from here would be (38,13), which might be a fountain. If the boulder can be pushed to (38,13), that would be the solution. 

To do that, the agent needs to get next to the boulder. Since the boulder is adjacent east, the agent is at (37,12), boulder at (38,12). The agent needs to move east to (38,12) and then push south to (38,13). But the bars very near northeast, east, etc., might be blocking the path. 

Looking at the map, the cell at (38,12) is '{' which could be a boulder. The cell to the east of that (39,12) is part of the ########## wall. So pushing the boulder east from (38,12) would be impossible because of the wall. Therefore, pushing south from (38,12) to (38,13) is the way to go. 

So the agent needs to move east to (38,12) and then push south. But can the agent move east to (38,12)? The cell at (38,12) is '{', which is a boulder. The agent can move into a boulder only if they are pushing it. So to move into (38,12), the agent must push the boulder. But the previous attempt to push west failed because the boulder wasn't there. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent is already next to the boulder. If the boulder is at (38,12), and the agent is at (37,12), then moving east into (38,12) would require pushing the boulder. But the message says ""You try to move the boulder, but in vain."" which implies that the previous push attempts were blocked. 

Wait, in the previous step, the agent tried to push south and west, which didn't work. Now, the agent is at (37,12), and the boulder is adjacent east. So the correct action would be to move east into the boulder's cell, effectively pushing it. But since the bars are nearby, maybe the path is blocked. 

The bars very near eastnortheast (39,13) and east (38,12) might be preventing the boulder from moving further east. Therefore, pushing the boulder south to (38,13) where the fountain is would be the solution. 

So the agent should move east into the boulder's cell (38,12) and then push south. However, the action to push the boulder is ""push [direction]"", not just move. So the correct action would be ""push east"" to push the boulder east, but that's blocked by the wall. Therefore, the next best option is to push south. 

But how to trigger that. The agent needs to be adjacent to the boulder and then issue a push command in the desired direction. Since the agent is at (37,12) and the boulder is at (38,12), pushing east would try to move the boulder to (39,12), which is a bar, so it's blocked. Therefore, the agent should push south, moving the boulder from (38,12) to (38,13), which is a fountain. 

So the correct action is ""push south"".

",-0.001,False

Let's try to figure out what to do next. I'm playing Boxoban, pushing a boulder onto a fountain. The goal is to get the boulder to the fountain. From the observations, the agent is currently at position (37, 11).

Looking at the map, there's a boulder near the southsoutheast and southsouthwest. Also, there's a fountain nearby in the south and southsouthwest. The bars are blocking a lot of the area, so movement might be restricted. The cursor is pointing at the agent's position, which is the samurai.

In previous steps, the agent tried pushing the boulder west multiple times, but it didn't work. Then, they moved south, tried pushing again, but the boulder wasn't moving. Maybe the boulder is against a wall or another obstacle. 

Looking at the latest observation, the boulder is adjacent to the southeast. So, if the agent can move in a direction that allows them to push the boulder away from the bars. Since the bars are blocking north, northeast, east, and northwest, maybe pushing the boulder south or southwest would help. 

The fountain is in the south and southsouthwest. If the boulder is at southsoutheast, maybe pushing it further south towards the fountain. But the agent is at (37,11), and the boulder is at southsoutheast. So moving the agent to the southeast and then pushing the boulder south. 

Wait, the agent's current position is (37,11). The boulder is near southsoutheast and southsouthwest. So maybe the boulder is at (37,12) or (38,11). If the agent is at (37,11) and tries to push south, that would be towards (37,12). If the boulder is there, pushing south would move it to (37,13), but need to check if there's a fountain there. 

Alternatively, if the boulder is at (38,11), pushing southwest might move it towards the fountain. But the bars are adjacent to the agent's current position (north, northeast, east, northwest). So movement north, northeast, east, or northwest is blocked by bars. 

The agent can move south, west, or somewhere else. Since the agent is at (37,11), moving south to (37,12) might be possible if there's no obstacle. Then, if the boulder is at (37,12), pushing south would move it to (37,13). But the fountain is in the south, so maybe that's the way to go. 

Alternatively, check the map again. The map shows some structures with `#` and `@` which might be walls or obstacles. The agent's position is marked with `@`, and the boulder is somewhere nearby. The latest map shows `#`.`@.######` on line 4, which might mean the agent is near a wall to the east. 

So, possible actions: move south to get closer to the boulder, or try to push it in a direction where the path is clear. Since previous pushes didn't work, maybe the boulder is stuck against a bar or another object. The agent needs to position themselves to push the boulder in the right direction. 

Looking at the language observation, the boulder is adjacent to the southeast. That means the boulder is to the southeast of the agent's current position. So the agent is at (37,11), and the boulder is at (38,11) or (37,12). If the boulder is at (38,11), pushing southwest (west and south) might move it towards the fountain. If it's at (37,12), pushing south to (37,13) could get it closer. 

But the agent's inventory doesn't show any tools that would help move boulders, so standard push actions are needed. The agent needs to move next to the boulder and push it. Since the boulder is adjacent southeast, the agent should move southeast (but can't, because the agent's current position is (37,11), and southeast would be (38,12), which might be blocked). 

Alternatively, move south to (37,12), then push south. Let's check the latest observation's map. The map shows line 4 as `#`.@######`, which suggests that at position (37,11), there's a `.` (floor) and the agent's `@`. The next line (5) is `#{..`#####`, so at (37,12), there's a `#` which is a wall. So moving south from (37,11) to (37,12) is blocked by a wall. 

Ah, that's a problem. The agent is at (37,11), and the cell to the south (37,12) is a wall (`#`). So they can't move straight south. Therefore, the agent needs to find another way to get around the wall. Maybe move west to (36,11), then south to (36,12), and then try to push the boulder. 

Looking at the cursor position, the agent is at (37,11). The boulder is adjacent southeast, so likely at (38,11) or (37,12). But (37,12) is a wall. So the boulder must be at (38,11). Then, the agent can move west to (36,11), then east to (37,11), but that's back to the starting position. Alternatively, move west, then south to (36,12), then check if they can push the boulder from there. 

Wait, from (36,11), moving south to (36,12) is possible if that's not a wall. Looking at the map, line 5 is `#{..`#####`, which at (36,12) would be the fourth character, which is `.` (floor). So yes, moving south from (36,11) to (36,12) is possible. Then, from (36,12), the agent can move east to (37,12) which is a wall, or see if the boulder is at (38,11). 

Alternatively, the agent could move west to (36,11), then north to (36,10), but not sure. The key is to get around the wall and position oneself to push the boulder towards the fountain. 

Given the constraints, the agent needs to navigate around the wall blocking the south. Moving west to (36,11), then south to (36,12), then east to (37,12) (which is a wall), so that's not helpful. Alternatively, from (36,11), move east to (37,11) again. 

Alternatively, check the bars adjacent to the agent: north, northeast, east, and northwest. That means those directions are blocked by bars. So the agent can only move south, west, or southeast if possible. But moving south is blocked by a wall. Moving west to (36,11), then south to (36,12), which is floor. From there, moving east to (37,12) is a wall. Then, maybe move south again to (36,13), but not sure. 

The boulder is at (38,11). The agent is at (37,11). To push the boulder west to (37,10), but need to check if that path is clear. The agent would have to move west to (36,11), then south to (36,12), then west to (35,12), etc., but that might not be the quickest path. 

Alternatively, the agent can try to push the boulder south-west. If the boulder is at (38,11), pushing southwest would move it to (37,10). But is there a fountain there? The fountain is near south and southsouthwest, so maybe (38,12) or similar. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent should move to the southwest direction to get around the wall and push the boulder towards the fountain. 

But given the current position and the walls, the best action might be to move west to (36,11), then try to push the boulder from there. However, the boulder is at (38,11), so the agent needs to be adjacent to it. 

Wait, the agent is at (37,11). The boulder is adjacent southeast, which would be (38,11) or (37,12). Since (37,12) is a wall, the boulder must be at (38,11). To push it, the agent needs to be to the northwest of the boulder, so at (37,10) or (36,11). But the agent is at (37,11), so to get to (37,10), they need to move north, but that's blocked by bars. To get to (36,11), move west. 

So move west to (36,11), then from there, push the boulder east? No, because the boulder is at (38,11). Alternatively, from (36,11), move east to (37,11), then push the boulder south to (38,12), but (38,12) might be a wall or blocked. 

This is getting complicated. Maybe the best action is to move west to (36,11) to get a better vantage point and then try to push the boulder in a direction that leads it towards the fountain.
