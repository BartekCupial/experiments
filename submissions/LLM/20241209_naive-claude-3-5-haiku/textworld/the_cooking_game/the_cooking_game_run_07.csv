I am so happy to announce that you are now in the bathroom.

You can make out a toilet. The toilet is white. The toilet appears to be empty.

You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.

75,go west,,"-= Corridor =-
You find yourself in a corridor. A standard kind of place. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.



There is a closed fiberglass door leading west. There is an exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, there is no door. You need an exit without a door? You should try going south.

76,go north,,"-= Livingroom =-
You arrive in a livingroom. An usual one.

You can see a sofa. The sofa is comfy. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door.

78,go north,,"-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. An usual one.

You can make out a fridge. You can see a closed conventional looking oven in the room. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a table. The table is massive. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You can see a counter. The counter is vast. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.

There is a closed frosted-glass door leading north. There is an open patio door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.
