Ah, the backyard. This is some kind of backyard, really great ordinary vibes in this place, a wonderful ordinary atmosphere. And now, well, you're in it. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a patio chair. The patio chair is stylish. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You make out a patio table. The patio table is stylish. But the thing is empty. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the patio table! oh well. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a BBQ. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens.

There is a closed wooden door leading north. There is a closed sliding patio door leading west. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door.

I just think it's awesome that you're in a street now. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

You are in a driveway. A typical kind of place. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.



There is an open fiberglass door leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one.
