        "tags.\n\nBut in the current observation, the agent is at (x=42,y=11), and the vertical closed door is near southsoutheast. So from y=11, moving south might bring them closer. Alternatively, the agent is being blocked by walls when moving in some directions. It's possible that the doorway adjacent south is an open path, but further movement south is blocked by the closed door. So moving south, then kicking southeast or southsoutheast could be the correct path. But if moving south leads to a doorway, then perhaps through that doorway. Maybe the agent tried moving south, but the door is closed. Then the kick action is needed.\n\nAnother possibility is using the 'open' action on the closed door, but the user's possible actions include 'open' as opening an adjacent door. So if the agent is next to the door, using 'open' instead of 'kick'. However, if the door is locked, kicking is needed. The action kick is for locked doors. Alternatively, if the agent is a priest, perhaps they can use a spell to open it, but the available actions don't include spells unless they use items. The spellbooks are in the inventory, so maybe the priest can cast clairvoyance, but how? The possible actions don't include casting, so maybe they need to use the 'search' action for hidden doors if there are any.\n\nBut first, seems like the main block is the vertical closed door. So trying to kick it open. Since the door is in the southsoutheast direction, perhaps the agent is not adjacent yet. So they need to move towards it. Maybe moving southeast first, then kick. But if walls are in the way, moving isn't possible. \n\nLooking at the map: \n\nIn some of the steps, the map shows the agent at (42,11) with a ---.---.--- structure, possibly a corridor with doors. The closed door could be in a direction blocked by a wall. If moving south from y=11 to y=12, then southeast from there might be the door. Alternatively, perhaps search for hidden doors might be necessary if kicking doesn't work.\n\nBut considering previous attempts where the agent tried moving east or north, which were blocked by walls, the best bet might be to kick the door in the correct direction. From the latest observation's language, 'vertical closed door near southsoutheast' when at y=11, moving south to y=12, the door is near southeast. Then, after moving south to y=12, kick southeast.\n\nBut based on the latest observation: after moving south to y=12, the vertical closed door is near southeast, so the kick action towards southeast could work. The agent tried that in previous steps but possibly had formatting issues.\n\nThe key is that the agent must output the action in the exact format: <|ACTION|>kick southeast",
        "kick southeast",
        "kick southeast",
        "kick southeast",
        "kick southeast",
        "kick southeast",
        "kick southeast",
        "tags). The solution is to use the correct action from the right position. Since now in the current observation after moving south, the agent is at (42,12), the vertical closed door is near southeast. Therefore, attempting to kick southeast from here, using <|ACTION|>kick southeast",
        "kick southeast",
        "kick southeast",
        "kick southeast",
        "kick southeast, but the agent must make sure they're adjacent. Let me check the current observation when at y=12. In the map, when the agent is at y=12 (x=42), the vertical closed door is near southeast. So, moving to y=12 first, then kicking southeast from there. The prior error was not moving to the correct position before kicking. So the correct sequence is: move south (again), then kick southeast.\n\nBut in the latest observation, after moving south, the agent was at y=12 with the door near southeast. The user tried kick southeast and got \"solid stone\" message, meaning the kick was aimed at a wall. That suggests that even at y=12, kicking southeast isn't the right direction. Maybe the direction should be south instead? Wait, no. The vertical closed door is near southeast. If the door is vertical, perhaps it's oriented east-west. To kick it, maybe the agent needs to be east or west of it, but the agent is at (42,12) and the door is to the southeast, which might be (43,13). To kick, you need to be adjacent. So, from (42,12), southeast is (43,13). If that's a door, the agent needs to move to (43,12) then try kick east. Or perhaps the positioning is off.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the door requires using the 'open' action instead of kick. If the door is closed but not locked, using 'open' might work. However, using kick would still work regardless. If 'open' hasn't been tried, that's another option. But the user's allowed actions include 'open' for adjacent doors. But the agent might not be adjacent yet. So move towards the door, then use 'open' or kick if it's locked. Since previous kicks resulted in \"It's solid stone,\" perhaps the agent isn't targeting the door correctly. Maybe the door is in the southsoutheast direction. From y=11, moving southsoutheast might put them adjacent to the door. Wait, but moving diagonally isn't one of the listed actions. The actions include northeast, southeast, etc. If the agent is at (42,11), moving southeast would go to (43,12). If the door is southsoutheast, which would be (43,13), but the agent cannot reach there directly. So, maybe the door is east, and the agent needs to move east first. However, the current observations mention a horizontal wall adjacent east and west at y=12, so moving east might be blocked.\n\nAlternatively, the 'search' action might reveal hidden doors. If regular actions aren't working, maybe there's a hidden door nearby. The agent has a spellbook of clairvoyance, which could detect areas, but the possible actions don't include casting spells, maybe needing to read the spellbook. But the available actions listed don't include spellcasting. So maybe using 'search' is the alternative. \n\nBut the agent's goal is to reach the stairs down. The stairs up are nearby but not relevant. If the main block is the closed door, focusing on that. The best plan is to get adjacent to the door and kick it. From (42,12), southeast is (43,13). If the door is there, maybe the agent isn't adjacent and needs to move southeast but might hit a wall. Alternatively, perhaps the door is directly south but the agent can't reach it. \n\nAlternatively, the doorway adjacent south when at y=11 (look at latest language observation: doorway adjacent south) needs to be explored. If there's a doorway to the south already, moving south would go through it, but perhaps the door at southsoutheast is locked. Wait, but the agent was at y=11, tried moving south and was at y=12, with a vertical closed door near southeast. If moving south leads to y=12, but can't proceed further south due to a horizontal wall, the issue is in the southeast direction. Maybe the agent needs to move southeast from y=12, but if there's a horizontal wall adjacent east and west, moving east is blocked. \n\nGiven the confusion, another approach is to use 'search' for hidden doors. The agent has to try: <|ACTION|>search. That's allowable. But previous search attempts might have been skipped due to formatting. Maybe there's a hidden door nearby. If 'search' is successful, it might reveal a hidden door. Otherwise, the agent should attempt to kick in the correct direction. Given the previous attempts, perhaps the error is not being adjacent to the door. The agent needs to move in a direction until adjacent, then kick. \n\nAlternatively, if the door is vertical, the agent needs to face east or west and kick. For example, if the vertical closed door is to the east, kicking east. But given the confusion, perhaps the correct action is to ensure movement towards the door and then kick. From (42,12), the vertical door is southeast, which would require moving east first but blocked by a horizontal wall. This suggests that the path is blocked, and the agent needs to take stairs up instead. But stairs down are the goal, stairs up are present but not useful. \n\nAlternatively, consider using items. The agent has a spellbook of clairvoyance (item g). Clairvoyance would reveal the map. But how to use it? If possible to cast, maybe via reading the spellbook. The allowed actions don't specify how. Assuming standard NetHack controls, perhaps 'z' for zap or 'Q' for quiver, but since available actions list doesn\u2019t include these, perhaps the only way is through search or other actions. Hence, perhaps using 'search' here. \n\nBut the user's previous attempt to kick southeast from position (42,12) failed. Maybe the direction is 'southsoutheast', which isn't listed as an available action direction. The available actions only have eight directions: north, east, etc. So maybe correct direction for southsoutheast is southeast, but that didn't work. \n\nAlternatively, the vertical door is to the south, but there's a horizontal wall blocking it. Therefore, the agent needs to find an alternate route through exploring dark areas. The dark area adjacent north, northeast, etc. Maybe go north to check other paths. But since reaching stairs down is the goal, perhaps the door to the southeast is key, and the agent needs to keep trying to kick it from the right position. Perhaps even from (42,12), southeast is adjacent to the door, and kicking is the only way. Hence, correct action: move south to y=12, then kick southeast. Since previous attempt was made but maybe the kick command wasn't formatted properly. The user must enclose it correctly. So outputting <|ACTION|>kick southeast.\n</think>\n\n<|ACTION|>south",
