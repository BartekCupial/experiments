        "...\n\nSo the agent is currently somewhere. The observation notes two walls and the key. So agent's next move is to get the key.\n\nFirst, to move towards the key which is 3 right and 1 forward. The key is in the east direction (if facing north). So to get closer, the agent should turn right (east), but if it doesn't turn, then moving forward would only go north, but there's a wall 3 steps north, so moving forward now would be okay for the first two steps. Wait, no: walls are 3 steps forward from current position, so the agent can move forward twice without hitting a wall. But that's not helpful if the key is to the east.\n\nWait, perhaps the agent needs to first turn right (to face east), then go forward, since the key is 3 steps east. Turning right once would face east. Then go forward 3 times. However, the key is also 1 step forward (once you face north again). But now, how many actions are needed.\n\nBut right now, agent has the actions: turn left, turn right, go forward, pick up, drop, toggle. Must choose one action.\n\nCurrent state: direction is probably default (assuming the initial facing direction, perhaps north). So agent is at (0,0), facing north. To get the key at (3,1):\n\nThe key's position is 3 steps to the right (east) and 1 forward (north). So relative to agent's current position and facing. To reach it, the agent must move east three times and north once. But the movements require facing east and then north.\n\nSo first, agent should turn right (east), then move forward 3 steps. However, since the agent can only perform one action at a time, the immediate action here is to turn right so they can start moving east.\n\nBut according to the current observation, the agent's possible actions are to turn right, turn left, go forward, etc. Let me check if facing east is the correct first step.\n\nIf agent turns right once, now facing east. Then, next step would be to go forward. Moving forward three times would take them to the east three steps. Then turn left to face north again, move forward once, and then pick up the key. So the first action here should be to turn right. Then in subsequent steps, move forward.\n\nBut the agent can only take one action here, so the best next action is to turn right. That's why the correct answer is to turn right now, to start heading east toward the key's location.\n</think>\n\n<|ACTION|>turn right"
