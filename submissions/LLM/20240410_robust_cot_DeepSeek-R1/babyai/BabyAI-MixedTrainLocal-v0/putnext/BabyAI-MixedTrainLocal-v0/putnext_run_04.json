In previous attempts, maybe the assistant didn't follow the format, leading to defaults.\n\nTherefore, the correct approach now is to reason and output the action in the specified tags to avoid format issues.\n\nGiven the current observation: wall left, red ball forward. The agent needs to move to the ball. So action: go forward once\u3002\n\nIf moving forward once reaches the ball, then next action is 'pick up'.\n\nBut the environment might have a different setup.
