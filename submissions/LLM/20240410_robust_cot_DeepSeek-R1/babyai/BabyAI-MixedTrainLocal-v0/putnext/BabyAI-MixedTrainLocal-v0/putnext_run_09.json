        "selected action.\n\nGiven the repeated turning left and right without moving, the correct action now is to start moving forward. But to do so safely, must ensure no wall is in the way.\n\nCurrent observation: wall 6 steps forward. So moving forward 3 steps is okay.\n\nSo first step: 'go forward'. Move \ud55c \uc9d1 forward. However, this action might not yet reach the \u0431\ubb3c's location.\n\nBut in the currentObservation of the purple box being 3 left and 3 forward, after moving a step forward, maybe the position becomes 3 left and 2 forward (since moved one step close\u0441\u0441\u0435\u66f8\u8a18).\n\nBut.possible with each move,tersterms of left and forward steps decrease.\n\nBut due to previous actions being just turning, correct initial steps to move towards the purple box.\n\nBased on this, the best initial action is to start moving forward.\n\nBut the possible actions available are 'turn left', ' him right', ' go forward', ' pick up', ' drop', 'toggle'. \n\nSince the agent is not holdwalls any object yet, or in front of any object to toggle, 'turnturn left or right or move forward are valid.\n\nGiven the previous loops alternating turnaround, a better choice might be moving 'go forward' followed by turning left or right to \u0433\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432 in the proper direction each time to navigate toward the purple box.\n\nBut between moving and turning.\n\nHowever, given his complex position, the agent must take the first initial step towards the purple box.\n\nThus, the next action after the currentObservation should be to 'go forward'.\n\nBut need to make sure that after 'go forward', the steps index decrease.\n\nAlternatively, if facing a direction where obstacle will no matterstep reach purple box, then \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0439\u0442\u0438 \u043d\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e steps forward would be safe.\n\nBut since the wall is 6 steps ahead, initial 3 steps should be safe.\n\nTherefore, choose of 'go forward'.\n\nBut wait, the purple box is 3 left and 3 forward. So \"go forward\" reduces the forward demand, making it steps \uc694 overy forward and 3 steps right left.\n\nAlternatively, to turn in the direction that allows the agent to move towards the purple box by combining turn and forward actions.\n\nBut perhaps alternate code (repeatedly turning left and then moving forward) is wrong.\n\nHmm.\n\nGiven the time pressure to provide an answer, the correct action would be to start moving towards \u0442HE purple box. Hence, a 'go forward' action.\n\nBut after the previous 'turn left', which direction is the agent now facing?\n\nIf the agent m faced south, then 'go forward' would risiko going into a wall.\n\nAh, it's critical to know the agent's current direction to assess whether moving forward is allowed.\n\nBut since I have no visualization, perhaps theorutioning based on observation Inobstruction's positional reports.\n\nIn current Observation:\n\nwalls 6 steps forward and 2 steps right.\n\nPurple box \u04383 steps left and 3 steps forward.\n\nAssume that 'forward' is the current directionrelate agent is facing.\n\nThe walls 6 steps forward, so moving forward steps is safe. Purple box is 3 steps left and 3 steps forard.\n\nAGI must turn left to face the left direction, then move forward to reach Dueks step left, then turn back to original direction and move forward to cover the original 3 steps forward.\n\nBut to do that:\n\n1. Turn left (new forward is left from previous direction).\n\n2. Go forward 3 steps.\n\n3. Turn \u0430 right to face the original forward.\n\n4. Go forward 3 steps.\n\nAt this point, the agent would have washed the box's position and can 'pick up' oncinticay here.\n\nBut since each 'turn left'', forward now is toward the original left, movement forward there would step towards the left.\n\nAlternatively, agent turns left (now\u0e33\u0e33\u0e02\u0e36\u0e49\u0e19 which direction?), then moves forward 3 steps to cover Weft steps, then turns right or left again to face perpendicular direction to proceed.\n\nThe way from's problem's data  \u03c4his.\n\nGiven time constraints, perhaps the best next action is 'go forward' to start approaching, but this depends on current facing direction and possible walls.\n\nAlternative Answer:\n\n<|ACTION|>go forward",
        ".\n\nGiven the current observation: agent must first adjust direction to face west (turn left) to then move toward Purple box.\n\nThus, \"turn left\" action.\n\nBut maybe I'm misevaluating; what if agent should 'go forward' toward the box.\n\nBut in observations, the purple box's forward distance is 1.\n\nIf they are facing directly towards the box, moving forward reduces the forward steps. But here, for the forward, relative to the box's position, which is left and forward. So facing west may rotate 'forward' towards the left.\n\nIn any case, given the time and the goal to select the next immediate action, the correct sequence is: to turn left (facing west) and then start moving towards the box.\n</think>\n\n<|ACTION|>turn left"
